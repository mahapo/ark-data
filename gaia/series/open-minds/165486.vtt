00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Sometimes we
just have to go back to basics.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:10%
We're so sophisticated with
all the esoteric and secret

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:10%
information we've taken in
that we forget the building

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:10%
blocks of our own well-being--
mental, emotional,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.944 align:middle line:10%
and physical.

00:00:41.944 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
They're waiting
for our attention,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're not doing
anything about it.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
My guest today, Cyndi
Dale, is taking us back

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
into the story of light, color,
frequency, and our own energy

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:84%
matrix, which are
called chakras.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI DALE: Which are
called chakras, exactly.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's so funny,
because I think, oh, I

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.780 align:middle line:90%
know all about chakras.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.710 align:middle line:90%
I know the first one.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:90%
It's red.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.900 align:middle line:90%
The next one's orange.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:90%
And we have this really pat--

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
it's almost a kindergartner
notion of what chakras are,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.950 align:middle line:90%
if we paid any attention at all.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But in reading your
books, it's like these

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.740 align:middle line:84%
are the alive,
living centers we're

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:90%
working through every day.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They are.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:10%
They're animate.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:10%
They're vehicles
of consciousness,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:10%
and they come with
us when we die.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:10%
They're re-integrated
into the body

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:10%
as soon as we're conceived.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So they go with us across time,
so think about what they hold.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.330 align:middle line:84%
We're always taught that
chakras hold our memories.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.520 align:middle line:84%
They hold a record of
what we've gone through.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
They can project into
the future as well.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
different chakras are

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:90%
in charge of different tasks.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So your red one is in
charge of physicality,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and the orange one is
emotional, and so on.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But they spread
so far beyond us,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:84%
into different dimensions
and different areas

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual realms, and
they connect us to the earth.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the earth
itself has chakras.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So they're amazing
vehicles of consciousness.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.917 align:middle line:90%
I like that term.

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I do, too.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
We were just talking
off camera a minute ago,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to
really build this.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a primer
course on what they

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:90%
are multi-dimensionally.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Get into the depth of
chakras in this conversation.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But you just
mentioned something.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
the notion of intuition

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.675 align:middle line:84%
and that you have done other
shows on intuition regarding

00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:24.475 align:middle line:90%
the chakras.

00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, let's just go
there for a little bit, OK?

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.255 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Fantastic.

00:02:27.255 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%
We'll do that, and then
we'll get into the primers.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Love it.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
science and all that.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Terrific.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.549 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
one of the things--

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.235 align:middle line:84%
and I live in Sedona, so
half the people who are there

00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
are pretty lit up,
pretty psychic.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Tuned in.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Very tuned in.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And others are asking
those people, hey, what's

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.210 align:middle line:90%
happening in my life next?

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And I always say to
them, what the intuitive

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
is reading is what
you have already

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:90%
created in your own matrix.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:84%
They're pulling out pixels and
reflecting them back to you.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're all wired to be
able to read it ourselves,

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
but some of us are further
along toward that openness

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And you started chiming
in on this exact topic.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about probability
versus possibilities,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
versus things that are starting
to feel like a certainty.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And materialization is
just about to take place.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, and chakras are made
out of light and sound.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And we know how
to perceive them.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Even scientifically
we're starting

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:90%
to be able to perceive them.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And there's many, many chakras.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
There's actually probably
hundreds of thousands,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
but the ones that
are in the body

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
also project outside
of the body to create

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:90%
what's called the auric field.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And so when you talk about
that we have a field, we do.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:90%
We have an expanded field--

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic, sound-- that
we can see, that we can't see.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And it spreads across
time and space.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So we are literally living
in 11-plus dimensions

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:90%
We're living in our own history.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:84%
We're living in our present-day
reality, or potential reality.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:90%
We're living in the future.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this beautiful
cauldron constantly brewing

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:84%
inside of us about
what could happen,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
what's probably going
to happen, and then

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
what for sure is
going to happen.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So in my work as an
intuitive, people frequently

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:84%
want to know what's
going to happen.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And I have to back
them up a little bit

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:84%
and say, let's work with,
like you were saying,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
your field to see what's
coming in that's a possibility.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
It's probably not the
lottery, but I don't usually

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:90%
go there right away.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:90%
What's a probability?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:84%
That's a little closer
in to the physical body,

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:90%
to the denseness of who we are.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:90%
And what's a certainty?

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if something's
a certainty,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.822 align:middle line:84%
it's landed in the
body that is a field.

00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the body's
just oscillating

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:90%
fields of light and sound.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So you can sense or see
or feel or even hear.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Possibilities are
going to be out here.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.455 align:middle line:84%
Probabilities are
going to be right here,

00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:90%
and certainties-- they're in.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.350 align:middle line:90%
They're landed.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Something's for sure
going to happen.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So different chakras hold
different intuitive gifts.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Some of them can help you see
psychically, or with your eyes.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Some can help you hear
or feel or be aware.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So I like to have
people figure out

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:84%
their best way of knowing so
they can gauge where something

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.634 align:middle line:90%
is in their life.

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So if there's
something maybe they

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:84%
want to write out, if it's
possible, they could do that.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Now would be a good
time to do that,

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's in
the possibilities stage.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, because
whether it's probability,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.620 align:middle line:84%
possibility, or landed, this
is all a product of our own

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
either mind desire or
soul's desire, anyway.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:90%
We have created it.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
when people say,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
so what's going to
happen in my life?

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, what would
you like to have happen?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:90%
What have you asked for?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:90%
And this is really important.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the mental aspect

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:84%
of this creation and its
possibility/probability.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, scientists
are starting to show

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that what shows up in our life
is a projection of emotion

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:90%
and mentality.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's what we feel
really strongly.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
You can't just half-wish
something or sort of

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:90%
want something.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.840 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel it
and mentalize it.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's not quite like some
people perceive, I think,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
the law of attraction
or visualization.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about having a
pretty picture in your mind.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to actually project
that image or that knowing

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
or that feeling or mentality--
which doesn't have to be

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:90%
a thought; it can be a knowing--

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
entirety of your body.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.159 align:middle line:84%
This is what's
cool about chakras.

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they go all the
way down through our body

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:90%
into the earth.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:84%
They're around us, and
they go on top of us.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
The energy centers more
on the top part of us

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.270 align:middle line:90%
are more spiritual.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So they're sort of like
what would we like.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
The ones in the middle of the
body are more psychological,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:84%
so they're like what
are we ready to receive.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can say we
want a relationship.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Have we worked
through the issues?

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Have we worked through
our childhood traumas?

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Do we really want
somebody living with us?

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Which I would say at
this moment no for me.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.250 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] You sort
of have to be honest.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Dogs are OK.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Not sure about the
rest of it yet.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And then the really physical
dense energy centers

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
are in the hips area
on the way down.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you really want
to receive something--

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and we are receiving
something all the time.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So what we want is
showing up, but if we

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:84%
want to alter the
path, you also have

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to alter what messages
you're sending out

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and what you're
willing to receive,

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to make a physical
change to receive

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
something solid and real
in those lower chakras.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times people do
a picture, but that's a peer.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:84%
You've got to feel it or
generate it in the body also.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And another much maligned
word, certainly in Buddhism,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:90%
as, desire.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
The reality is there is
nothing in the universe that

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:90%
exists without desire.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:12.645 align:middle line:84%
There was a desired outcome
by some thing or someone.

00:08:12.645 --> 00:08:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the use
of desire in the proper way

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.890 align:middle line:84%
to create this ultimate outcome
you'd like to see and then

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.275 align:middle line:84%
the feeling that desire
fuels, like, oh god,

00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:27.825 align:middle line:84%
that would feel so good, I'd
be so satisfied with that--

00:08:27.825 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
that's what you're
talking about.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where it has to
feel and flow through the body.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Because it's
full, and so it's

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:84%
going to be physical,
emotional, mental,

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:84%
all those things that we
have to return to the basics.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all those levels.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Years and years ago,
I was in Morocco.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:90%
I had a dream.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was a master
manifestor in my dream

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:90%
and crowds of people around him.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And I fought my way in
the dream to find him.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And he saw me and
kind of ignored me.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:84%
About two years after
that, a friend of mine

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
brought me to a
seminar, and he goes

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:84%
there's some master manifestor
teaching the seminar.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.417 align:middle line:90%
And I went into the class.

00:09:08.417 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:90%
There might have been 60 people.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, he was
the man in the dream.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:90%
It was him.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So I budged my way through,
like I did in the dream.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I sat on the floor in the
front, and I literally

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:90%
said, how do you do this?

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And you know what he
taught us, was desire.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:90%
It was desire.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Know it.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Taste it.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Smell it.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Be it.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.434 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have to become
it to some extent as well.

00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And I bring that up because
in the New Age parlance,

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:90%
it's rid oneself--

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
especially, again,
if you go more

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:90%
toward the Eastern tradition--

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:84%
is all suffering
comes from desire.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, all manifestation
comes from desire.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So unless you're willing
to go with your little bowl

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and accept alms from the
public and live however

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:84%
life is going to dictate
for you, desire is critical.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And not only that; it's
a lovely feeling to have.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a scary
thing for many people

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
who run the world or
religions to allow

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:84%
their followers to understand
the importance of desire.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Because then they can
obtain their desires,

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
their needs, their
wants, their wishes.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:84%
They can be good to others just
standing in their own power

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and exchanging
goodness with others.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:90%
You don't necessarily need--

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.680 align:middle line:84%
it's great to have-- but you
don't necessarily need them--

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
the sacred scriptures, the
one that they say you need,

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:84%
or that particular
leader or teacher.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Desire
gives you power.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It gives you power
and you become empowered.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.339 align:middle line:90%
Over your own reality.

00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Your own reality
and your reaction to it.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
reflection of your desire.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or the
default position

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:84%
where you let other
people program it for you.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Which we've done.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, by the time we
emerge from childhood,

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:90%
it's like The Matrix.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And again, I go
back to the chakras,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:84%
because they're just
so symptomatic of what

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.230 align:middle line:84%
we've got going on, every of
these subtle energy bodies.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And they also impact
the physical world.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:84%
They're made out of
physical and subtle energy,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
measurable and
immeasurable, and is

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:90%
able to convert one to another.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in my way of looking
at reality, have two levels.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.430 align:middle line:90%
There's an inside to a chakra.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:90%
They emanate from the body.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:90%
They're vortexes.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:84%
They go forward and
backward, into the sides,

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:84%
into various realms,
physical and spiritual.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's an external aspect
to them and an internal.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the internal
has our spirit encoded in it,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and the external
is the programming.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So we're programmed to have our
limbic system tell us or bring

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:84%
in information about
how to survive.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:84%
We are born biologically
ready to fit in with the clan.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.880 align:middle line:84%
We are also capable and
able to do higher thinking

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and break away and transform
all those programs.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the internal
part of a chakra that

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
holds sort of how we really
can do this, how you can really

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
be in love and grace and
truth and have your bills paid

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
and feed your dogs and
get somewhere on time.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And the outer layer, though it's
not bad, is just so encrusted.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It's dense, and
it's so encrusted

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:90%
with what doesn't fit us.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Many of us--

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I, for one, have spent
much of my life just

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
trying to get rid of stuff
that's on there and fix it,

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:84%
instead of going, you
know, there's probably

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:84%
some truth inside of me
I could open to that.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:90%
And that will help.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.980 align:middle line:84%
That will jettison some
of the dead weight.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:90%
So I can also go for the light.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I can also know what's
really accurate,

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to help
transform those subconscious

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.762 align:middle line:90%
or encoded programs, too.

00:12:58.762 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again,
you're going back to that,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
understanding the desire to
want to break free of that, that

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:84%
to break through that you have
to have a strong enough desire

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.136 align:middle line:84%
to say, I'm not going
to live that program.

00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was really lucky.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.890 align:middle line:84%
By age two, there was kind of a
traumatic event that happened,

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
which was good because
it separated me out

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:90%
from everybody.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of
moved into this place

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.016 align:middle line:90%
where I was a free agent.

00:13:22.016 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Good for you.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't
listen to anybody else.

00:13:23.895 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Good for you.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't want
to know their opinions.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.552 align:middle line:90%
I did exactly what I wanted.

00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You were you.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My father
said, my god, you just

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
knew what you wanted
and did what you wanted.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very quiet thing.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't a lot
of intention in it.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.270 align:middle line:84%
It was just unplugging from
all exterior programming

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:90%
as a result of a trauma.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You weren't
fighting against.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I had
nothing to fight against.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I was not connected
to anything else.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I was more of a fighter.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I had read the Bible
as much as a kid can,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:90%
seven times by third grade.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm white Wonder
Bread Norwegian Lutheran.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm Lutheran, too.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:84%
I almost got damaged by it,
but I just didn't buy it.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.644 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's very boring.

00:14:07.644 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is very boring.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I didn't, either.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So I kept reading
the Bible going,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:90%
what are they seeing in this?

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course what
I pulled out was

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
very different than what
the pastor was pulling out

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle line:84%
or the youth minister
was pulling out.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I was like, look, they're doing
these super cool miracles.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Jesus is
walking on the water.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:84%
There's this dude named
Elohim, if I'm saying it right,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.296 align:middle line:84%
that's not the Jehovah,
this male and female.

00:14:31.296 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Like, how come
we're not learning

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:90%
about this in Sunday school?

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think I more
actively fought

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:84%
what was in my world and life,
which inevitably led me to ask,

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
so it may be is a
little bit more real.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.450 align:middle line:84%
There's truth in
almost everything.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
But so how am I going
to understand the world?

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Which for me led
to subtle energies

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and looking into the
invisible and trying

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:90%
to figure all that out.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it led
you onto that path.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And I became a free thinker
and being at that point,

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.850 align:middle line:84%
because I'd asked some salient
questions certainly by five

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:90%
and six.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And the answers
were so stunningly

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:17.692 align:middle line:84%
simple and inaccurate and
so dogmatic that I said, no.

00:15:17.692 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's the same for me.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.941 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm doing this.

00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a choice.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I had to go every week to
Sunday school and church.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.374 align:middle line:90%
I thought, no problem.

00:15:24.374 --> 00:15:26.040 align:middle line:84%
There's Kool-Aid and
cookies at the end.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm in it for that.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
My problem was one
time they brought

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.300 align:middle line:84%
in a man who said there's really
demons, which I already knew.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And he had them fly this
megaphone around the room.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is going, ooh, and I'm
going, oh, that's kind of cool.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.857 align:middle line:84%
Could I do that without
a demon, please?

00:15:42.857 --> 00:15:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now, by the
time you were a little girl,

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
you were already seeing
into these other--

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I saw.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.379 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You could see.

00:15:48.379 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I could see.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:90%
I heard spirits.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:90%
I heard ghosts.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I saw colors, which
I inevitably ended up

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.520 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the chakras,
which of course emanate

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
in multi-colors and the
fields that do that.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I could
interact with fairies

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:90%
or angels or dark stuff.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.500 align:middle line:84%
There was stuff that
wasn't all that good--

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:90%
out that, too.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So I was very open, and I
learned by a pretty young age

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:90%
not to bring it up very often.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:90%
I wrote stories, so that helped.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.219 align:middle line:84%
Because I could record it in
another way and keep it alive.

00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how
did it functionally

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:84%
work in your family and
with your family's adult

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.750 align:middle line:90%
friends and all that?

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, their
adult friends never knew.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:90%
My parents never told them.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:84%
My parents just
said it was weird.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:84%
My dad was more
open, but he would

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:84%
say there's a lot of black
stuff with the good stuff.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:90%
So just don't go there.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's what he always said.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:90%
And my mom was more--

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting, because
back then she would say,

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:84%
don't make things up, you're
just making things up.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:90%
But I was right.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what got me in trouble.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.328 align:middle line:84%
It would be like,
well, mom, you're

00:16:55.328 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:90%
the one who ate all the cookies.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Blaming
everybody else.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Or I can tell when
you're going to get mad.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle line:90%
You turn red.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:90%
There's red coming out.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:90%
"I don't get mad."

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think there
was more defensive

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:90%
posturing at that point.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
is that she's now 90.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And about 10, 20 years ago, she
started doing dream analysis.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.930 align:middle line:84%
She's as psychic as
they come at this point.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.220 align:middle line:90%
She lost a friend.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:90%
She's in a senior place.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:90%
We went to her friend's place.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:84%
My mom starts talking to the
soul of the deceased friend.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Or if I say something
like, mom, I

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:84%
think I'm going to
be selling my land,

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.753 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to sell, she'll go,

00:17:32.753 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:84%
oh, it'll sell tomorrow,
it's going to sell tomorrow.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So really, like you
said, it's in all of us.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
We have to get
out of our own way

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and be a lot less concerned
with what other people are

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.920 align:middle line:90%
going to think.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's breaking
that crust, that programming.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You break the crust.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.970 align:middle line:84%
You get out of the
bad tribal mentality,

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
where it's all about you
instead of about communing.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.370 align:middle line:90%
So I love all the anecdotes.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I love where we've been
playing in this story.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
But now I want to start taking
people into the science of it,

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.260 align:middle line:84%
because there's some
new science emerging

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:90%
about these subtle fields.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And so let's start
with the science

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and then go into the
practical understanding

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and use of these incredible
multi-dimensional fields.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was
some substantiation

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
about the chakras back in the
1970s when Dr. Valerie Hunt was

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.974 align:middle line:84%
actually able to
record the chakras that

00:18:24.974 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:90%
are, of course, in the body.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And they also extend
beyond the body.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And determine the colors of
them and the sounds of them.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So what ancients have been
saying is all of a sudden,

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:90%
wow, this is very, very real.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.250 align:middle line:84%
We've been able for decades
to actually perceive

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:84%
the auric fields and different
types of electromagnetic fields

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:90%
that come off the body.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.080 align:middle line:84%
We've actually been able to
hear those fields as well,

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and I think they're
extensions of the chakras.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And the third part
of the puzzle--

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.590 align:middle line:84%
we haven't really
mentioned them--

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:84%
are what the traditional
Chinese medical professionals

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:90%
call the meridians.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.260 align:middle line:84%
That's more the Asian
idea of channels that

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:90%
flow in and through the body.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:90%
The Hindus call them the nadis.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:84%
They're slightly
different, however.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:84%
The nadis are actually
more nervous system.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:84%
The meridians are in
the connective tissue.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:16.180 align:middle line:84%
But we've proven that these
flow through the body.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:84%
We can't see them with an
X-ray, but scientists have used

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:84%
radioactive isotopes to
actually track the movement--

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.997 align:middle line:84%
it's brilliant--
of the meridians.

00:19:25.997 --> 00:19:26.796 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:26.796 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Jean-Claude [INAUDIBLE] did that
experiment in France years ago.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.578 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it was amazing.

00:19:31.578 --> 00:19:35.260 align:middle line:84%
He became a hero to
the East, because they

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.390 align:middle line:84%
had for the first time
proof positive in physical.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's real.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that they
could see that it's real.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.314 align:middle line:84%
And the Institute
of Heart Map is

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:84%
one of those
organizations that is now

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:84%
showing that we're
interconnected

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.160 align:middle line:90%
through our fields.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:84%
You can take the heart cell,
two heart cells out of somebody,

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:90%
put them great distances apart.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.945 align:middle line:84%
When something
happens to one, it

00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:90%
occurs in the other heart cell.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can even
do that with people

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
who are close to each other
with their heart cells.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So we are obviously
interconnected.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm sort of a geeky
nerd on this data.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when I analyzed
the chakras initially,

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I found it fascinating that
each of the energy centers

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:84%
was connected to a
different dimension.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So the first chakra in the
hip is very first-dimensional,

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:20.890 align:middle line:90%
which is sort of like a point.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:84%
The second chakra
is more like a line.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.570 align:middle line:84%
The third, you start
to be cubistic.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of the
newest brain research

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
is showing that the brain
fires neurologically

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:34.420 align:middle line:90%
in 11 different dimensions.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And every time it's firing
in a specific dimension,

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
there's a certain geometrical
formation that it is creating,

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.814 align:middle line:84%
which from my analysis actually
match the different chakras.

00:20:47.814 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's fascinating.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
in our subtle organs

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.139 align:middle line:90%
is also occurring in the brain.

00:20:54.139 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about geometrically

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:90%
what it looks like.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.770 align:middle line:84%
You already gave
a point, a line.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: A point, a line, a cube.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And now you start to
go fourth-dimensional

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:90%
in the heart.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So how do you picture
the fourth dimension?

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.110 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:84%
They always show
sort of like a cube

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:90%
with an arrow going out of it.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.360 align:middle line:84%
So now, all of a sudden,
you're somewhere else.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.330 align:middle line:84%
You can be in different
times all at the same time.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So you start to go in
the fifth dimension.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And these are
harder to describe.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can use
different kinds of forms.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.625 align:middle line:90%
You can get into hedrons.

00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Into nonphysical
essentially by then.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's nonphysical.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But I like to think
of the fifth dimension

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:84%
kind of from a more
negotiate a way

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
that you can work with the
information point of view,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:84%
as being able to
perceive reality

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:45.190 align:middle line:84%
as if you're in the bubble
of reality looking out.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of
the sixth dimension

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.050 align:middle line:84%
as if you're outside
of reality, looking in.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And I've had that experience,
like you're actually

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.270 align:middle line:84%
outside of it, like
when you're dead

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:90%
and you're looking back down.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.260 align:middle line:84%
You're out of whatever
it is that you're

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
trying to perceive
looking at it--

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
so how functionally
objective we can be.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.520 align:middle line:84%
The seventh is where I think
it starts to get interesting,

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
because you're
sort of in and out

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:90%
at the same time at that place.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the times I
experienced that, I had just

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:90%
been doing some work.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:90%
I felt the Christ presence.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
in this in and out

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and being everything
all at the same time.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting
on my front steps,

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:90%
and I was watching a butterfly.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, hi,
butterfly, right in my head,

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:39.520 align:middle line:84%
and it came up, fluttered
up, landed on my wrist,

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
actually, and said,
I'm not a butterfly.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm a [INAUDIBLE]
which was interesting.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I never met a
[INAUDIBLE] before.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And it proceeded to show me what
it was and what it really did

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:84%
and how it delivered
information to the flowers,

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.650 align:middle line:90%
and the bees did the same thing.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, I
really like living this way.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So the farther we
get numerically

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
dimensions, I think

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
the more grounded we can be,
but the more outstretched

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:90%
we can be at the same time.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
it-- because everything

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.140 align:middle line:90%
is light and sound and color.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
You start getting to
the seventh chakra,

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and once you start reaching
into those violet rays,

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:84%
now it's going beyond
the visible spectrum

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and those higher
dimensions beyond it.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
chakras and what

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:84%
you've seen in terms of
the whole notion of colors

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that we may not see
when you're looking

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.570 align:middle line:90%
at the dimensionality of color--

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean of chakras.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Colors that we don't
even see in the spectrum.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:84%
How does it look when
you're looking at, say,

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:84%
all of the dimensions of,
let's say, the third chakra.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:90%
What would that look right?

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, if you were
actually in the chakra,

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:84%
it would actually be
more or less clear,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:84%
because we start to add
the so-called coloration

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
through what they
call the astral plane.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So here is physical,
and just outside of that

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is what some call
etheric and emotional.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
an astral plane,

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:84%
which is really
everywhere at once,

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and there's different
layers to it.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's the layer that
adds the coloration.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be able
to connect with it

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.960 align:middle line:84%
to actually perceive the
yellow color inside, which

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.041 align:middle line:90%
is sort of interesting.

00:24:21.041 --> 00:24:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they're kind of
clear, to be really honest.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't normally say that,
because it breaks the rule

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.520 align:middle line:90%
book.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.895 align:middle line:84%
And then people
go, well, I don't

00:24:27.895 --> 00:24:29.665 align:middle line:90%
want to see a clear chakra.

00:24:29.665 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:90%
I want to see a color.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you're all open, you
will see that energy center

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.070 align:middle line:90%
as yellow in its functionality.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.730 align:middle line:84%
But once you get
even more expanded,

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:90%
you can't describe those colors.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.545 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's what
people say when they die,

00:24:44.545 --> 00:24:46.170 align:middle line:84%
when they have
out-of-body experiences.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are some
people actually who have--

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember if it's a
specific type of rod or cone

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.490 align:middle line:90%
in the eye.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:84%
They can actually
perceive millions

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:90%
more colors than most of us can.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And certain types
of flies or spiders

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.000 align:middle line:90%
can see or perceive ultraviolet.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So what they perceive is really
different than what we can.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we, with our
eyes, are only seeing--

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it's 0.0035% on
a linear scale of color

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.000 align:middle line:90%
of what's out there.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.120 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So we have the capacity to
perceive all those other colors

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:90%
and colorations.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.470 align:middle line:84%
We just have to be
a little bit more

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:90%
open so we don't get stuck.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:84%
At the so-called astral, which
would be about right here

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.250 align:middle line:90%
for most of us.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.320 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing
to let more energy come

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:84%
in from beyond it to give
us, even if nothing else,

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.070 align:middle line:90%
the feeling of more colors.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists think that
until maybe age two months,

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:90%
two years--

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:84%
it depends on who
you research, and I

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
don't know if I know how
to say this word right--

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:90%
that we all have synesthesia.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:84%
What that is is the ability
to, when you see a color,

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.080 align:middle line:90%
you can hear it.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Or when you hear a sound,
you can see a color.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Or when you have a feeling,
you can see and hear something.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, when we're
interacting with the chakras,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
they can open us in a
way that maybe we're

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.620 align:middle line:84%
using our sixth chakra,
which is in the brow, where

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:90%
we see pictures.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.954 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we can also hear the
picture at the same time.

00:26:18.954 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
interesting you say that.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I was on the trail
of light and color and sound.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I was dedicated to
that, and I was actually

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:84%
giving little classes and
workshops on color therapy.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.139 align:middle line:90%
This is like 30 years ago.

00:26:32.139 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Well, we still need it.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we do.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I was chasing the
story down in Europe

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
with all of the top physicists
who were using light, sound,

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:41.584 align:middle line:90%
and color in healing.

00:26:41.584 --> 00:26:43.375 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I came
across an interview

00:26:43.375 --> 00:26:45.820 align:middle line:84%
with Jean-Claude [INAUDIBLE]
right after that experiment

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:90%
had taken place, actually.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But what I would do
in these classes was--

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.300 align:middle line:90%
I found it fascinating--

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I would take big theater
lights with gels, colored gels,

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would have everybody
in the class or the audience

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:04.540 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot blindfolded,
so they couldn't really

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.300 align:middle line:84%
perceive the color even
through their eyelids.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And I would ask them to
begin feeling and telling me

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:90%
how they were just feeling.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
rare exception where

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:84%
a person didn't automatically
start giving the associated

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.950 align:middle line:84%
feelings of blue light versus
red or yellow, any of them.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I would take them into
the sound using the key note

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and music on that
key note of color

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:90%
and what would happen with them.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.080 align:middle line:90%
And people intuitively just--

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.180 align:middle line:84%
they're sensing and
feeling it all the time.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We are, anyway.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:90%
We just narrow ourselves.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't choose
to consciously work with it.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.228 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean, I've even
stopped consciously working

00:27:44.228 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:90%
with it to a large extent.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I was so
excited about talking to you.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into
the notion that you

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
have this front chakra
and the back chakra

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:84%
and what each one is
performing energetically.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
easiest to talk about

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.814 align:middle line:84%
with what's the seven in
body chakra system, which

00:28:01.814 --> 00:28:03.730 align:middle line:84%
is the most well-known,
just because there was

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.106 align:middle line:90%
a book published in the '20s.

00:28:06.106 --> 00:28:08.230 align:middle line:84%
It came to America that
everybody said, oh, there's

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.074 align:middle line:90%
seven chakras--

00:28:10.074 --> 00:28:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Sir Arthur Avalon, though he
actually said there were six.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:90%
But anyway.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:14.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So they're vortexes
of light, and they

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:84%
operate with different
bands of energy or colors

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.760 align:middle line:84%
or sound on the electromagnetic
and sound spectrum.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.190 align:middle line:90%
And so they emanate from us.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
They're locked into
us, but they're also

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:84%
generated, I
believe, by energies

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:36.070 align:middle line:84%
that come to us from
the heavenly realms

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:90%
and the physical world as well.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So from a structural
point of view,

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.250 align:middle line:84%
each of these
in-body chakras has

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:45.970 align:middle line:84%
a front side, which sort of
swirls out into the world,

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and that side of the
chakras really operating

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:90%
in our conscious domain.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So what we think can
be perceived by others,

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:84%
we can get a sense of what's
happening in the real world.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.400 align:middle line:84%
We can project our desires
through the forward vehicles,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they'll
land somewhere.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And something might happen.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.910 align:middle line:84%
The backside
chakras go backward,

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.560 align:middle line:90%
and they swirl back there.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.290 align:middle line:84%
They're much more our
unconscious vehicles.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:16.210 align:middle line:84%
They certainly send
energy into the domains

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.550 align:middle line:84%
of spirit and
spirituality and soul,

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.620 align:middle line:84%
but I love working
with the backsides.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Because I find it most
empowering to bring energies

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:90%
in through them.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to say.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Aren't they receivers?

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They're receivers.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Bring them in.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Bring in virtues.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Bring in powers.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Bring in desires.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Bring in guides.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Bring in help.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Bring in whatever it is
you want to bring in.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Because think of it just
from a physical perspective.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Bringing in a really
cool, big, strong energy

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.600 align:middle line:84%
from the back side,
coming through the front,

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.470 align:middle line:84%
is going to push
forward anything

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.220 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't match
that positive energy,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.520 align:middle line:84%
that enlightening energy,
that true desire or wish.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.530 align:middle line:84%
It's going to push
everything out of the way.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It's going to bring into the
physical, conscious domain what

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.410 align:middle line:84%
it is that's really
real and true.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:10%
It's going to clear
the way for you.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.140 align:middle line:10%
So I work mainly
with the back sides.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody's
really sick, I may

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.800 align:middle line:84%
bring in through the
back side the energy

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:84%
that they need through
all the chakras

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:84%
of the correlated chakras
what's going to help drive

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:84%
out the so-called negative
energy, whatever word you want

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:84%
to use, what's not working,
and bring in what they do need.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.632 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how you're going
to get the transformation.

00:30:25.632 --> 00:30:27.340 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come in
through the chakra,

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:84%
immediately be delivered
into the physical body,

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
be spread through the
meridians or the nadis,

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:90%
extend through the auric field.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So even as the body isn't
yet maybe properly physically

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:44.690 align:middle line:84%
healed, you can now draw to you
the kind of people or events

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.902 align:middle line:84%
that can help
finish the process.

00:30:46.902 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Isn't that a
cool way to look at it?

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.818 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is,
and I want to talk

00:30:50.818 --> 00:30:55.737 align:middle line:84%
about how we work with
intention in just a second, too.

00:30:55.737 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I've always
noticed in my life

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.410 align:middle line:84%
when I'm ready to
manifest something new--

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:84%
because there's time
in this dimension.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
kind of be gentle

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and I think pretty accepting
when it comes to time frames.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But what I find is it comes
up on the back side of me

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:90%
and starts pressing on my back.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I feel it
right here, I know

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:84%
it's about to drop
into physical reality.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.340 align:middle line:84%
But it always comes
from the back.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.769 align:middle line:90%
I feel it's happening.

00:31:25.769 --> 00:31:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And it drives you crazy
at that last stage.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.220 align:middle line:84%
You can't see the details,
per se, but it's there.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's almost itchy.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's itchy.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It's irritating because
it's ready to happen.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's moved back there from
possibility to probability,

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's just about to
drop into certainty.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe it enters
through the back side

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:90%
of the chakras.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
why I brought it up.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.830 align:middle line:84%
That makes perfect sense,
because that's where I always

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.076 align:middle line:90%
experience changes coming.

00:31:50.076 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yep, exactly.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And especially
big, profound changes

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.770 align:middle line:90%
in direction in life.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:56.907 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh.

00:31:56.907 --> 00:31:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And then it takes a month or
two, and boom, there it is.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:84%
At most, two or
three months out.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After it
becomes irritating.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:90%
But then you're open.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's dropped
in, you're sort of excited.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and it's
OK to be scared.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:84%
People ask me constantly,
can your fear get in the way?

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if it's landed,
it's more excitement than fear

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.434 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:32:18.434 --> 00:32:20.600 align:middle line:84%
But we do have that very
human part that goes, well,

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.683 align:middle line:90%
what if it doesn't happen?

00:32:21.683 --> 00:32:24.170 align:middle line:90%
It's like, honey, it's landed.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:25.880 align:middle line:90%
You can't be in the way now.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.380 align:middle line:90%
You can't get in the way.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.460 align:middle line:90%
So don't worry about it.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Just get on with it.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you kind of
alluded to some of it,

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:84%
but say if a person wants
to consciously start

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.280 align:middle line:84%
working with their chakras
and we're working now

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.780 align:middle line:90%
with the front and the back.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And you have a couple
of little techniques

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.790 align:middle line:84%
to use that I think you said you
had a couple that were really

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:90%
good to share with us.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.356 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that before we even

00:32:47.356 --> 00:32:49.090 align:middle line:84%
get into the details
of the chakras.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.000 align:middle line:84%
There's two techniques
I use all the time.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:84%
They're really reflective
of all the ancient processes

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:56.450 align:middle line:90%
and techniques.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:84%
They're short, they're
easy, and they work.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.630 align:middle line:90%
I like short, easy.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I do, too.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: OK.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:90%
One I call spirit to spirit.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It's so simple, it's
almost embarrassing.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.959 align:middle line:90%
I use it constantly.

00:33:07.959 --> 00:33:09.500 align:middle line:84%
When I'm going to
work with a client,

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:84%
if I need to perform a task,
if I have to clean the bathroom

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and I don't feel like
cleaning the bathroom,

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:90%
I simply affirm my own spirit.

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So there, you're really
giving yourself permission

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.120 align:middle line:84%
to come from your highest
place throughout the inside

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:84%
of each chakra, throughout
all aspects of you, including

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.710 align:middle line:90%
physical.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.990 align:middle line:90%
I affirm the other spirit.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, while we're talking, I'd
affirm your spirit or everybody

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:33.780 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you're alone, you're
affirming the helping spirits,

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and really just the
good parts of them

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.720 align:middle line:90%
can come into the process then.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the third activity is
to affirm the greater spirit.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, you're doing
what every single spirituality

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.610 align:middle line:84%
or 12 step program
tells you to do,

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:52.100 align:middle line:90%
which is let go and let god.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.516 align:middle line:84%
You're just saying,
you know what?

00:33:53.516 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm surrendering.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm a vehicle.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll receive.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.170 align:middle line:90%
I'll share.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I'll be whatever it
is I'm supposed to be,

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:02.816 align:middle line:84%
whether it's limited
or more open.

00:34:02.816 --> 00:34:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm working
with a client

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and I've done spirit to
spirit, they may ask me,

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.380 align:middle line:84%
when am I going to
meet Mr. or Ms. Right?

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't get anything,
it's not being delivered.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.920 align:middle line:90%
I'll say I don't get anything.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's ask a different question.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Or I can tell you that you
need to get a different job,

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.670 align:middle line:84%
or you might want to go
exercise or change your diet

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:30.139 align:middle line:84%
So I use that technique
for everything.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.719 align:middle line:84%
Because it provides you
protection, and it helps

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:34.820 align:middle line:90%
you come from a good place.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:38.969 align:middle line:84%
The second is more of
an active technique.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's a
delivery technique.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're in the mall
and you're seeing something

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.440 align:middle line:90%
and you can't call the police.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is being
mean to their kid,

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.750 align:middle line:84%
or you just know that
they're mean to their child.

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have enough in
order to alert the authorities.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.610 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, many of us sensitives
are giving away our energy.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.650 align:middle line:84%
We start going, oh, I'll help,
or I'll take on the pain.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Doesn't work.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're miserable, and it
doesn't help the situation.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Healing streams of
grace recognizes

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that there's a source,
whatever you want to call it--

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.170 align:middle line:84%
source, spirit-- that
is constantly emanating

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:90%
what I would call grace.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:90%
To me, grace is love and power.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Grace is actually going
to do something and make

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.990 align:middle line:90%
a difference.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:23.570 align:middle line:84%
There is endless
streams of grace.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Everything we needed before
we went into an event

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.430 align:middle line:90%
has already been created.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Everything we need can
be created in the moment.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's acknowledging
that there's

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:38.480 align:middle line:84%
this sort of eternal
support for us,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and it can be delivered in what
I would call streams of grace.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we're in a
situation and we

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:48.350 align:middle line:84%
need to send a prayer
to somebody, what I do

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.612 align:middle line:90%
is send the stream of grace.

00:35:50.612 --> 00:35:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
come through me.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.090 align:middle line:90%
I do spirit to spirit.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.430 align:middle line:90%
I ask for grace for that person.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.050 align:middle line:90%
It bypasses me.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to be
involved in the process.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to be codependent.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to rescue
them or take on their issues.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.280 align:middle line:90%
It goes directly to them.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Even in Target or the mall, if
I'm sensing something going on,

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I do spirit to spirit, tune into
the greater spirit, and say,

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.060 align:middle line:90%
would you help?

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Would you bring what they need?

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I've watched situations
where literally--

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:90%
this is kind of a spooky one--

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:22.790 align:middle line:84%
where I just had this bad sense
about a mom with her child.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:24.350 align:middle line:90%
You can just tell.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And I asked for the
streams of grace,

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and the next moment she
actually struck her child.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was good, because it
was in front of a clerk who

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.630 align:middle line:90%
called the police.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that
mother would never

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:84%
have been reported
to child services.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know
what's going to happen.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:90%
It's out of our hands.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.020 align:middle line:84%
If we're supposed to be
actively involved, we will be,

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.240 align:middle line:84%
because we've done
spirit to spirit as sort

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.220 align:middle line:84%
of our one-size-fits-all
we're in the right place.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.610 align:middle line:84%
If we're told, if we hear,
if we're shown something

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.710 align:middle line:90%
we need to do, we will do it.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise it's really
in bigger hands.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've done that.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I remember one
instance where a man

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:09.080 align:middle line:84%
was hitting a woman in the
front of the pickup truck.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I went over and
knocked on the window.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And she turned and looked at
me like, this is what we do.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It is what they do.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.117 align:middle line:90%
You can bet on that.

00:37:17.117 --> 00:37:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why are
you interrupting us?

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.590 align:middle line:90%
And that taught me a big lesson.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:90%
With children, it's different.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:84%
You feel compelled to do
something because of the lesser

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.065 align:middle line:90%
statue in power of the child.

00:37:29.065 --> 00:37:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Because
they can't do it.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they can't do it.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very interesting
type of interface.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Because yes, maybe
having done it your way,

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:43.977 align:middle line:84%
for example, to send the stream
of grace into their situation

00:37:43.977 --> 00:37:45.560 align:middle line:84%
might have been
something nothing more

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.720 align:middle line:84%
than a moment of the guy feeling
guilty, a flash of guilt.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Or her going, I
don't need to do this.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, or her saying,
doesn't feel good anymore.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We don't know.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We don't know.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But to go and physically
try to interrupt it

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.400 align:middle line:84%
when they're in the middle
of what they do together,

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.230 align:middle line:90%
it didn't work.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:01.310 align:middle line:90%
It was not helpful.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I work on the
phone most of the time.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And people, clients are
constantly saying, how can

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.430 align:middle line:90%
I feel the healing?

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.430 align:middle line:90%
You're not here.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:11.814 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I don't need to be.

00:38:11.814 --> 00:38:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I probably don't even
need to be on the phone.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:17.935 align:middle line:84%
It's coming directly to them
in the way and in the order

00:38:17.935 --> 00:38:18.935 align:middle line:90%
they need to receive it.

00:38:18.935 --> 00:38:20.351 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
need to receive it.

00:38:20.351 --> 00:38:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's one thing that
my beings I work with

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.990 align:middle line:90%
told me a long time ago.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:27.860 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see an
outcome handled well,

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.250 align:middle line:84%
then project that
to your guides,

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.705 align:middle line:84%
and allow the guides to
carry that forward and finish

00:38:33.705 --> 00:38:34.505 align:middle line:90%
that process--

00:38:34.505 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's right.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --with my intention.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Because they said the other
realms are so much more

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.580 align:middle line:84%
skilled at seeing how it
needs to be delivered,

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.560 align:middle line:84%
the way in which a
person can receive it,

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.010 align:middle line:84%
not my perception
of what they might

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.220 align:middle line:84%
need but the intention of
the healing for that in a way

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.570 align:middle line:90%
that they can receive it.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Or their perception.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their
perception, exactly.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I had a client
years and years ago--

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I even described this
interaction in one of my books.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.940 align:middle line:84%
She had lung cancer, so she
wanted me to work on her.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.870 align:middle line:90%
And we worked on it.

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.470 align:middle line:90%
We did a number of things.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And she came back in for
another session, and she goes,

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.610 align:middle line:84%
the strangest thing
happened after our session.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I started to get struck with
inexplicable bouts of joy.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.640 align:middle line:90%
And I'm taller.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.260 align:middle line:90%
I grew two inches over night.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.430 align:middle line:90%
I was like, well, that's cool.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Neither of us obviously
asked for that.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And the lung cancer
did dissipate,

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:84%
but I have no idea if it's
because of what we did.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.360 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
because of the chemo.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the chemo worked better.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she was taller, so
the cancer cells left.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.830 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:44.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't often get a deep
understanding of everything.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:46.130 align:middle line:10%
That's sort of the magic of it.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:47.240 align:middle line:10%
Is it just changes?

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.760 align:middle line:10%
And you can appreciate
it, and it's joyous.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is,
and the reality is

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.590 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing more
you can do to contribute

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:59.240 align:middle line:84%
than to see the highest outcome
for the person or the situation

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and then let the other
forces take that road

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.470 align:middle line:90%
at your instruction or desire.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:90%
We're still back to desire.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a desire
to see an outcome that

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.740 align:middle line:90%
works for that person.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:11.540 align:middle line:90%
So that's nice.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.760 align:middle line:84%
That's beautiful,
streams of grace.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
some of the tasks--

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.800 align:middle line:84%
we're getting back to
the technical part--

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the chakras are serving,
like the endocrine system

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, the things they
take care of within our matrix.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Excellent.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, I work with
the 12 chakra system,

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.310 align:middle line:84%
just because years
and years ago, I

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.890 align:middle line:84%
did know that there were
seven in-body chakras.

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what I perceived.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.830 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was taught.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But I also saw five
out-of-body chakras,

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.900 align:middle line:84%
which are really
fantastic to work with,

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.400 align:middle line:84%
because they afford a lot
more power, a lot more--

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.690 align:middle line:90%
one's connected to nature.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Another can help you command
natural and supernatural

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:50.430 align:middle line:90%
forces.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Another is a very
harmonic sort of chakra.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.320 align:middle line:84%
So whatever system you work
with, that doesn't matter.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Because each of the
chakras, whether they're

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:84%
physically found in
the body, they all

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.700 align:middle line:90%
anchor in the physical system.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.830 align:middle line:84%
They all anchor somewhere
in the spine, which

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:90%
is our neurological system.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.690 align:middle line:84%
They all manage some
endocrine gland.

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the one I
call the 10th chakra, which

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:84%
is underneath the
feet, actually,

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.390 align:middle line:84%
streams up through
the bone marrow,

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.510 align:middle line:84%
which actually is
an endocrine gland

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and manages our genes,
our ancestral memories,

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.390 align:middle line:90%
our epigenetic material.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So they all have a
very physical function.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, in the body, they
manage that part of the body.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.970 align:middle line:84%
But as the Asian systems
have known forever,

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:90%
it's not just about physicality.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Each chakra manages a different
psychological concern.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:47.230 align:middle line:84%
To me, psychology is a blend
of feeling or the feelings.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they have more to
do with fear, but always

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.870 align:middle line:90%
in relation to a belief system--

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:54.370 align:middle line:90%
so an emotion.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And so each of them is helping
to define or bring forth

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.840 align:middle line:90%
our true psychological profile.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So they manage something
about how we think

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and therefore how
we're going to act.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.450 align:middle line:90%
And they're all spiritual.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And within that
spiritual basket,

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I would say there's a
couple different categories.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.000 align:middle line:84%
One is each of
them is intuitive.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.330 align:middle line:84%
They provide us with certain
types of intuitive insight,

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and they share accordingly
with the world.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.670 align:middle line:90%
But they're also sort of tasked.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:26.860 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
the tree of life

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.170 align:middle line:84%
in so many of the
different indigenous

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and religious systems where we
are able to perceive ourselves

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:37.240 align:middle line:84%
as going from physical all the
way back to spiritual-- in god,

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.410 align:middle line:84%
if you would, as being physical,
spreading all the way back

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.370 align:middle line:90%
to the heavenly domains.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Each chakra holds its own in
helping us make that extension.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So we become spiritualized
through each of the chakras.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.350 align:middle line:90%
We don't leave them behind.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:57.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't become physical and
then emotional and then mental

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and then relational and then
communicative and then visual

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.090 align:middle line:90%
and then spiritual.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:08.140 align:middle line:84%
We become physical, is what
we first do in our lives.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we learn how to
spiritualize that while we're

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.470 align:middle line:84%
doing emotions and
spiritualizing those,

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:18.400 align:middle line:84%
while we're doing belief systems
and spiritualizing those.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.840 align:middle line:90%
So they're gateways.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Each is incredibly important.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:90%
There's not really a hierarchy.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And each assists us in
being who we really are.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.610 align:middle line:90%
While alive, we're physical.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So we can't just float
around in outer space.

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.780 align:middle line:84%
We need to do our real lives in
a way that's very spiritual--

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.080 align:middle line:90%
the chop wood, carry water.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.580 align:middle line:84%
What do you do
before enlightenment?

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.745 align:middle line:90%
You chop wood, carry water.

00:43:40.745 --> 00:43:41.620 align:middle line:90%
What do you do after?

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.240 align:middle line:90%
You chop wood, carry water.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So they're vehicles for
those ways of being,

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.120 align:middle line:84%
that people like to
say is enlightened

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.210 align:middle line:84%
or born-again or spiritual,
or whatever the code word is.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:55.801 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to toss
something at you here.

00:43:55.801 --> 00:43:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So a number of years ago--
maybe, I don't know, 10,

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:00.040 align:middle line:90%
12 years ago--

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.560 align:middle line:84%
my guides had said,
look, when you're

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.630 align:middle line:84%
working with your
chakras now, we just

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:06.310 align:middle line:84%
want you to be
aware of something.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm bringing it up,
because a woman just wrote me

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:13.620 align:middle line:84%
the other day and said this is
a vision she'd been given, too.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I want your
response on it.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And that was, they said,
do not focus energy

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:19.960 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom three
chakras any longer.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Go to the next three
above the head.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:25.240 align:middle line:84%
The bottom three are
well-enough developed now,

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're moving into the use
of the other eighth, ninth,

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.510 align:middle line:90%
and 10th now, is your journey.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And so other people are
obviously picking this up, too.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about this.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, this is
my perspective on that.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.064 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some
people who have not even

00:44:41.064 --> 00:44:43.480 align:middle line:84%
gone near their first, second,
and third chakras, and they

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.626 align:middle line:90%
better work on them.

00:44:44.626 --> 00:44:46.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, many
of them probably

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.700 align:middle line:84%
run organizations
or institutions,

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.226 align:middle line:84%
because they're still
playing on that level.

00:44:54.226 --> 00:44:55.600 align:middle line:84%
They're still
playing with money.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.040 align:middle line:84%
They're still
playing with power.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Total material realm.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They're still playing
with being bullies or misusing

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.210 align:middle line:90%
emotions.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think that some
people need to get

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:84%
those lessons the right way
and spiritualize those centers,

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:13.000 align:middle line:84%
or the world's going to
continue to be a mess.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
many, many people who

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:19.040 align:middle line:84%
have been working those levels
over and over and over again.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's the
grouping that's being told,

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.100 align:middle line:90%
look, you've got it; go bigger.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Go bigger, go better.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Go spiritual.

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Because most likely-- and
this is my intuitive sense,

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.540 align:middle line:84%
too, like the person who wrote
you and yourself-- you've

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.040 align:middle line:84%
already spiritualized
those chakras.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.840 align:middle line:90%
You're doing them.

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.780 align:middle line:90%
You're in them.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:40.230 align:middle line:84%
The more that you expand
to those moments of bliss

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and truth and virtues and
whatever else all the words are

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:47.380 align:middle line:84%
to higher guidance and what's
coming here to this planet

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.710 align:middle line:84%
to help everybody, like
what the kids are being born

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:54.200 align:middle line:84%
to bring in, it's going to land
in those energy centers anyway.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.840 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come into them
and become more physical.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.240 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
become solid, but it

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.180 align:middle line:90%
doesn't need to be the focus.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.180 align:middle line:90%
They're not cut off.

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:04.980 align:middle line:90%
They're there.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.302 align:middle line:90%
You just worked them.

00:46:06.302 --> 00:46:07.635 align:middle line:90%
They're already working for you.

00:46:07.635 --> 00:46:09.343 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
talk about eighth,

00:46:09.343 --> 00:46:10.800 align:middle line:90%
ninth, and 10th chakras.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So in my world--
and different people

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:15.990 align:middle line:84%
have different
levels of namings.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So to me, fifth is throat,
sixth is third eye,

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.390 align:middle line:90%
seventh is top of the head.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And in my realm-- and everybody
has a different system--

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:26.100 align:middle line:84%
the eighth chakra's
right above that.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.570 align:middle line:90%
It's right here.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's different in the
Incan system or Cherokee system

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.100 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.260 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's the
seat of the soul.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.710 align:middle line:90%
It's the mystical chakra.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the shaman chakra.

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that
has the records that

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.320 align:middle line:84%
cross time and
dimensions, where we truly

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.560 align:middle line:84%
can perform magical feats
and where we're constantly

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.600 align:middle line:84%
asking ourselves do
we want to interact

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:54.150 align:middle line:84%
with our Dharma, our purpose,
or the Karma, the heavy stuff.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So to me, that's one of the most
powerful chakras that we have.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:00.480 align:middle line:84%
It locks in, in my way
of understanding it,

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.280 align:middle line:90%
to the thymus.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.446 align:middle line:84%
What do we have in the world
right now, but all kind

00:47:03.446 --> 00:47:04.740 align:middle line:90%
of autoimmune dysfunctions?

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.190 align:middle line:84%
We better start working
with this energy center.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:10.020 align:middle line:84%
We better make some really
solid decisions about what

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and whom we're interacting
with in the invisible realms.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:16.620 align:middle line:84%
The ninth chakra's about an
arm's length above the head.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.650 align:middle line:84%
It composes itself
in the diaphragm.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Look at how many systems
are all about breathing.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:25.350 align:middle line:90%
You're breathing harmony in.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I see this energy
center as gold.

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:31.080 align:middle line:84%
In the income system,
this one is typically

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.800 align:middle line:84%
connected to these sort
of luminary powers.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.910 align:middle line:90%
It's gold energy.

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:37.080 align:middle line:90%
It's godly.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:40.680 align:middle line:84%
It's higher stuff
that can literally

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.530 align:middle line:84%
harmonize all of us, that
can bring us together

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:47.830 align:middle line:84%
on the same page, soul to
soul, person to person, brigade

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:48.840 align:middle line:90%
to brigade.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And literally,
it's about harmony.

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:53.630 align:middle line:84%
It's what we're trying
to do on this planet.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I call the 10th chakra the
one underneath the ground.

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:57.750 align:middle line:90%
That's nature.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:02.370 align:middle line:84%
We're certainly seeing that one
getting stirred up, are we not?

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
we interconnect

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.740 align:middle line:84%
to all the natural beings,
the natural world, the stars,

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.080 align:middle line:90%
the cosmos, the elements.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.090 align:middle line:84%
It's probably one of
the most primary ones

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:15.690 align:middle line:84%
right now for us to return
to and to understand

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:17.490 align:middle line:90%
that we are all these.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're in soul
form-- so we're dead--

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:24.300 align:middle line:84%
or alive, we're still part of
the fabric of the environment

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.470 align:middle line:90%
and nature.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I have
another one that I

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.870 align:middle line:84%
describe called the 11th
that I see really solidly

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:34.440 align:middle line:84%
around the hands and the feet,
but it's sort of in the energy

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.670 align:middle line:90%
field, too.

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:38.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the one
that people can use

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.710 align:middle line:84%
to command natural and
supernatural forces.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So those magicians,
those weather shamans--

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I've met some of them who
go, let's bring lightning.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.320 align:middle line:90%
You can do good with it.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.200 align:middle line:84%
You can do bad with it,
but that's the power.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.480 align:middle line:90%
And then my final one is--

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.650 align:middle line:90%
I call it the 12th.

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:57.210 align:middle line:90%
It surrounds us.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:02.730 align:middle line:84%
It's our personal scheme skein,
s-k-e-i-n, or skin of our--

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:05.850 align:middle line:84%
well, it's outside of all
the other auric fields.

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:07.170 align:middle line:90%
It connects in with the body.

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:09.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the skin of our spirit.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's how we can happily
bounce around as the spirit

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:17.700 align:middle line:84%
that we are, bringing in what
promotes our true nature,

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.130 align:middle line:84%
sending messages to the
world that only share

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:22.560 align:middle line:84%
what we're truly
supposed to be sharing.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.220 align:middle line:84%
You can still have those
days where you're going,

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't like this or I'm grumpy
or I want a Hostess Twinkie.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.434 align:middle line:84%
But if this energy
center's active,

00:49:33.434 --> 00:49:35.600 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to bring you
a Hostess Twinkie that's

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.540 align:middle line:90%
not good for you.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.120 align:middle line:84%
If it's good for you, in
comes a Hostess Twinkie,

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.590 align:middle line:84%
even if they're
not made anymore.

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:42.787 align:middle line:84%
I keep forgetting if
they're being made anymore.

00:49:42.787 --> 00:49:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING]

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.120 align:middle line:84%
They last like 20 years,
so you can still get one.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] On eBay.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You can, actually,
for like $3,000, most likely.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.900 align:middle line:90%
But we have these.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.870 align:middle line:84%
The point is, no matter what
your numerical system is,

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.780 align:middle line:84%
we have these
advanced chakras that

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:03.990 align:middle line:84%
connect us to different
realms and worlds

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and really do a lot
of the thinking for us

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:09.390 align:middle line:84%
if we let them, meaning
higher thinking.

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:12.690 align:middle line:84%
The other parts of us that
might get just kind of grumpy

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:14.490 align:middle line:90%
sometimes or cranky--

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:17.280 align:middle line:90%
they can keep being transmuted.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.494 align:middle line:84%
So let's take one chakra,
because I brought it up before.

00:50:20.494 --> 00:50:21.790 align:middle line:90%
So we'll just stay consistent.

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the third
chakra and look at that

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.770 align:middle line:90%
multi-dimensionally--

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:28.660 align:middle line:84%
the subtle colors, what
you already talked about,

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.560 align:middle line:84%
of course, the commonly
known color of yellow,

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.095 align:middle line:90%
association with the mental.

00:50:33.095 --> 00:50:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's just get into the
dimensions of one chakra,

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.114 align:middle line:84%
because we're not going
to get in to many.

00:50:39.114 --> 00:50:40.530 align:middle line:84%
People will have
to just pick up--

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:42.554 align:middle line:84%
I love your little
book of chakras.

00:50:42.554 --> 00:50:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Isn't it cute?

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just that
little, tiny book is

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.930 align:middle line:90%
so well-done, so well-written.

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:47.030 align:middle line:90%
I crammed a lot in it.

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.863 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So useful.

00:50:47.863 --> 00:50:49.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got so much
in your little book.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
if people want,

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:55.300 align:middle line:84%
they can go to that big, fat
1200-page tome you wrote.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:56.790 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Which I haven't even
opened since it was done.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were carried away.

00:50:59.505 --> 00:51:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They told me I could
do whatever I wanted, so I did.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, so you had
your choice on that.

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Then they
assigned me a little book.

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:07.258 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
little book, though,

00:51:07.258 --> 00:51:08.890 align:middle line:84%
is so cute, and so
well-produced, too.

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:09.690 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, it is.

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.470 align:middle line:90%
It's adorable.

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:12.697 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the third chakra

00:51:12.697 --> 00:51:13.530 align:middle line:90%
all the way through.

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So third chakra,
solar plexus region.

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So front side regulates
mentality, consciousness

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:22.040 align:middle line:84%
that has to do
with our opinions,

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.790 align:middle line:84%
judgments, and what
we're going to pick up

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:27.170 align:middle line:84%
from other people around
their opinions and judgments.

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Back side is going to be able to
very strongly bring in energies

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.300 align:middle line:90%
that help empower us.

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a power energy center.

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So it has a lot to do
with our personal power.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Based on what we believe
about our personal power--

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.410 align:middle line:90%


00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:47.220 align:middle line:84%
each of these chakras really
activates at a certain age.

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.190 align:middle line:84%
This one activates between
2 and 1/2 and 4 and 1/2.

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So to some extent, based on
what we got by with or not

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.030 align:middle line:84%
in those years, that's
going to give us

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.010 align:middle line:84%
a sense of our personal
power, and we're

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:01.680 align:middle line:84%
going to act it
out positionally.

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.870 align:middle line:84%
This energy center
is also in charge

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:05.280 align:middle line:90%
of all the digestive organs.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It locks into the pancreas, the
vertebrae right in that area.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.970 align:middle line:84%
It's really a busy,
busy, busy chakra.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And each of the organs
within that sort of plate--

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.930 align:middle line:84%
we've got not just the pancreas;
the stomach, the spleen,

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.840 align:middle line:84%
the liver, the gallbladder,
part of the esophagus,

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.770 align:middle line:90%
part of the kidney.

00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:25.694 align:middle line:84%
They're also going to have
their own jobs to do, too.

00:52:25.694 --> 00:52:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can see how you can
just spend your whole life just

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:29.320 align:middle line:90%
doing one chakra, too.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So once you start really
working with the chakras, what

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:37.230 align:middle line:84%
you find is you
need to really face

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:41.220 align:middle line:84%
those negative, dysfunctional
beliefs, which all come down

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:44.880 align:middle line:90%
to, I am separate from whatever.

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I am separate, or
I am connected.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So from my point of view,
this is the home where

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:53.260 align:middle line:84%
we have to decide, am
I part of everything,

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:56.260 align:middle line:84%
am I interconnected,
or am I separate?

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:59.025 align:middle line:84%
And if you go separate, you're
going to have some version of I

00:52:59.025 --> 00:53:02.970 align:middle line:84%
am bad, I am evil, I have
no value, I am unworthy.

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And everything's going
to just stink from there.

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:07.174 align:middle line:90%
And it's just not going to work.

00:53:07.174 --> 00:53:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Your feelings aren't
going to be very healthy,

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:12.630 align:middle line:84%
your responses,
your relationships--

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:15.330 align:middle line:90%
very critical energy center.

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So again, if you're on
the very inside of it,

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:19.440 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be sort of clear.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But when you bring in that
astral coloration, it's yellow.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.540 align:middle line:90%
And yellow is happy.

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:25.707 align:middle line:90%
I like happy.

00:53:25.707 --> 00:53:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's optimistic.

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:27.789 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's optimistic.

00:53:27.789 --> 00:53:29.250 align:middle line:90%
It's cheery.

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
elements depending

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.740 align:middle line:84%
on what system you work with
associated with this energy

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.610 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I often affiliate it
with air, which to me is

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:39.620 align:middle line:90%
a really happy element.

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.420 align:middle line:90%
I love air.

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Sort of like flying around,
getting happy ideas,

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.680 align:middle line:90%
playing at that level.

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.410 align:middle line:84%
It's also very
connected to wood.

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And many cultures affiliate
chakras with elements.

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So in my way of looking
at the third chakra,

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I affiliate with air, which
is to me the happiest.

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm a very air person.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.970 align:middle line:10%
That has to do with freedom,
flying around, getting

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:05.430 align:middle line:10%
new ideas, thinking--

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:07.950 align:middle line:10%
not lower stuff, not
unhappy thoughts,

00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:12.030 align:middle line:10%
just sort of cool facts and
data that you can work with.

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Many systems also
affiliate it with wood,

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.900 align:middle line:84%
which is a cheery element,
which is about buoyancy and new

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.850 align:middle line:90%
growth and vision.

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So we've hardly
scratched the surface,

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and you can see everything
to do with the third chakra.

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:27.520 align:middle line:84%
We've hardly
scratched the surface,

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and you can see how
you can even start

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:31.870 align:middle line:90%
working with your third chakra.

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So this brings up
some questions.

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
most people are feeling

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:41.130 align:middle line:84%
is the world is insane,
and they feel disempowered.

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:43.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like, god, I feel
like my power is just

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:44.900 align:middle line:90%
dissipating from my own being.

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:45.774 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Third chakra.

00:54:45.774 --> 00:54:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Third chakra, right.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.140 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
accompanies that

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:54.600 align:middle line:84%
is almost epidemic of digestive
disorders of every kind.

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.685 align:middle line:90%
You go to a dinner party.

00:54:55.685 --> 00:54:57.690 align:middle line:84%
You used to go to
grandma's house,

00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and everybody
could eat the food.

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, someone can't eat
anything in this category

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:03.270 align:middle line:90%
with cellulose.

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:04.920 align:middle line:90%
Someone can't eat gluten.

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Someone can't digest fats.

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:10.080 align:middle line:84%
You can't really have
a dinner party anymore

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.220 align:middle line:90%
that serves everybody.

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You can't.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:12.650 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:14.440 align:middle line:84%
It almost has to be
bring your own dinner.

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bring your own dinner.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So how would you
talk to us about that

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.170 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of
the third chakra?

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And how would you begin--

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:27.150 align:middle line:84%
give us an exercise to
start empowering and then

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:29.229 align:middle line:84%
soothing and putting
things back in alignment

00:55:29.229 --> 00:55:30.270 align:middle line:90%
through the third chakra.

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, it is the
center of personal power

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.950 align:middle line:90%
and over the centuries.

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But especially over
the last few decades,

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:41.160 align:middle line:84%
people have been told that they
need to give their power away

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:45.900 align:middle line:84%
to leaders, to institutions,
to the law, to the government,

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.610 align:middle line:90%
to religion, to whatever it is.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the true
nature of the conflict,

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:53.480 align:middle line:90%
is who's in charge of us.

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I was raised to
give my power away, especially

00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:58.620 align:middle line:90%
as a woman.

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:00.540 align:middle line:90%
But we all have something.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:01.952 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And a Lutheran.

00:56:01.952 --> 00:56:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: And a Lutheran.

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The sinner.

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Always a sinner.

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:07.650 align:middle line:90%
You got to have Jesus.

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're indoctrinated
at some level

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:13.950 align:middle line:84%
with that what we don't have
enough, so that tells us,

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:17.190 align:middle line:84%
instructs us that we need
to pay attention to whatever

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and whoever is in
positional power.

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.580 align:middle line:90%
So we're seeing the crisis.

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And scientists are even proving
that many, many diseases

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.726 align:middle line:84%
actually come from
the digestive system.

00:56:26.726 --> 00:56:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They crawl.

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Microbes crawl up the
vagus nerve into the brain.

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Now you have mental illness,
Parkinson's, OCD, Alzheimer's.

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So we have to pay attention
to our personal sense of self.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.330 align:middle line:84%
In the end, that's
all that counts.

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:45.750 align:middle line:84%
The legends are always
about honor, courage.

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:49.860 align:middle line:84%
These are the kind of
nutrients that I think we need

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.317 align:middle line:90%
to bring into our third chakra.

00:56:51.317 --> 00:56:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So give
us a little exercise

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:55.450 align:middle line:84%
that you really like,
having honor and courage.

00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So we've already talked about
how to work with the back side

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.850 align:middle line:90%
chakras, so let's do this.

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's each of us just affirm
our own spirit, the helping

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:08.100 align:middle line:90%
spirits, the greater spirit.

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:10.380 align:middle line:84%
We ask for the healing
streams of grace

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:13.450 align:middle line:84%
to be provided that
we need to bring

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:17.970 align:middle line:84%
into us the spiritual
qualities each of us

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:23.160 align:middle line:84%
individually require through the
back side of the third chakra.

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So whether that be honor,
courage, self-respect, truth,

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:33.900 align:middle line:84%
knowing, awareness,
whatever it is any of us

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:39.330 align:middle line:84%
need is now streaming into us,
through us, through the back,

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:42.540 align:middle line:84%
saturating those
organs, shifting

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the dysfunctional beliefs,
calming the inflamed feelings,

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.980 align:middle line:84%
changing our digestive
system, but more importantly

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:56.490 align:middle line:84%
spiritualizing
that energy center.

00:57:56.490 --> 00:58:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So it now emanates from
it into the world what we

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.580 align:middle line:90%
need to share with the world.

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:05.130 align:middle line:84%
It instructs the
world how to treat us

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:10.080 align:middle line:84%
with honor, with grace,
with truths, with respect.

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's all we are
going to now tolerate

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:15.160 align:middle line:84%
when we have the
power to do that,

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and that's all we're going
to give to the world as well.

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So something as simple as
what we just did people

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:25.260 align:middle line:84%
can do for any topic,
any time of the day.

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.097 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all of
this is covered in your--

00:58:28.097 --> 00:58:29.430 align:middle line:90%
how many books have you written?

00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: 25, I think.

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 25.

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:31.886 align:middle line:90%
I was going to say 23.

00:58:31.886 --> 00:58:32.960 align:middle line:90%
25.

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You're
probably more accurate.

00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:35.893 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're prolific.

00:58:35.893 --> 00:58:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I have two
going, so I add them in.

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyway, like I
said, even if you just pick up

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.339 align:middle line:84%
your little, Llewellyn's
Little Book of Chakras--

00:58:44.339 --> 00:58:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's got a
lot of data in it.

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.296 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has a lot of data
and a lot of practical use,

00:58:48.296 --> 00:58:50.164 align:middle line:84%
and it's just the
cutest little book.

00:58:50.164 --> 00:58:51.080 align:middle line:90%
I just love that book.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:52.170 align:middle line:10%
I love it.

00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:53.190 align:middle line:10%
It is pocket size.

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:54.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It is pocket size.

00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:58.030 align:middle line:10%
And then if you really want to
dig in, your tome is brilliant.

00:58:58.030 --> 00:58:58.830 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: It's good.
