>>REGINA MEREDITH: The notion
of graduating from college

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:10%
with a degree in philosophy
has become a joke.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Everyone will tell you it's
the fastest track to poverty.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:84%
But just imagine,
for a moment, a world

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:90%
without the great thinkers.

What would life on
Earth look like?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would
argue that you only

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:84%
need to go to the closest
mall for that answer.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that very
scenario will be

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%

Neil Kramer is a modern day
philosopher and esotericist.

His breadth of understanding
is vast and deep.

one of the primary challenges

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:90%
of being human.

I think everybody watching
this will probably

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
want to know the
trick to that one.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:90%

>>NEIL KRAMER: No.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:90%
It isn't a trick.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:90%
It's an art form.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's an art form.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And let's start out, because
we're going to-- I'll

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:84%
lead into this in
a minute, but let's

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
talk about the nature of
this ritualistic, almost

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of zombie-like life that
the vast majority of humanity

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:90%
is participating in.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: A good
visual metaphor for it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:10%
is to say that a lot
routines and patterns in life

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:10%
are kind of like train tracks.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:10%
And there's various stops
on the subway, as it were.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.540 align:middle line:10%
And people become
accustomed to those

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:10%
and they regard many stops
on the subway as choice.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
As free will,
forgetting the fact

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
that they are actually
all predetermined.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
all in the sa--

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
they're going the
same line every day.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: To the
same line every day.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:90%
You get on it.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:90%
You do this.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:90%
You do this.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:90%
You do this.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.510 align:middle line:84%
That choice is
mistaken for free will.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Different thing.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.635 align:middle line:84%
So there's a great
understanding in the mysticism

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to talk to
you about today in that that

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:84%
has to be disposed of
as fast as possible,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
which means getting
off the tracks.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Which is a very unsettling
and disturbing business

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So part of my role, self
avowed and self proclaimed,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:84%
is to try and make that
achievable and approachable.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And say, only, in fact,
by getting off the rails,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.010 align:middle line:84%
getting off the tracks,
can you do anything.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise it's too inconsistent.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
feel that there has

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:84%
to be a moment of
shaking, or awakening,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:84%
or disruption in
one's life to create

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.812 align:middle line:84%
the necessity for
breaking patterns?

00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah, either a de--

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:90%
We'll stress the metaphor.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Either a derailment
or such soul numbing

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
repetition that
typically at the age--

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's too
painful to go on.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You have a midlife crisis,
whether it's at 25 or 55,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and you think, why
am I doing this?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
brings me fulfillment?

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it aligned with my growth?

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.061 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that
I'm supposed to do?

00:03:11.061 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And is anyone holding a
gun to your head saying,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:90%
you must do this?

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.545 align:middle line:84%
And it's typically something
that people suppress.

00:03:16.545 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And culture asks us
to suppress that.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So my view is that
I agree with you.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:90%
It usually takes something.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But then it requires a great
fortitude, which we'll come to,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:90%
to actually sustain that.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.472 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone has moments
of epiphany and realization,

00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:84%
but then it goes away
and you're back on track.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then it actually
has to be a choice point.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we're
going to show in a minute

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.413 align:middle line:84%
is-- we're going to
show a video in a minute

00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:84%
because it is so illustrative
of how we live our lives

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:90%
and how we're influenced.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And you have watched
the illusionist-- Is he

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:84%
called an illusionist,
Derren Brown?

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An illusionist,
for lack of a better word.

00:03:55.696 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I think, last I heard,
28 million people a week

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:90%
watch his shows in England.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And the man is
incredibly masterful.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And what is it--
why did you start

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:84%
studying-- kind of
studying his ways

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and watching what
he's doing by way

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.112 align:middle line:90%
of manipulating the populace?

00:04:13.112 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Well, it's
a classic technique,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:84%
which is you choose something
safe, that's entertaining,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate a very
big, profound principle.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So this guy has entertainment
shows in England.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And wider UK, Scotland,
Europe-- all over the place.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Now in America.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And he takes the principal
of the train track,

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and he introduces a moment of
confusion to reroute somebody.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So you know, like on the
track, you have the switches.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And he knows when
someone's approaching that,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:90%
and he pulls the switch on them.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And predetermines where
they're going to go.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%
To the viewer, it looks
like mind control.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:90%
And in a very real way, it is.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So he introduces a whole new
generation of 20, and 30,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and 40 and 50-year olds
to real life mind control.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's notable how,
when you take that out

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:84%
of the guy's skill
in entertainment,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and apply it to
the television, you

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
realize the same thing
is being done there

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:84%
as it is in the
universities and colleges.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:90%
In the home.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:90%
In the elementary school.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:90%
In the workplace.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.490 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
They are doing a
Derren Brown on you.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So understanding
the mechanism makes

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:90%
it harder to be controlled.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And it is the modern
version of it.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy from--
Milton Erickson--

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:84%
there's other people in the past
who he's developing their work.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.365 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he wouldn't
mind others knowing that.

00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But he's the contemporary
practitioner.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think people
are going to enjoy

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:90%
the clip you're going to show.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:90%

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's go ahead and take
a look at this clip.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.253 align:middle line:84%
And I bring it up
because this happens

00:05:48.253 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:84%
at a mall, which is
why I brought that up

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.990 align:middle line:90%
in the introduction to you.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.014 align:middle line:90%

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:90%
some very special offers today.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Details of our
special offers can

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
be found handily
by the elevators.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So why not come right on
up and see for yourselves.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Our special offers will only
be available for a short period

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So all those customers
wishing to reach up and grab

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:84%
this exciting opportunity,
should do so now.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.752 align:middle line:84%
-I don't know, like,
everybody raised their hand.

00:07:14.752 --> 00:07:16.584 align:middle line:84%
It was just weird because
I'm walking around

00:07:16.584 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:90%
and he's like, now.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.265 align:middle line:90%
And everybody raised their hand.

00:07:19.265 --> 00:07:20.098 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:20.098 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Gosh.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
shot from above,

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:84%
watching everybody just
walking, and all the hands

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:90%
go up simultaneously.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.149 align:middle line:84%
What does that illustrate
to you about us?

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: People can't
operate without a program.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:90%
They have no will of their own.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And he's imposing his will
through the instruction

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:90%
of English language.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So of you listen carefully
to what he's saying,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.007 align:middle line:84%
he's embedding instructions
into a disorientating syntax.

00:07:45.007 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.881 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: And kind of language.

00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So he's telling people what
to do through a language that

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:90%
is kind of subliminal.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And in that liminal space, there
is an instruction that says,

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
to put your hand up

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to do it.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So he imposes a strong will
on people with no will,

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:84%
or a very weak will, which
is most people, as we'll

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:90%
come to discuss.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's a safe, and funny, and
entertaining way of doing it.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But if you extrapolate that out
to culture, it's far from safe.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's far from benign.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And you realize
that that is what's

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.685 align:middle line:84%
going on with all
the media and all

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:90%
the educational institutions.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.325 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to deny that.

00:08:26.325 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you notice
there are very few people that

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
didn't succumb to
that suggestion.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:30.965 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:08:30.965 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
Older people,
typically, won't do it

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
because they're more
resilient in a way.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:90%
And very young people.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing from,
sort of, 20 to 50, whoosh.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:90%
Up.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So now they had
listened to his voice

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.862 align:middle line:84%
for a while with innocuous
messages prior to that.

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Although he was
already starting to

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.156 align:middle line:84%
embed disorienting
information in them.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.238 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so they become
used to the tone of his voice.

00:08:54.238 --> 00:08:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So by this kind of time, it's
kind of background noise,

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.630 align:middle line:84%
by the time he offers
his final suggestion.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
How does this relate to the
day to day life in the media,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.112 align:middle line:84%
for example, that
we're involved with?

00:09:05.112 --> 00:09:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's a
very simple thing,

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:84%
which is, that it's
just a bit of fun.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's harmless.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.536 align:middle line:90%
And it's just entertainment.

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can always
choose to turn it off.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.643 align:middle line:84%
And so when people are telling
you about your groceries,

00:09:14.643 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and about clothes,
and about technology,

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and the new smartphone
or whatever, you think,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:90%
oh well, it's just stuff.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:84%
But that voice then shifts its
pitch, as it were, its aspect,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and starts to tell
you what to do.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So that very same
voice that was telling

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
you about, you know whatever,
some sort of whole grain rice,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:84%
will then be telling
you what it's

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.360 align:middle line:84%
acceptable to do racially,
ethically, and morally.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And the week after, and
we learn to accept that.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's embedded
in the culture.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And as Terence
McKenna used to say,

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm happy to
quote him, culture

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
is not your friend
in that respect.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about human culture.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
mainstream, what

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I call machine culture,
which is all about circuits,

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.990 align:middle line:90%
and patterns, and routines.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
introduce confusion,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:84%
then you get this
effect, where people

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:90%
will do what they're told.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So the confusion
is the moment where

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
you introduce this, what's known
as a transderivational search.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.410 align:middle line:90%
So the brain goes, what?

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And then at that moment, you
can come in and impose your will

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:90%
on that individual.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:84%
On a mass scale, 6
billion people, easy.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happens when you're

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:84%
giving a perpetual
message of trauma out,

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.850 align:middle line:90%
say on the evening news?

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:90%
BBC.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:90%
BBC America.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.579 align:middle line:90%
NPR.

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
All the way through the
networks in this country.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:90%
CNN.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Constant trauma.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Well, as many
of your viewers, I'm sure,

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:84%
will be aware, trauma
fragments mind,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and it brings focus into a
state of, what you might say,

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:90%
blurriness.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And it destroys a
person's ability to focus.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And it erodes a person's
sense of equilibrium

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.672 align:middle line:90%
in the human story.

00:11:00.672 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
In what we do and
what we don't do.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And the good things we do
and the bad things we do.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So you lose your
point of balance.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But even more
significant than that

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
is that the trauma that it
introduces to the individual

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.335 align:middle line:84%
introduces a sort of
self defeating attitude,

00:11:17.335 --> 00:11:19.630 align:middle line:84%
a sort of resignation,
where you think,

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.924 align:middle line:90%
well, the world's screwed.

00:11:21.924 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:84%
We'll just-- we'll do
the best we can and hope

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.680 align:middle line:84%
that our soldiers do this,
and our politicians do this.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And fingers crossed
it might be OK.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.654 align:middle line:84%
If big daddy in DC
makes everything OK.

00:11:32.654 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Whoever that is.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Or big mommy, could
well be in 2016.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
It's an old story but,
in watching the news,

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
you create a situation where
you dis-empower yourself

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:90%
from normal human equilibrium.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:84%
The news cannot tell you
what's going on in the world.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.040 align:middle line:90%
You can only do that yourself.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
It cannot tell you anything
of relevance because it

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know you.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So your particular
portal, if you like,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:84%
your window into
what is meaningful

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
can only be determined
by yourself.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But if you're already resigned
to a world that has gone wrong,

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and broken beyond repair,
you don't want to do that.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.075 align:middle line:90%
You just want a new watch.

00:12:12.075 --> 00:12:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know
you have strong feelings

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:90%
about social media.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.370 align:middle line:84%
What about being programmed
with social media?

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.886 align:middle line:90%
Via social media now.

00:12:19.886 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Fragmentation
is the keyword.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.827 align:middle line:84%
Social media takes
you away from will.

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From will.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: From will.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:90%
We'll come to that.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I say that, but I know that
from what we said earlier,

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
we will focus on
that a little bit.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we are,
in just a moment here.

00:12:34.325 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:84%
The will of a human being
is the greatest gift

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
that is given, in my
view, to all of us.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
It has a human,
flesh, animal aspect

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:84%
which is very organic
and beautiful.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Very creative, very dynamic.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And it has a divine,
higher being aspect,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:90%
which is very esoteric.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is completely
deactivated by Facebook,

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and Twitter, and
Pinterest, and StumbleUpon,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.530 align:middle line:90%
and all those such things.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Because it introduces
fragmentation.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And it introduces the
idea that the collective

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:90%
is the diktat of will.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's a sort of funny
thing to say that.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:84%
But it means that
collectivist philosophy, that

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:84%
is group goals over
individual goals, rules.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is underpinned
by the number of likes,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
the number of
StumbleUpons, and all that.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So all those little
funny things--

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:90%
How many friends have you got?

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:84%
How many people like
this thing that you did?

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:84%
--is very carefully engineered
to introduce the power

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.641 align:middle line:90%
of the collective being--

00:13:38.641 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
culture really dominates.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Dominant
over the individual.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So it
makes life worse.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Social media makes life worse.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And it disconnects
us from each other.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about this
incredible addictive quality it

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:90%
has over people's lives?

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: The fragmented mind
is addicted to sensation.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you're constantly
waiting for your smartphone

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.120 align:middle line:84%
to buzz in your pocket, for
a new ping from something

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:84%
from the outside, it's
like a little tiny shot

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.307 align:middle line:90%
of meth or whatever.

00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep
having a little one.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:16.598 align:middle line:90%
And a little one.

00:14:16.598 --> 00:14:17.519 align:middle line:90%
And a little one.

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And, on its own,
you can't see, well,

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:90%
how is that doing us any harm?

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, cumulatively,
is has the effect

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:84%
of creating a dependency on
an outside technology, which

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.740 align:middle line:84%
is in the hands of
people who lack,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:90%
in my view, spiritual wisdom.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Always something to
be cautious of, that.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.342 align:middle line:84%
So the technology in itself,
of course, is neutral.

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Um-hmm.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: But its framework
and its positioning

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:84%
has to be understood,
that only you

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:90%
can determine the value of that.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
No one else can
tell you about that.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.204 align:middle line:84%
Bill Gates or Mark
Zuckerberg, they don't know.

00:14:49.204 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Someone else is telling
them what to do.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be very
disciplined, and very

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.330 align:middle line:84%
insistent, on using
the technology.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:84%
When you want to transmit a
message, use the technology.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:90%
When you're not, turn it off.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there becomes
this, beyond addictive quality,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.950 align:middle line:84%
this anxiety that
happens, where people that

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
are waiting for
their message tone.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:84%
They're waiting for
hive acknowledgment,

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:90%
is what I call it.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: So it's
hive acceptance,

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
hive acknowledgment,
hive participation.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Hive- H-I-V-E. And to be
separate from that, I mean,

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
children in high schools across
America are killing themselves

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.060 align:middle line:84%
because they're not accepted
by the hive of social media.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Literally killing themselves.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Japan has a big problem
with that, in particular,

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.480 align:middle line:84%
because of its hierarchical
traditional society.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And it moves people away from
the spontaneous living moment

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.060 align:middle line:84%
into a retrospective
view of life,

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
where you're always looking
at what's just occurred,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:90%
not what is.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so if you
find yourself kind of, even

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
subliminally, anxiously waiting
to hear your particular text

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:84%
tone, then that's
a really good clue

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.882 align:middle line:84%
that you are now
in hive mentality.

00:16:08.882 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You're
in hive mentality.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.090 align:middle line:90%
You're out off balance.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.381 align:middle line:90%
You're not being a human being.

00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:16.410 align:middle line:84%
You're a conduit for
someone else's reality.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:84%
All of us will do
that a little bit.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But the technology
increases the likelihood

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:27.530 align:middle line:84%
of that beginning to form
your habits and routines.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:90%
So it has to be turned off.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
It physically has
to be turned off.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.934 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is really
more just reflexive living.

00:16:35.934 --> 00:16:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about will--

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.185 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Sure.

00:16:38.185 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and what
will is in your parlance.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Not the normal
definition of will,

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.797 align:middle line:84%
but in deep, esoteric
definitions of will.

00:16:44.797 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Well, let's look
at both of them side by side.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Will-- common understanding
of will is-- Traditionally,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
if we go back to the 1820s,
Noah Webster's dictionary --

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.820 align:middle line:84%
a good thing to do to see
language in a purer form than

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.290 align:middle line:90%
it is today.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:04.595 align:middle line:84%
Will is to either engage with
something fully and do it.

00:17:04.595 --> 00:17:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Pursue it.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:90%
And attach to something.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:90%
Or to forbear something.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.710 align:middle line:90%
And detach from something.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:90%
And to make that decision.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.154 align:middle line:84%
So the will in the
Classical sense,

00:17:16.154 --> 00:17:18.712 align:middle line:84%
of having the resolution
to be a world class--

00:17:18.712 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's like an
enforced choice point.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.086 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --a world
class pianist.

00:17:22.086 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do that without will.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:90%
A violinist or painter.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do that without will.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
The other side of
it, the forbearance,

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:84%
is Patrick McGuinn,
the prisoner.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
If you are in a kind
of incarceration,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
you can forbear it
with will, where

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:90%
here, no one can touch you.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.235 align:middle line:84%
And they can do whatever,
but they can't touch you.

00:17:40.235 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:90%
We know many examples of that.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great power.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And it emanates from
the individual's,

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
as I say, fortitude and
resolution and shear

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:90%
force of mental acuity.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric
understanding of will

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:84%
adds a wholly different
thing to this,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:84%
which is to say
that will, all will,

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
is the will of the
whole of creation

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and its determination to
evolve and refine itself.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And to exercise will is to
contribute and participate

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.710 align:middle line:90%
in that wholeness.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So the beauty of it
is that you become

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.570 align:middle line:90%
a conduit for universal will.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:90%
You may say divine will.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:90%
I like to say it like that.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.420 align:middle line:84%
But also, crucially,
it is shaped

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:32.190 align:middle line:84%
by the individual's
individual expression of life.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Their free will to
determine for themselves

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:90%
what they want to do.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:90%
So will likes that.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't want an empty vessel.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:84%
It wants a vessel with
character, and skill,

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and a voice, and strength,
and passion, and power,

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:90%
and all those good things.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's the marriage of the
real unity of consciousness.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.880 align:middle line:84%
The word, the logos, firing
out through the universe,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
the algorithm of
creation, saying

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:90%
participate in this with me.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not a finished
work, creation.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not done.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:90%
It's still happening.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a constant
process of refinement.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's still
unfolding, as it were.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.341 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:19:12.341 --> 00:19:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And in that respect,
when you join in with that,

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:84%
that's the first time when
the universe can see you.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.585 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that,
you're just a body.

00:19:20.585 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:90%
You're just a person.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Good luck.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.220 align:middle line:90%
But it's roulette.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:90%
You're just playing.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:90%
It's random.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
When you participate in
creation, in making refinements

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:84%
to what is this, the
universe can see you.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And rather than being the vague
opponent that it is for many,

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a very definite ally.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So only by walking the
spiritual path can that happen.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Christians used to say that
only by accepting divinity

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:90%
can God see you.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.727 align:middle line:84%
So only by accepting
the Savior within,

00:19:53.727 --> 00:19:56.060 align:middle line:84%
which they would call Christ
and we would say is perhaps

00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:84%
ourselves-- same thing in
some esoteric Christianity--

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:90%
can you be known by the divine.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Unless you do that,
he can't see you.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Calling him a he.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.134 align:middle line:90%
He can't see you.

00:20:08.134 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:90%
So you're on your own.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:90%
You are far away.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:84%
When you participate in creation
through the exercise of will,

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
through the emanation
of will, you

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.950 align:middle line:84%
can be you and the
divine at the same time.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So it has a very practical
level and a very esoteric level.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Technology destroys all of that
and completely deactivates it

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:90%
and just turns us into robots.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
beautiful description.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for sharing
those definitions.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And now if we juxtapose
that to a lot of-- and

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not bashing it-- because
I've been part of it.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of my
shows are part of it,

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:48.250 align:middle line:84%
or would be perceived as part
of it, but new age thinking.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.272 align:middle line:84%
And my life has been steeped
in it over the last 30 years.

00:20:51.272 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone through my
own progression, which

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:90%
is, to a large extent, this, oh.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Just go with the flow.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Just go with the flow.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Spirit will tell me what to do.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And this whole
notion that you're

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:84%
going to be informed
what you're to do

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:84%
by spirit or someone
passing by or the universe,

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:90%
and just flow with it.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:84%
It really sounds like it's
the antithesis of what you're

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:90%
talking about in a lot of ways.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.225 align:middle line:84%
New age philosophy
is stuck in a sort

00:21:19.225 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:84%
of perpetual, adolescent
loop by design,

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
in my view, in that, for
beginners, it's kind of-- it's

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a safe harbor to talk to
people about things and express

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:84%
a part of yourself that you
cannot do in the mainstream.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.279 align:middle line:84%
But when you become an
intermediate student,

00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:84%
as it were, an advanced,
student there's nothing there.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Nothing at all there.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of going with the
flow, and spirit will guide me,

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.335 align:middle line:90%
is nonsense.

00:21:45.335 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:84%
It is massive
bollocks, if I may say.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It really doesn't work.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.071 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because will
cannot see what spirit cannot

00:21:55.071 --> 00:21:55.570 align:middle line:90%
see.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not exercising
will, spirit cannot see you.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.920 align:middle line:90%
It cannot guide you.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.060 align:middle line:90%
It cannot embrace you.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:90%
The hand of God is not with you.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:84%
It needs you to try,
let's say, that 51%.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.320 align:middle line:84%
If you exercise your will
just over the halfway mark,

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
then the universe says,
now I believe you.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:90%
But that begins with mind.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:90%
And then heart.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:90%
And then will.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And these things must
flow in that order.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.690 align:middle line:84%
If you are heart
led, you are heading

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
for being under a
bridge, with a bottle

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:90%
of whisky in a brown paper bag.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If you're heart led.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:29.843 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Heart led.

00:22:29.843 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Disaster.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain that.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.072 align:middle line:84%
Explain that hierarchy
of mind, heart,

00:22:34.072 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and then I think solar plexus
is what you're talking about.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Mind.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.879 align:middle line:84%
This comes from my Classical,
mystical, heritage.

00:22:40.879 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk
about that for a moment,

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:90%
even before it precedes it.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:84%
One of things you and I are
both very appreciative of

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:90%
is the hermetic tradition.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yes.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.143 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
hermetic traditions,

00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:53.742 align:middle line:84%
as we were talking
off camera, it's

00:22:53.742 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
as though, if you're
going to speak

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:84%
these other esoteric
languages, if you're

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.630 align:middle line:84%
going to speak a language,
then, if you understand Latin,

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:84%
you have the basis
for many languages.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And you had likened Hermeticism
to a basis for understanding

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:90%
many other wisdom traditions.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:09.735 align:middle line:84%
You're stealing
my analogy there,

00:23:09.735 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:90%
but I'll let you have that one.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh. [LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.246 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It is.

00:23:12.246 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely is.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.831 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
understand English,

00:23:15.831 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:84%
you need to understand Latin,
because not only does it

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:84%
show you the word construction,
but how word meanings change.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.600 align:middle line:90%
So you have all these offshoots.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.040 align:middle line:90%
American slang and vernacular.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.060 align:middle line:90%
And German and French.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:28.976 align:middle line:90%
And all these Spanish.

00:23:28.976 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:90%
All these different things.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:84%
The Latin influence
is very important.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.515 align:middle line:84%
And, as you rightly say,
Hermeticism, for me,

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:38.070 align:middle line:90%
can be likened to that.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And although its origins
are very uncertain,

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:84%
because of its oral
tradition of transmission,

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle line:84%
rather than its
textual transmission--

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:84%
there's very little
written down.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Rather like Druidism,
in that respect.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:90%
There are no books on Druidism.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Not one.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:84%
The short, concise Oxford
book of Druidism is rubbish.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Massively rubbish.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.599 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:02.890 align:middle line:84%
There isn't anything, it's
a little bit of archaeology.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And the guy says, look,
we don't really know.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:90%
We don't actually know.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
That's always a good
sign to me, because it

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:84%
means that the transmission
is from man to man.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Woman to woman.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:84%
It's from only those
who have chosen

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.300 align:middle line:84%
to go through the
path of initiation.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I am
very results driven.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested in mystery
for the sake of mystery.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't care less.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:90%
What I look at is what works.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And hermetic philosophy,
through things like theosophy,

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and anthroposophy,
and Rosicrucianism--

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:84%
even old Golden Dawn stuff and
all the offshoots of that--

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And the principles of
that are very human.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great emphasis
on individual achievement

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and extraordinary discipline.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Which is absolutely missing
in the New Age paradigm.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So hermetic traditions
can only be transmitted

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:05.700 align:middle line:84%
from a hermetic master-- or you
might say mistress these days,

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:90%
as well-- to a hermetic student.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And not all hermetic masters
are hermetic students.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a lifelong process
that you go through.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So that informs some of the
things that I've learned.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And one hermetic
tenant is to say,

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Hermeticism seeks development.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.070 align:middle line:84%
All wisdom wants
to be developed.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, the wisdom itself
seeks development.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Who will develop me?

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Who will take this sculpture
and make it more beautiful?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a finished work.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's something that
says, here are some good roots.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Some good foundations.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.191 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to repeat these.

00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:90%
They are done.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:84%
However, you have something
unique to add to this.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:84%
We'd love you to
contribute to this project.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's very healthy.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.829 align:middle line:84%
And it demands discipline
in the individual.

00:25:58.829 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're not disciplined,
you can't do it.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.930 align:middle line:90%
And that begins with mind.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.480 align:middle line:84%
If you cannot exercise
your intellect, forget it.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Because there will
be no chance of you

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:84%
sustaining your
spiritual growth.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:84%
There is no growth
without discipline.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:90%
Discipline brings power.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Discipline is your friend.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So rather than it being
some hierarchical thing,

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.090 align:middle line:90%
you will do this.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:90%
You will listen to this.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:90%
It's always self discipline.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And bowing to the truth of that
wisdom within in the same way

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:84%
that a wise student
would bow to a sensei,

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:84%
teaching martial
arts, because of

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.320 align:middle line:84%
the demonstrable
physical wisdom embodied.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:39.962 align:middle line:90%
Not knowledge.

00:26:39.962 --> 00:26:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Forget knowledge.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Not interested.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.439 align:middle line:90%
Forget data.

00:26:42.439 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Forget information.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Not interested.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Embodied wisdom is
all that matters.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:90%
The mystic knows that.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
The scholar doesn't
know that, necessarily.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:84%
He may talk about it,
but he might not do it.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Important that.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Some do.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Some don't.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:10%
The mystic is not able to
profess any mystical wisdom

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.842 align:middle line:10%
or maturation without
self discipline.

00:27:05.842 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And that makes all
the difference for me.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.450 align:middle line:90%
So this brings discipline.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.099 align:middle line:90%
It focuses will.

00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:11.890 align:middle line:90%
That's all it does.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:90%
It focuses will.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.380 align:middle line:84%
To be able to say, can
you adjust that lens

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.345 align:middle line:84%
to make that sun burn
through that leaf.

00:27:19.345 --> 00:27:20.095 align:middle line:90%
That's discipline.

00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:84%
If you can't, it's too
diffuse, right, the light?

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.447 align:middle line:84%
Heart is your means
of connection, right?

00:27:27.447 --> 00:27:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
love and all that stuff.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a nice byproduct.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Love is connection.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It's two energy systems meeting
and saying, you know what?

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:84%
We're not really
bounded individually.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.330 align:middle line:90%
We can merge.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to make love
with a person, classic example.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.770 align:middle line:84%
If you are to be
intimate intellectually

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:90%
with a person, classic example.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is your faculty
for merging with something,

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:84%
for two systems to
recognize their consonance.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.500 align:middle line:90%
I.e.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.750 align:middle line:84%
they're not individual
systems; they're one thing.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, the wave
particle duality

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that our quantum
friends tell us about

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:90%
is a lovely example of that.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is your reality
modeling, your reason,

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:84%
your rationality,
your discernment.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely critical.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.045 align:middle line:90%
But that's no good without this.

00:28:14.045 --> 00:28:16.040 align:middle line:90%
This is no good without that.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And when this is let
loose without that,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.800 align:middle line:84%
watch what happens to people's
lives who are heart led.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll say nothing.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Think about the people you
know who say, oh, I do that.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Look at their lives.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Look at how they relate with
their friends and family.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Look at their business.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Look at their ability
to organize themselves

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and look after their resources
and manage their life.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It speaks for itself.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet, human beings prize, so
highly, the emotional nature.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But what you're talking about is
essentially an emotional nature

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have
higher guidance.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Emotional
nature on its own

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:90%
is the emotion of a coyote.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:01.795 align:middle line:90%
Or an eagle.

00:29:01.795 --> 00:29:02.675 align:middle line:90%
It has a value.

00:29:02.675 --> 00:29:03.555 align:middle line:90%
It is real.

00:29:03.555 --> 00:29:04.945 align:middle line:90%
It is flush.

00:29:04.945 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It always teaches.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But without the higher
being, it is unruly,

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.920 align:middle line:90%
like the emotion of a child.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Hence the, kind of
purposefully, pubescent

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.440 align:middle line:84%
New Age thing keeps
it at that stage.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Maturation is held at
bay because with mind,

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the New Age paradigm
collapses straight away.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are some people
being very vociferous

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.650 align:middle line:84%
about that, which
I like to hear,

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:30.790 align:middle line:90%
having a go at those guys.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.560 align:middle line:90%
It's good that.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Not the individuals.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:34.525 align:middle line:90%
That's not necessary.

00:29:34.525 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't help anybody.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.450 align:middle line:84%
But the principles of
saying, go with the flow.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Spirit guides me.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I'll dance on the
mountaintop in a white dress.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.960 align:middle line:90%
That's really lovely.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But that cannot be
sustained without mind.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So when this is here, then
this, your ability for intimacy,

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:90%
is increased tenfold.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Your ability to know love
is increased 100 fold.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain that
a little more deeply.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.855 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Until mind is honed,
you do not know what you are

00:30:02.855 --> 00:30:03.840 align:middle line:90%
or who you are.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot define
your boundary clearly.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So you do believe
that you're separate.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you go through
this extreme schizophrenia

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.420 align:middle line:90%
of separateness and the hive.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.570 align:middle line:90%
Separateness and the hive.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:24.330 align:middle line:84%
What mind does is it shows you
the true nature of your-- very,

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:84%
very odd word, this but--
multi-dimensionality.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:28.870 align:middle line:90%
I try not to use that word.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:90%
It's very unhelpful these days.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that you can be
in two places at the same time.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:40.726 align:middle line:84%
So in the "Dune"
fictional universe,

00:30:40.726 --> 00:30:42.100 align:middle line:84%
they have a phrase
for this taken

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.590 align:middle line:84%
from Hebrew, which
is kwisatz haderach.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And it means something that is
in two places at the same time,

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:50.165 align:middle line:90%
taken from a Jewish word.

00:30:50.165 --> 00:30:53.600 align:middle line:84%
That is the true
principal of heart.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:84%
That it can be you and
it can be the other thing

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:57.610 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:01.240 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, the
level of intimacy ramps up.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's like having a big
shot of MDMA or ecstasy

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:90%
and just going, shooo.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:07.844 align:middle line:90%
Gosh.

00:31:07.844 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Not that I would know.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.801 align:middle line:90%
Theoretically, obviously.

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's a huge boost
where all the boundaries

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.100 align:middle line:84%
are collapsed but
guided by reason.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:17.450 align:middle line:90%
Guided by intellect.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.799 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Its own principle
of higher mind framework.

00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Again, it's the will.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the laser say you've
got this incredible sun,

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:28.570 align:middle line:84%
this huge solar energy
that we can focus.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you can do it
here, the little girl's

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.840 align:middle line:84%
face in the playground,
the flower that

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.360 align:middle line:84%
comes in the spring, the
look in your father's eyes.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:84%
All those things can be
so intimately connected

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:90%
and contacted.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.945 align:middle line:90%
But only with this.

00:31:41.945 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes
sense because if you

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:84%
don't have any framework,
or any boundaries,

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.890 align:middle line:84%
for knowledge of self--
this is self-- then coming

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.650 align:middle line:84%
from the heart or
emotional level,

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:84%
you're constantly bouncing
off of everything else

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.120 align:middle line:90%
to get some sense of acceptance.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: You are.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:84%
The person without mind is led
by acknowledgement, acceptance,

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.000 align:middle line:84%
issues of self esteem,
issues of validation,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.880 align:middle line:90%
issues of belonging.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.860 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm not perfect, either.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.780 align:middle line:84%
But I have worked hard
on that in myself.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.841 align:middle line:84%
And now it gives me
clarity about what

00:32:15.841 --> 00:32:17.090 align:middle line:90%
other people's challenges are.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And people come to me
privately to address this.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
endemic in society.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to focus on
that negative, as such.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.290 align:middle line:84%
But once you confront
that reality,

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:84%
confront that negative,
then you can say, right.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:32.960 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's because people have
said, look, you're either heart

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:37.360 align:middle line:90%
or you're mind.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Choose which one it is.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Guys, you're the heart.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Girls, you're the mind.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Today.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
It used to be the other
way around, right?

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.723 align:middle line:84%
So now there's an
identity crisis.

00:32:46.723 --> 00:32:47.723 align:middle line:90%
Women think they're men.

00:32:47.723 --> 00:32:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Men think they're women.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And the truth of it is, the
great spiritual secret really,

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:90%
which is an open secret.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.640 align:middle line:84%
It's right in the book that
we have on the shelves.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual human
is androgynous

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:90%
in their use of mind and heart.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.910 align:middle line:84%
It creates a very
healthy androgyny

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:09.630 align:middle line:84%
in that you have the
extraordinary masculine appeal

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and dominance, and
the beautiful feminine

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:90%
yielding and nurturing.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot
proceed without that.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.680 align:middle line:84%
A woman calls that emotional
maturity, which I think

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.550 align:middle line:90%
is good.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of guys
struggle with that

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.830 align:middle line:84%
because we've never
been taught it.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.490 align:middle line:84%
No one ever sat
us down and showed

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:32.070 align:middle line:84%
us the significance
of emotional maturity

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:90%
to your spiritual path.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And yet they are
absolutely critical.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And the people who fall
down, and get it wrong,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:84%
is because they see their
emotions as just something that

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:84%
comes, and happens, and you
don't need to worry about it.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And part of
that emotional maturity

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:90%
involves compassion.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.590 align:middle line:84%
For example, compassion
comes from that.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:56.940 align:middle line:90%
It's born of that.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard to
progress on a spiritual level

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.190 align:middle line:84%
if you can't understand--
if you don't possess

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.486 align:middle line:90%
basic elements of compassion.

00:34:04.486 --> 00:34:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Kwisatz haderach.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:06.540 align:middle line:90%
You have to be both.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.437 align:middle line:90%
You have to be you.

00:34:07.437 --> 00:34:08.145 align:middle line:90%
I have to be you.

00:34:08.145 --> 00:34:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So to know kind of
what you feel now,

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and kind of what you think,
and kind of what you think

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and these people, helps
me communicate better.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.065 align:middle line:84%
So it's a discipline to
say, if you're just you,

00:34:21.065 --> 00:34:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and you're being a
personality, that's very nice.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.449 align:middle line:84%
And it goes down well
in some quarters.

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you can soften
that a bit, and say,

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:90%
I know what we want.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.070 align:middle line:90%
All of us.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.690 align:middle line:90%
I know what we want.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm part of that we.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:39.449 align:middle line:84%
Then you can just
get that point where

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:41.310 align:middle line:90%
you're on the edge of self.

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.219 align:middle line:84%
And you can just open
the gateway and say,

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.060 align:middle line:90%
I know what you want to hear.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And I know what makes a
good piece of communication.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't always get it right,
but I get the feeling of it.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I get the sense of it.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And if we can communicate
that properly,

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.600 align:middle line:84%
we have this wonderful
thing called empathy.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Which, again, is
useless without mind.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.630 align:middle line:90%
With mind, wow.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the best thing ever.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
amidst all of this,

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.130 align:middle line:90%
there is another sort of axiom.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:10.320 align:middle line:84%
If it's easy, if
the path is clear

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and there's no resistance,
then that's for me.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: If it's not hard,
you're doing it wrong.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.160 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual development
in these times

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.310 align:middle line:90%
does not arise by itself, OK?

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It does not.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.780 align:middle line:84%
There are times here,
and there are times here,

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.738 align:middle line:90%
where that's different.

00:35:26.738 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
where we are now.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:34.800 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go forward without
this incredible effort of will.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So, my definition of
a mystic is somebody

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:84%
who looks around at the
world and goes, eh, no.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:43.800 align:middle line:90%
This isn't it.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.770 align:middle line:84%
This is something,
but this isn't it.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
that mystical impulse.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Everyone watching this program
has that mystical impulse.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.050 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
that and a mystic

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:90%
is the mystic says, right.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to devote my
life to the pursuit of that

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and change who I am on a
week by week, month by month,

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:90%
year by year basis.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And say goodbye to
being Regina and Neal.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:90%
That's gone now.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.270 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.785 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard work, that.

00:36:14.785 --> 00:36:16.670 align:middle line:90%
It's hard work to do that.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.310 align:middle line:84%
But that's the difference,
that's the discipline.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.870 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you want attachments or
do you want to transform?

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Up to you.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.860 align:middle line:84%
You can if you're clever have
a little of both in this world.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Thankfully.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I have some constants
in my life, which

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.640 align:middle line:90%
are very important and precious.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a great nomadic
element which, without that,

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:37.680 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't practice my personal
mysticism, such that it is.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't be able
to embody the wisdom.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.920 align:middle line:84%
It would be purely
a mental idea.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So we'll take an example of
two great contemporary mystics,

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Rudolf Steiner--

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love Rudolf Steiner.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.111 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --George
Gurdijieff, right.

00:36:57.111 --> 00:36:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Two very different
characters, yeah?

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner,
a very whole man.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.645 align:middle line:90%
Very brilliant.

00:37:02.645 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Very humble.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:90%
Very excellent in his being.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to say
on the color spectrum,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.100 align:middle line:90%
he is green and blue--

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would say
green and blue, yes.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: And indigo and violet.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:16.607 align:middle line:90%
He is.

00:37:16.607 --> 00:37:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: And,
because of that, it

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.140 align:middle line:84%
works very, very well
across the board.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a safe place.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Great for children.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.522 align:middle line:84%
People will understand
what that is.

00:37:26.522 --> 00:37:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Waldorf system.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:28.813 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Waldorf schools.

00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Waldorf education.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Great, great human
being, who values

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.750 align:middle line:90%
the human potential, Steiner.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Great mystic.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.940 align:middle line:84%
You're going to read,
also, about crazy stuff.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Very challenging.

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:42.970 align:middle line:90%
But that's where he is.

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Gurdjieff, or "Gur-geef," if you
want to say it how he said it.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Red, orange, yellow.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Hard.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Really hard disciplinarian.

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And he will shape
you to say, if you

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:84%
want to sustain your
growth, you have

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.350 align:middle line:90%
to take yourself seriously.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.700 align:middle line:90%
Not someone else's stuff.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Your life is the instrument
for your own change.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, in that way, here's
something to consider.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Steiner was born in 1861,
and he died in 1925.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:21.890 align:middle line:84%
He saw a great world war
delete millions of people

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:90%
from the universe.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that must
never, ever happen again.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.960 align:middle line:84%
He had a wonderful
optimism and a great beauty

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.370 align:middle line:84%
in his transmission of
energy into human potential.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Throughout many
levels of gardening,

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.220 align:middle line:90%
of spirituality, of literature.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Medicine, education.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Really a whole man.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.840 align:middle line:90%
A whole Renaissance man.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Gurdjieff was born a
little later, 1866.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.720 align:middle line:90%
He died, though, in 1949.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.930 align:middle line:90%
He saw two world wars.

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And he famously said of
the Second World War,

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:58.550 align:middle line:84%
this is millions of stupid,
ignorant people killing

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.920 align:middle line:84%
millions of stupid,
ignorant people.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Problem is not nationality, or
land, or ethics, or morality.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It's spiritual ignorance.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.660 align:middle line:90%
And this is the fate of man.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Hence, his hardness.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So there was--
that's relevant today

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.110 align:middle line:84%
because we're still
stuck in that cycle.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:84%
My proposal to the viewers,
to you, is to look at both.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Because somewhere
in the middle, you

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.020 align:middle line:84%
find the balance of
this heart and mind.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And through that, then you
begin to open up this will.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And what I love
about Gurdjieff is

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:37.080 align:middle line:84%
he is very much this sort
of antidote to the New Age.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Peter asked Benski, one of
his students and, later,

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.930 align:middle line:84%
another teacher of
fourth way mysticism,

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:48.310 align:middle line:84%
said what do you make of the man
who tries to develop himself?

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Who goes to classes, and does
yoga, and reads these books,

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.200 align:middle line:90%
and goes to conferences?

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:52.969 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:39:52.969 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And the woman who does this,
and tries to be conscious.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And he says, machines
they were born

00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:59.620 align:middle line:90%
and machines they will die.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is so harsh.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Very, very harsh.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:03.030 align:middle line:90%
I love it, right?

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I love it because it says,
without an extraordinary effort

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.847 align:middle line:84%
of will, and I found
this in my life,

00:40:09.847 --> 00:40:10.930 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to do it.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.250 align:middle line:90%
You're going to talk about it.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:90%
You're going to dress up as it.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.870 align:middle line:90%
You're going to act it.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:16.240 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have moments of it.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.489 align:middle line:90%
But you're not going to do it.

00:40:17.489 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to live it.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.440 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to take
command of yourself.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Once you've attain that
discipline, just like a dancer,

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.210 align:middle line:84%
or just like a
musician, then suddenly,

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.240 align:middle line:84%
you reach a threshold where
it's not hard anymore.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can enjoy the free
form, spontaneity of the music.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:37.130 align:middle line:90%
You can enjoy the free dance.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:39.550 align:middle line:84%
You've got it, because you've
attained the discipline.

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.400 align:middle line:90%
You know what the structure is.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Then you can let rip,
and you can improvise.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in that statement
he was talking about,

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.030 align:middle line:84%
essentially, the
spiritually ignorant masses.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So we go back to that
video with people

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.130 align:middle line:90%
walking in a hypnotic state.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.250 align:middle line:84%
This hypnogogic
state we're in, do

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:58.990 align:middle line:84%
you believe there are
other realms of beings,

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.890 align:middle line:84%
or intelligences that are
actually affecting that state?

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:07.382 align:middle line:84%
Or is it all our
own lack of will?

00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: To put it briefly,
I would say, honestly,

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I would say it's half and half.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.050 align:middle line:84%
The present circumstance
is as much our fault

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.350 align:middle line:90%
as it isn't, right?

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.930 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to say, if
you're a serious student

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and practitioner of
contemporary mysticism,

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:30.820 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to say there are no
external forces and all kinds

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:36.370 align:middle line:84%
of interesting intelligences
outside of Homo sapien

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:38.250 align:middle line:84%
understanding of what
higher intelligence is.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:38.790 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:39.540 align:middle line:90%
There's other worlds.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.320 align:middle line:90%
There's other beings.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.195 align:middle line:90%
There's other forces.

00:41:41.195 --> 00:41:43.080 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.460 align:middle line:84%
It's also the case that
their predominance is down

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.330 align:middle line:90%
to our disavowal.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:52.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you've got-- 7
billion, I think, isn't it--

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:55.970 align:middle line:84%
7 billion people in
a state of disavowal,

00:41:55.970 --> 00:42:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and of ignorance of their own
empowerment, that gives consent

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:02.710 align:middle line:90%
to what I call empire.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's just call it empire.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.240 align:middle line:84%
We can imagine them as
Egyptians, or Romans,

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.280 align:middle line:84%
or Mongols, or
Brits, or Americans.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it empire.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine that its
unbroken for 25,000 years.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And let's imagine there's all
kinds of interesting science

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.310 align:middle line:84%
fiction forces that
plug into that.

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:24.240 align:middle line:90%
That only works with consent.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And the way you give
consent is to disavow will.

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:28.030 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:29.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the game.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as you
grasp your own will,

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:36.210 align:middle line:84%
you withdraw consent and
the system collapses.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But you try telling
that to the guys walking

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:44.030 align:middle line:84%
around Wall Street, and
Madison Avenue, and Hollywood.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.721 align:middle line:84%
And the malls and
the grocery stores.

00:42:46.721 --> 00:42:48.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
you're talking about.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:50.200 align:middle line:84%
What's that got to
do with anything?

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.910 align:middle line:84%
So it requires education,
as Steiner understood,

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:53.860 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.630 align:middle line:84%
You've got to talk to people in
a fair and open way, early on.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:00.700 align:middle line:84%
If you come to them
as students, graduated

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.970 align:middle line:84%
from Oxford, and Cambridge,
and Harvard, and Yale,

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:03.980 align:middle line:90%
and Berkeley, and stuff.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Too late.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Too late.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.640 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Too late.

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
would say, then,

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:84%
back to the first part of
that answer, kind of 50-50.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.500 align:middle line:84%
We have external forces that
are able to exert because we

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.070 align:middle line:90%
are in this state of disavowal.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look,
alternatively, you

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.210 align:middle line:84%
look at the subject of higher
consciousness, and higher

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:29.830 align:middle line:84%
intelligences, and a
state of non interference.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at the
irony of what actually

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.930 align:middle line:84%
happens between
those two realities.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: Very important,
that, in my view.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Non interference
means that the higher

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.995 align:middle line:84%
the level of
consciousness, the more it

00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:46.500 align:middle line:84%
has to accept, and
abide by, what I

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.550 align:middle line:90%
would call a universal law.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Which is, you cannot contravene
the will of a sovereign being.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And the higher the
consciousness, as I say,

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.730 align:middle line:84%
the more you have
to respect that.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.180 align:middle line:84%
If you're just a guy on
the street who's in a mess,

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I can walk out of there
at the end of today,

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:05.318 align:middle line:84%
and he sticks a knife in
me, and takes the wallet out

00:44:05.318 --> 00:44:06.540 align:middle line:90%
of my back pocket.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Because the
consciousness is low.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.450 align:middle line:90%
So he can contravene my will.

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Empire isn't playing a
low consciousness game.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.330 align:middle line:84%
It's playing a high
consciousness game,

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:17.630 align:middle line:84%
which we'll come
to, perhaps later.

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And that means that it needs
our consent to function.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It says, I'm going to
change your reality.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.380 align:middle line:90%
And you go, yep.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.970 align:middle line:90%
And then it can do it.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:27.800 align:middle line:90%
If you say, no.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.290 align:middle line:90%
It can't touch you.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:30.240 align:middle line:90%
It cannot touch you.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.580 align:middle line:90%
It can do nothing.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And that consent is harvested
by all manner of things,

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:40.310 align:middle line:84%
from-- if you look at our
friends and colleagues who

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:43.540 align:middle line:84%
are studying this from a
sovereign, legal, freeman

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:46.040 align:middle line:84%
perspective, whatever you want
to call it-- having a driving

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:50.760 align:middle line:84%
license, a passport, swearing
an oath are ways of harvesting

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.730 align:middle line:90%
consent.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Using money is a way
of giving consent.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Really difficult things
to get away from,

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that people like you and I
have been brought up to think,

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:00.432 align:middle line:90%
well, this is just stuff.

00:45:00.432 --> 00:45:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about that.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:02.430 align:middle line:90%
No, it isn't.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a practical means
of harvesting consent.

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.230 align:middle line:90%
To permit, and license yourself.

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:10.820 align:middle line:84%
To authenticate yourself
to be in the world

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.310 align:middle line:90%
is an act of disavowal.

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So you have to slowly begin
to move away from that.

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:19.220 align:middle line:90%
What I would say, work at that.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Work at that.

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Consider how you can
begin to withdraw consent

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.270 align:middle line:90%
from those things.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Seek paths of exemption,
is one of the phrases

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.140 align:middle line:90%
we use in the business.

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.710 align:middle line:84%
What you can also do
is start to realize

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:34.270 align:middle line:84%
that the reality that's
offered up to you isn't it.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.200 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is the
most powerful way

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.450 align:middle line:84%
to start because you've got
total control over that.

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:42.292 align:middle line:84%
But it's so
overwhelming, the sort

00:45:42.292 --> 00:45:45.510 align:middle line:90%
of scientific dictatorship.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, programs like
yours erode that nonsense

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:51.330 align:middle line:90%
and introduce real scientists.

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Real innovation.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Real medicine.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Real physics.

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Real biology.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But the presiding
consciousness says

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:02.750 align:middle line:84%
the authorities will
tell you what is real.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:05.260 align:middle line:84%
What you think is
just meaningless.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.720 align:middle line:84%
That is very, very
hard to do undo that.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Very hard to undo.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is a process of
years of conditioning,

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.340 align:middle line:84%
which is part of
confronting the negative.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Part of developing
will, to say, is it OK

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.270 align:middle line:90%
for me to decide what is real?

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Most people think no.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Most people think no.

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And it requires a
great encouragement,

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and a great compassion, and
a great faith in each other

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:33.458 align:middle line:90%
to reverse that.

00:46:33.458 --> 00:46:36.150 align:middle line:90%


00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking
at these-- again,

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:43.000 align:middle line:84%
we were talking a moment ago
about the notion of the higher

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.230 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-- higher
intelligence, which does not--

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:50.970 align:middle line:84%
is not allowed, by a
universal principle,

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:54.730 align:middle line:84%
to interfere with any kind
of developing species.

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:58.220 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean we can't
interface with those realms.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.400 align:middle line:90%
That's different.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.510 align:middle line:90%
By choice.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:03.010 align:middle line:84%
But can you talk a
little bit about that?

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: If you want
to go to the frontier

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and be the pioneer,
Lewis and Clark,

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:13.920 align:middle line:84%
with your musket and
your boots on, fantastic.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:14.816 align:middle line:90%
You will find things.

00:47:14.816 --> 00:47:15.940 align:middle line:90%
You will find other worlds.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.120 align:middle line:90%
They are there.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.230 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to say no to that.

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I have lots-- vast
personal experience

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:26.960 align:middle line:84%
that is not relevant for
public broadcast, if I may say,

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's perfectly
communicable amongst those

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.780 align:middle line:90%
who are also doing it.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know on your show,
I've done my homework

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:37.270 align:middle line:84%
before I came today,
people are very

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:41.570 align:middle line:84%
happy to talk about channels
and different communication.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.705 align:middle line:84%
Aliens, and nature
spirits, and elementals,

00:47:43.705 --> 00:47:44.830 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't think your guys have
a problem with that, do they?

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.381 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:47:48.381 --> 00:47:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: That is there.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.570 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that,
again, unless you

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:59.530 align:middle line:84%
know your vessel, which
is mind, heart, will,

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:02.720 align:middle line:84%
you only have on faith
that the incoming channel

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle line:90%
is who it says it is.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, and I say this
very conservatively and very

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.410 align:middle line:84%
favorably, 90% of
it is nonsense.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.750 align:middle line:90%
And dangerous and harmful.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And, in the end,
it's limited what

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.770 align:middle line:84%
danger can be-- what havoc
can be wreaked by that.

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:23.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's confusing
because you get

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.640 align:middle line:84%
lots of neophytes,
and greenhorns,

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and wonderful new
people who come and say,

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything,
but I want to know.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.800 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:30.640 align:middle line:90%
What shall I read?

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.250 align:middle line:90%
What shall I get off the shelf?

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to Powells, and
Borders, and The Bodhi Tree

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.090 align:middle line:90%
and get all these things.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And they go away with a
massive load of confusion.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:41.980 align:middle line:90%
And of uncertainty.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Because there's mud and
pearls all mixed up together.

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:47.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to say.

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:50.775 align:middle line:84%
So again, the power of
discernment cannot be

00:48:50.775 --> 00:48:51.400 align:middle line:90%
underestimated.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.108 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to say.

00:48:53.108 --> 00:48:55.540 align:middle line:84%
This takes a high
degree of discretion.

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.650 align:middle line:84%
As you say, you must
know your own vehicle.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:03.187 align:middle line:84%
And it must be wired sensitively
to understand what has truth.

00:49:03.187 --> 00:49:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Even though if we're calling
it subjective or objective.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.228 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: You do.

00:49:06.228 --> 00:49:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And classical Hindu culture,
from which Hindu philosophy

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality
is a part-- which

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:15.000 align:middle line:84%
is why it gives it
greater credence

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.792 align:middle line:84%
and penetration than Buddhism--
which is, as Alan Watts,

00:49:17.792 --> 00:49:19.250 align:middle line:84%
the great British
philosopher, used

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:23.490 align:middle line:84%
to say, Buddhism is Hindu
spirituality stripped

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:25.320 align:middle line:90%
for export, right?

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.665 align:middle line:84%
You miss something out if
you just do the Buddhism.

00:49:27.665 --> 00:49:29.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's fantastic.

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.730 align:middle line:90%
But you miss something out.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.959 align:middle line:84%
And that is the culture of
Hindu spiritual philosophy.

00:49:33.959 --> 00:49:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It would take a young man,
as it was in those days, now

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:38.390 align:middle line:84%
young women, as
well, thankfully.

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:40.020 align:middle line:90%
And make them a whole man.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:43.320 align:middle line:84%
A Renaissance man, who
was a warrior, musician.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.120 align:middle line:84%
They would teach
them how to cook.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.520 align:middle line:90%
How to make love.

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.870 align:middle line:90%
How to dress.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:48.760 align:middle line:90%
How to be.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.330 align:middle line:90%
How to speak.

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:51.610 align:middle line:90%
How to run.

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:53.240 align:middle line:90%
And create a whole man.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.870 align:middle line:90%
A whole man, right?

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And say, only then can
you bring in this thing

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:00.590 align:middle line:90%
that we call Spirit.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Only then can you do that.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Before that point, you'll
have a sense of it.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And you'll taste it.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And smell it in the
wind here and there

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:13.370 align:middle line:84%
on a mountaintop, or in
a cafe, or a conference,

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:15.310 align:middle line:90%
or a gathering around the fire.

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But then it will escape you
because you're not disciplined.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:20.180 align:middle line:90%
You have no will.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.440 align:middle line:90%
You don't know who you are.

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.023 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
you're capable of.

00:50:23.023 --> 00:50:24.840 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what you are not.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So that is a thing
that comes back

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.250 align:middle line:84%
through contemporary
practical mysticism.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:31.380 align:middle line:90%
It says, be a whole person.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.610 align:middle line:90%
A whole woman.

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:33.430 align:middle line:90%
A whole man.

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Only then can you do anything.

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, you're
playing in the sand pit.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, as you
were talking about,

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.910 align:middle line:84%
taking home arm loads of books,
at what point-- and I asked

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:48.300 align:middle line:84%
this myself, of myself-- I've
read, I can't even count,

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:54.570 align:middle line:84%
of course, book after book after
book for 30 years in this area.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And at what point do you just
stop and you start practicing?

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.560 align:middle line:84%
You start applying
the knowledge,

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.294 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
garnering more knowledge?

00:51:06.294 --> 00:51:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's a
very common thing

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:13.210 align:middle line:84%
to go to the sources
of these shows,

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:15.330 align:middle line:90%
like this, and soak them up.

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And learn.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:17.050 align:middle line:90%
And keep listening.

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you get a
bit more discerning.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:19.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, that guy's no good.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.000 align:middle line:90%
This guy was good.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.650 align:middle line:90%
She was good.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:21.800 align:middle line:90%
That was rubbish.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.037 align:middle line:84%
And you gradually
build a discernment.

00:51:24.037 --> 00:51:25.620 align:middle line:84%
In the early days,
though, what people

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:26.890 align:middle line:90%
do is they read everything.

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're constantly
listening to the MP3s,

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and watching the videos,
and all the rest of it.

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:35.057 align:middle line:84%
And nearly everyone I know, who
I have ongoing communication

00:51:35.057 --> 00:51:37.390 align:middle line:84%
with, at some point, comes
back and says, you know what?

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I've stopped doing that now.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I do it sparingly.

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
live broadcast TV,

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.670 align:middle line:84%
so I'm happy to have
another medium for that.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.920 align:middle line:84%
But the volume of
it is different now.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that I've
got something to do now.

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Not to think.

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:57.200 align:middle line:90%
No rumination or cogitation.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Not this abstraction, but
to actually do something.

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:05.720 align:middle line:84%
To put the books, and the
notes, and the papers down.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And get rid of that and
go and do something.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And that-- you
know when that is.

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:11.180 align:middle line:90%
You know when that is.

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not far in.

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:15.070 align:middle line:84%
It should be one,
two, three years in.

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:17.420 align:middle line:90%
And then that comes to a close.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that you
are now moving down as,

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:22.260 align:middle line:84%
in Victorian and
Georgian mysticism

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.480 align:middle line:84%
of that classical
era of 1880s-1900.

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.880 align:middle line:84%
They would say, you're in a
particular magical stream.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.840 align:middle line:90%
And you realize what yours is.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's
shamanic or mystical.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Whether it's hard or soft.

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.720 align:middle line:84%
European, Native
American, Meso-American.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, you start
to know your lineage.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:46.020 align:middle line:84%
You start to connect with it
and move in your magical stream.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.250 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, you
can put the books away

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:51.190 align:middle line:84%
because they can't
teach you anything new.

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like "The
Matrix," where, say look,

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:56.900 align:middle line:84%
there's this great vast thing
out there, of knowingness,

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and you just plug into it.

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And this linear way of doing it
is very significant for a time.

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's,
frankly, just nice

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to sit with a book and a
cup of tea and your pipe.

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:08.989 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not you, but.

00:53:08.989 --> 00:53:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: And read, right?

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And actually go through the
lovely traditional thing

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:14.730 align:middle line:84%
of putting your
fingers on the paper.

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:16.610 align:middle line:90%
And turning the page.

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And the window's here
and it's raining outside.

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lovely,
intimate relationship

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.840 align:middle line:84%
you're having with somebody's
words and thoughts.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.030 align:middle line:90%
That's lovely.

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy that.

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:29.520 align:middle line:84%
But the actual process
of knowingedness

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.880 align:middle line:84%
is very limited with
linear knowledge.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.470 align:middle line:84%
It comes through
higher being, which

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:38.220 align:middle line:84%
is this confluence of
mind and heart and will.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.650 align:middle line:90%
That teaches you stuff.

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Things unknown that cannot
be read off the page.

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.990 align:middle line:84%
That cannot be had
from somebody's mouth.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.550 align:middle line:84%
They come through your
own personal interaction

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:50.780 align:middle line:90%
with reality.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Only.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all
higher knowledge resides.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're really
big on applied wisdom

00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.949 align:middle line:84%
and the characteristics
of applied wisdom.

00:53:58.949 --> 00:54:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Very, very insistent.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.339 align:middle line:90%
Very insistent about that.

00:54:01.339 --> 00:54:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
characteristics, the three H's,

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.809 align:middle line:84%
characteristics
of applied wisdom.

00:54:07.809 --> 00:54:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: You've got
disembodied knowledge.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.460 align:middle line:90%
I know these things.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Here's some da-- stuff.

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Wow, he knows loads of things.

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But their lives
aren't changing oftentimes.

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Well done.

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:18.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
a lot of people,

00:54:18.745 --> 00:54:20.270 align:middle line:90%
and myself included depending--

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.894 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Yeah.

00:54:20.894 --> 00:54:21.535 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:54:21.535 --> 00:54:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where
you might know.

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It's all here.

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if
you're not applying it,

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.160 align:middle line:90%
it really is not relevant.

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.993 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: It's disembodied
knowledge, right?

00:54:26.993 --> 00:54:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Starts off like a good starting
point, but without destination.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Starts off like that.

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Embodied wisdom is
where you live it.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:36.340 align:middle line:90%
You feel it.

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.350 align:middle line:90%
You sweat it.

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:38.160 align:middle line:90%
You bleed it.

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.190 align:middle line:90%
You cry it.

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:41.660 align:middle line:84%
You're in the fetal
position on the floor

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.040 align:middle line:90%
because your life's collapsed.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, now you're
talking about wisdom.

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:48.110 align:middle line:84%
That starts to mean
something then, right?

00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, it's
just some nice ideas.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And people with
lots of nice ideas

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.200 align:middle line:90%
usually have rubbish lives.

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.340 align:middle line:90%
They're in disarray.

00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:01.660 align:middle line:84%
A lovely rule of thumb for
this, look for this, right.

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Look for this as a marker
of attainment and wisdom.

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:08.240 align:middle line:10%
That is a track
record of wisdom.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.290 align:middle line:10%
Number one, humility.

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:11.170 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:14.420 align:middle line:10%
The wisest people I've
met, as me, on this planet,

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.980 align:middle line:10%
all have that.

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.750 align:middle line:90%
And I've remarked on that.

00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:19.759 align:middle line:90%
A great humility.

00:55:19.759 --> 00:55:21.800 align:middle line:84%
They're not always telling
me about all the stuff

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.680 align:middle line:90%
they've done.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:26.035 align:middle line:84%
They're not always firing names
and accomplishments at me.

00:55:26.035 --> 00:55:27.790 align:middle line:90%
They say nothing.

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:29.380 align:middle line:90%
And they say, look at that.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Look at that bluebird
on the branch.

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:35.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what they say.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't tell
me about anything.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:40.580 align:middle line:84%
They're in here, where we
are, sharing something, right?

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Great humility.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Walk down, with your
head bowed, like this.

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Be happy where you are
with what you've got.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And an understanding that
your ego is in check.

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:51.510 align:middle line:90%
And you can be strong and big.

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can be a bit
visceral and vociferous,

00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:58.770 align:middle line:90%
like I'm being a little bit now.

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And then be very
gentle and quiet.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And be at home with that,
just as any other time.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So humility is
absolutely essential.

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So if I-- in my
business, as in yours--

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.970 align:middle line:84%
we come across people who
profess great wisdom, don't we?

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:17.775 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I look
for, is this a humble man

00:56:17.775 --> 00:56:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Is this a humble woman?

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:21.760 align:middle line:90%
No, it isn't.

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.735 align:middle line:84%
So that calls into question
the professed wisdom.

00:56:24.735 --> 00:56:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have a
lot of knowledge

00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:27.490 align:middle line:90%
and unfolded and changing.

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:28.335 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:56:28.335 --> 00:56:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But don't profess wisdom
if you haven't got humility

00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:32.870 align:middle line:90%
because they go hand in hand.

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:34.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm still working on mine.

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:36.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a work in progress,
as everything else is.

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:39.870 align:middle line:84%
But I've noticed that the
very great men and women have

00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:43.810 align:middle line:84%
it, humility, in
every step, right?

00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:46.000 align:middle line:10%
Another H, humor.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.310 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:51.590 align:middle line:10%
Humor is so unique to
humanity, I can't tell you.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:57.480 align:middle line:84%
There is the thought that
many visiting intelligences,

00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.070 align:middle line:84%
let's just say that, come
here to look at humor.

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:03.116 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
exist anywhere else.

00:57:03.116 --> 00:57:04.990 align:middle line:84%
You see, the humans have
got this funny thing

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the
few great gifts

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:10.980 align:middle line:84%
that keeps that rubbish species
keep evolving, and bettering

00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.880 align:middle line:84%
itself, and dreaming
of excellence.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Humor is like this
extraordinary, implacable force

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that they have that
cuts through the biggest

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:21.870 align:middle line:90%
disasters imaginable.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's where
it often comes out.

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:25.350 align:middle line:90%
It's like, why?

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: It does.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.140 align:middle line:90%
And you have to laugh.

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And you have to see it.

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And the dearest
people to meet, let

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:36.740 align:middle line:84%
me think of a few--
Alan Watts I mentioned,

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:39.010 align:middle line:84%
the great, great, great
British philosopher,

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and I would say
mystic, born in 1915.

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Died in 1973.

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:44.170 align:middle line:90%
I never got to meet him.

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:46.960 align:middle line:90%
I was just a little kid.

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:47.980 align:middle line:90%
One of the few regrets.

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll see him later, though.

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Shunryu Suzuki.

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Great Zen teacher.

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Frank Zappa, brilliant
social critic.

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Musician.

00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Of course, Bill Hicks.

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Of course, George Carlin.

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Mark Twain.

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Jonathan Swift.

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Great satirists.

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet people who penetrate
American and British culture

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:12.300 align:middle line:84%
with extraordinary deftness,
and skill, and beauty.

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.880 align:middle line:90%
And allow us to approach things.

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The first conspiracy
theorist, Bill Hicks.

00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Not many people were
doing it in the '80s.

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.490 align:middle line:90%
There were a few.

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:23.064 align:middle line:84%
But on a mass level, he
was talking about things

00:58:23.064 --> 00:58:24.605 align:middle line:84%
that we're just
catching up with now.

00:58:24.605 --> 00:58:25.188 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:25.188 --> 00:58:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: But it was a joke.

00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:27.540 align:middle line:90%
And it was humor.

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So we could approach
it and think, ha,

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:30.720 align:middle line:90%
that was funny and everything.

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.180 align:middle line:90%
And he's very challenging.

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah.

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.340 align:middle line:84%
What he said is a real thing
that I need to look at.

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Humor.

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Watch people who
never smile and laugh.

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Watch out for that.

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:43.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a sign of something.

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.660 align:middle line:10%
Another final H, three
H's, householder, right?

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:47.444 align:middle line:10%
Funny word, this.

00:58:47.444 --> 00:58:48.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Householder.

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.276 align:middle line:10%
>>KRAMER: Householder.

00:58:49.276 --> 00:58:51.640 align:middle line:90%


00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.410 align:middle line:84%
These three guys, George
Gurdjieff, Morris Nicole,

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Peter Ouspensky, teach
in this fourth way,

00:58:57.970 --> 00:59:00.490 align:middle line:84%
I would say hermetic
representative,

00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:02.620 align:middle line:90%
brilliant mystical tradition.

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Modern, brilliant,
results driven, human.

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:12.940 align:middle line:84%
They were so tired of getting
people who were not up to it

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:17.510 align:middle line:84%
come through the doors that they
had to ramp up the admissions

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:20.080 align:middle line:84%
process to make sure it
was only serious people.

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So there's three
types of people:

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:24.490 align:middle line:84%
lunatics, tramps,
and householders.

00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Good householders.

00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:29.250 align:middle line:84%
A good householder is someone
who can organize themselves,

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:31.810 align:middle line:84%
knows how to be
in a family, knows

00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:35.160 align:middle line:84%
how to organize their
finances and their stuff,

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:39.860 align:middle line:84%
knows how to conduct themselves,
and is generally reliable.

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Solid, reliable.

00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
here at 10 past 1.

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:45.710 align:middle line:90%
I will be here at 10 past 1.

00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:47.270 align:middle line:90%
You can count on that.

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:51.460 align:middle line:84%
The lunatic might be full
of knowledge and brilliance,

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:53.700 align:middle line:90%
and might be a politician.

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Might be a great military man.

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:57.740 align:middle line:90%
A great poet.

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But is lacking, right,
in that reliability.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.840 align:middle line:90%
In that discernment.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.190 align:middle line:90%
In that judgment.

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.190 align:middle line:90%
The tramp.

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Lots of great intent, right?

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Lots of amazing hope, and
great feeling of spirituality,

01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:17.470 align:middle line:84%
a great desire to
see a better world,

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:19.630 align:middle line:84%
to see clean oceans
and happy skies.

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:20.440 align:middle line:90%
We understand that.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wrong with that.

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:23.220 align:middle line:90%
But that's it.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.370 align:middle line:90%
No discipline.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:25.200 align:middle line:90%
No discernment.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:25.960 align:middle line:90%
No judgment.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.900 align:middle line:90%
No reliability.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.570 align:middle line:84%
They can't run a
household, as it were.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:32.310 align:middle line:90%
They cannot run a household.

01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So in those days,
those guys said, right.

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Being a good householder
is the starting point

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.580 align:middle line:84%
for a man or woman of
spiritual substance.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And until then, go away.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Learn to be a good householder
first, then come to us.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:49.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's become--

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, grounded.

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:52.926 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: --it's become a very
strong marker for me, that.

01:00:52.926 --> 01:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Because as you
well know yourself,

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of tramps,
figuratively speaking,

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.280 align:middle line:90%
in the New Age movement.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.225 align:middle line:90%
Lovely people, right.

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not judging them
because I don't know them.

01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:04.180 align:middle line:90%
No point.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
But I can see that they
can't sustain growth

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:10.220 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't learned the
art of the householder, right?

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
So there's some very firm,
practical, literal meaning

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.180 align:middle line:90%
in that.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And some figurative
associations,

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.200 align:middle line:90%
as you can imagine.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.420 align:middle line:90%
But being a good householder.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So you have humility,
humor, householder.

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.040 align:middle line:90%
Markers of wisdom.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.220 align:middle line:84%
If they're not there,
there's something missing.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And finally, you
look to actions, to deeds,

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:32.090 align:middle line:90%
to conduct.

01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:34.390 align:middle line:84%
You're not so
interested in what--

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I don't care
what they're saying.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --people have
to say, ideologically.

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:38.301 align:middle line:84%
>>KRAMER: I'm not interested
in what people are saying.

01:01:38.301 --> 01:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It's of no interest
to me, at all, right?

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It comes and goes,
that, doesn't it?

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And some people are very
clever and it's nice.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And some people are
stupid and it's boring.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.500 align:middle line:90%
That comes and goes.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And we can ramp
that up and down.

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
The only marker, the
only way, the only method

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.470 align:middle line:84%
of demonstrating and embodying
wisdom is in deeds and conduct.

01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:58.990 align:middle line:90%
What you do and how you do it.

01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Not what you say,
not what you think.

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Not any ideology.

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm not interested in that.

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And the wisest, most brilliant
people I've met in the world,

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:09.000 align:middle line:90%
neither are they.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Neither was Rudolf Steiner.

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Neither was George Gurdjieff.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.760 align:middle line:90%
They're not interested in that.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Show me what you do,
and what you've done.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:18.080 align:middle line:90%
And show me how you did it.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.850 align:middle line:90%
How did you conduct yourself?

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:21.980 align:middle line:10%
Do you know how to
conduct yourself?

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:25.280 align:middle line:10%
With your mother and your
child and your colleagues

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.120 align:middle line:10%
and the lady in the post office
and the guy at the Immigration

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:29.670 align:middle line:10%
Services.

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how to conduct
yourself in those environments?

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:40.547 align:middle line:84%
Because those are the practical
flesh of your spiritual life.

01:02:40.547 --> 01:02:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:41.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.949 align:middle line:84%
On that note, we're
going to do this again,

01:02:44.949 --> 01:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
because I think we're just
getting warmed up, actually.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:47.865 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Good.

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK?

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:50.724 align:middle line:84%
Profound, and also
very grounded.

01:02:50.724 --> 01:02:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Neil.

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:52.474 align:middle line:90%
>>KRAMER: Thank you.

01:02:52.474 --> 01:02:53.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can
immerse yourself

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:56.440 align:middle line:10%
in this kind of mature
spiritual contemplation

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.630 align:middle line:10%
by going to Neil's
