>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Simon Chokoisky

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.760 align:middle line:10%
is with us once
again, to dip into

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:10%
the Vedic astrological
influences of these absolutely

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:10%
crazy times.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.341 align:middle line:84%
We're going to focus
on Bitcoin and luck.

00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
We all need some of that
at this point in time,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.591 align:middle line:84%
and I think we're going to
have some fun looking at how

00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:35.992 align:middle line:90%
we can better engage with luck.

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Right now, people
aren't talking too much

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:84%
about good joss or
luck, and that's

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:90%
more of the dominant story.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's so fun
that you've actually

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:84%
been spending your
time calculating

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:84%
the odds of good
luck for everybody.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON CHOKOISKY: Yeah,
and I'm the Guinea pig.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're the Guinea pig.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Right.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.977 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to really go

00:00:52.977 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
into what you're doing, and
even show some video of what

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:90%
you're doing.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we move
our way into luck,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:84%
because I want to finish
on this happy lucky note.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
First of all for
everybody, let's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:84%
recap the time of the
outsider, the years, and some

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:84%
of what you have told us before,
just to set the stage for right

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:10%
So we are, the world is
in an outsider lifecycle.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is, new
technologies, new philosophies,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:90%
new ideas.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:10%
Out with the old,
in with the new.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes the
transition is abrupt.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's always, it can
be very uncomfortable.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
it's for the good.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So even though we're in
an uncomfortable time now,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.953 align:middle line:84%
10, 20 years from now,
these new technologies,

00:01:41.953 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:84%
new things that
are coming in that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:84%
started right around 20,
just before 2016, 2015 or so.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And we've got about
another 10 years left.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.303 align:middle line:90%
So it's not over.

00:01:54.303 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it's barely begun.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But one
thing I remember

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.760 align:middle line:84%
you saying when we talked
about this once before, is,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:90%
and this was before.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:84%
This, I think, was
in 2019, was you

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:84%
said of this cycle, the most
chaotic period of this cycle

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
that could be perceived
as chaotic, because it's

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
about change, that
the most densely

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
saturated chaotic
energy would be in 2020.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.060 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know why.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Like what would be
the causative factor.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of the way it
is with outsiders and outsider

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:90%
periods.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:90%
It comes out from left field.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the punch, it's the
hook that catches you

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.035 align:middle line:84%
that you don't see
that knocks you out,

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:90%
not the one that you see.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So this January I made a video
on YouTube about Bitcoin.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, listen, it's about
to go down about February 9,

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.087 align:middle line:90%
I forget the dates.

00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:90%
You could see it on there.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:90%
February 20 and then to March.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And it could be from a terrorist
event, could be from a virus,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
could be from something that
is just so out of the blue

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:90%
that it knocks us out.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
to be from a virus.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're still in that
period, we're still

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:90%
recovering from that period.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's a crazy year.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But there is
something good in it.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.367 align:middle line:90%
There is a huge silver lining.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:90%
And I hope we can talk about it.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I do want to
talk about it, because I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:90%
see it the same way.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I see it just as the
wake up call for humanity

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.888 align:middle line:84%
to re-evaluate life values,
what really matters,

00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:84%
even look at the
nature of our health

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and immune system
from a fresh, new more

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:84%
responsible way, a bunch
of silver linings it it.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.085 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts?

00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the
silver linings now

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
before we go to
some other things.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Relationships.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
It's forcing you to
actually talk to the person

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:84%
that you live with, because you
don't get, you're not at work

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
eight hours a day and they're
not at work, so you're at home.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it'll
break relationships,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:84%
but it'll definitely
strain relationships, even

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:90%
the good ones.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But out of that strain
comes, it's like a muscle.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.797 align:middle line:84%
When you work it,
it gets stronger.

00:03:59.797 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and if you have
enough strain for long enough,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.088 align:middle line:84%
you're going to break
down at some point,

00:04:04.088 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to go into
kind of conversations or.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Honest conversations.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Screaming matches
that have deeper truths in them,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of people
have been going through.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.297 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's straining
the court dockets for divorces

00:04:17.297 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:84%
right now, because
so many people want

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to, now that
they've spoken, want

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:90%
to get away from each other.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.270 align:middle line:84%
But others have really come
down to the nitty gritty

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:90%
of where the differences were.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Well, better
sooner than later.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
If the divorce is coming,
just get it over with now.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Pop that pimple.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.615 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Pop the pimple
or allow yourself, now

00:04:34.615 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that you've gotten to it, to
go into the healing of that.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the silver linings.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Another is just to see
how fragile we are.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:84%
As a society, we
depend on electricity.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:84%
What happens if that
electricity goes out?

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.330 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we
can't go to work?

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.810 align:middle line:84%
But even as human
beings, if we can't

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:84%
interact with one another,
how that affects us socially.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of people
are really realizing

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're depressed
if they're not around

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.432 align:middle line:90%
friends and other humans.

00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:07.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Extroverts, this
has been hell for extroverts.

00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: I'm more
of an introvert,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:90%
so for me it's like, corona?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:90%
What corona?

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.263 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: But because I
mostly work from home,

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:15.430 align:middle line:90%
and it's that type of thing.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.467 align:middle line:84%
But my friends who are more of
the extroverts are going nuts.

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I have one
friend who's, I'm an introvert,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:90%
so I work from home.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
live in the country.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have my favorite
little coffee shops,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:90%
they're still open.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can go
to if I want to.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:90%
And I go on my bike ride.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
So life hasn't really
changed much for me at all.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But oh my God, one
friend in particular,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:84%
she just calls up in full
on panic and anxiety.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.463 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's canceling
every event!

00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where I can go.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.922 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe they're not
going to show up for lunch.

00:05:44.922 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And just panic stricken at the
lack of human companionship.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.483 align:middle line:84%
And I, I mean, it's really
causing her mass anxiety.

00:05:52.483 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the percentages,
but at least half the planet

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:90%
have to be extroverts.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Sure.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really suffering.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:90%
And what about kids?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is where knowing who
you are comes in very handy.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.040 align:middle line:90%
When you understand who you are.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I do astrology,
because you can look

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:90%
at your chart and you go, huh.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.755 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's how this
is affecting me.

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:84%
All right, how do
I deal with it?

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Like right now, I
have knee problems.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's right
there in my chart.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:84%
For the next six months, you're
going to have knee problems.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, right on time.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
It sucks, it's terrible, but
you know that there's a tunnel.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get out of it.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So same thing with
your extrovert friends.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.900 align:middle line:84%
You could just say,
listen, this is temporary.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:90%
It's about to be over.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So prepare for when
it is over and how

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.950 align:middle line:90%
you can celebrate those times.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Because people, we take
our freedom for granted.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: When it's taken away
from us, we go, oh, crap.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:90%
This sucks.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:90%
So be ready to celebrate it.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.012 align:middle line:84%
And I think the other
thing that has really

00:06:56.012 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
come out of this too, is
how you can do work-arounds.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, a lot of people
have turned to Zoom or Skype

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:84%
to do these group
family, group friendship

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:84%
calls on a regular
basis to satisfy

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.340 align:middle line:84%
that need for connection
and seeing someone's face.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.155 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that's come out of it.

00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's caused
some problems for Zoom,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:84%
but they're getting up
to speed technologically.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The point
is, that people

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
have found innovative
ways to still satisfy that

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.180 align:middle line:90%
to an extent.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Thank God
for Alex Mashinsky.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who's Alex?

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Alex is a
Ukrainian-born entrepreneur who

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.200 align:middle line:90%
invented voice over internet.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:90%
This is way back in the '90s.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:90%
He has the patents.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm
going to take away

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.903 align:middle line:84%
the power of AT&T and
Verizon, because it

00:07:40.903 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
used to be like $3 bucks a
minute, $2 bucks a minute

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:90%
to talk to people.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.065 align:middle line:90%
Now it's free.

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So we can all talk
over Zoom and Skype.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank god.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And his
next invention now

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:84%
is something called the Celsius
app, which is, by the way,

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.075 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a, I'm not a paid
spokesperson or anything,

00:07:58.075 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:90%
but I use it and I love it.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is it?

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: It's, he calls
it, money over internet.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:90%
It's his big--

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is that?

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how is that compared
to some of the others that

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.378 align:middle line:90%
exist, like Venmo and all?

00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Well, this,
because it's cryptocurrency.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And this is
the other big innovation

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:90%
that's happening.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
talk about money, yes.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: In this outsider period
is the revolution of money,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And how
we have the ability

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
to take power over our own
finances with cryptocurrency

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.970 align:middle line:84%
rather than it being owned
by the banks and even

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:90%
the government fiat.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.919 align:middle line:84%
So Alex Mashinsky has
an app called Celsius,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and it lets you earn 10%
interest on your dollars

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying, hey, we used
to have savings accounts,

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:90%
now we don't.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to put them back
in the hands of people.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So what he did with
voice over internet,

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:84%
he's doing with
money over internet.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How does it work?

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So you have
$100, you convert

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:84%
that into a digital crypto, like
in the US, it's called Tether.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Or you can buy Bitcoin.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
You can buy any of
the cryptocurrencies,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and you just put
them in that wallet.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So the wallet is
like a bank account.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And it immediately
starts earning.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:90%
So Bitcoin earns around 4%, 5%.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:84%
The one that's 1 to 1 to the
dollar, so if have $100 bucks,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:84%
you buy $100 Tether,
it's called Tether.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Earns you about 8%, 9% I think.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, depending on the week.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:90%
And you just get that in kind.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's compounded interest.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Like Einstein said,
compound interest

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
is one of most powerful
forces in the universe.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:84%
It's weird that we're
talking about that now,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.420 align:middle line:84%
but just came to my mind
that during outsider times,

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
we get innovative
solutions to problems

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:90%
we didn't even know we had.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Because you give
your $100 bucks to the bank,

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.710 align:middle line:84%
they loan it out and they
make 15% to 20% interest

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:90%
for credit card debt.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You make nothing.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.088 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: You not
only make nothing,

00:09:51.088 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:90%
but you're charged fees.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
transfer fee, there's

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.347 align:middle line:84%
an overdraft fee, underdraft
fee, middle draft fee,

00:09:59.347 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:90%
there's all kinds of fees.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So those fees
are in the billions.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.695 align:middle line:84%
I think $60 billion
a year collectively.

00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And they
don't get paid to you,

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.340 align:middle line:84%
they get paid to
the bank investors.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So what Mashinky's saying, hey,
you should get that interest.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:21.485 align:middle line:84%
So he's giving people more
of a share of their savings

00:10:21.485 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:90%
than the bank account does.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how does
this work though?

00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So you take your $100
of old style money.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Fiat money, right.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, fiat money.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.593 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: US dollars.

00:10:28.593 --> 00:10:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you
invest in say, $100.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: You buy $100 worth.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tether.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Of Tether.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of Tether.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.218 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Which is
still worth $100.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now it's
earning say 8% or 9%.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
How do you, how are you
able to use it functionally?

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: You don't.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So when you want
that as money again,

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:84%
you convert it back
into US dollars.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So you can convert it
back to fiat currency.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: That's it.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.137 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So if you want
to hold it for a year,

00:10:50.137 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
there are no penalties,
there are no fees.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's cool.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: It is very
cool, isn't it?

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I've got, I'm invested in that.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Because the way, and
this is something

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:84%
that we can talk about,
the monetary system

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.558 align:middle line:84%
is being revamped
right under our noses.

00:11:09.558 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to,
right, let's go right into that

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:84%
after this, because
cryptocurrency is part of it.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I think what scares most
people about cryptocurrency

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
has been the historic
volatility of it.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So how does that
factor in Celsius?

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:90%
You just?

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Right.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you want, if you think
a certain crypto is going up,

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:90%
invest in it like Bitcoin.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So Bitcoin is, from the
beginning of this year,

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:84%
2020, has outpaced gold, has
doubled the value of gold

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:90%
in terms of return.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not comfortable,
because it does definitely

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:90%
go up.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It does,
oh, yeah, yeah.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Then just get
something called Tether,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:90%
which is called a stable coin.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
few stable coins.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:90%
USDC, USDT, which is the Tether.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is linked
to the dollar 1 to 1.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.200 align:middle line:90%
It never, it won't vary.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So you know for sure
that you put $100 bucks in,

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
$100 bucks coming out.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: The only difference
is, you get 8%, 9%, sometimes

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:90%
10% interest on it.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very cool.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: If you think
Bitcoin is going up,

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.483 align:middle line:90%
and I think it's going up.

00:12:07.483 --> 00:12:08.560 align:middle line:90%
We've begun the bull run.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.078 align:middle line:84%
I've been pretty dead
on about Bitcoin's.

00:12:11.078 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Astrologically.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Astrologically.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Charting it, yeah.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.322 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Sometimes to the day
about its movements up and down

00:12:16.322 --> 00:12:17.545 align:middle line:90%
this year.

00:12:17.545 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Some other things I
haven't been right about,

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.730 align:middle line:84%
but Bitcoin I've been
pretty accurate with.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I think the bull
run started July 24.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:90%
I predicted it would jump up.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:90%
It had a little rise.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:90%
It's continued to rise.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But I think Bitcoin's
bull run has started.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you like the idea
of putting $100 bucks

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:84%
in and maybe in a year or two
it it's going to be $200 bucks,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:84%
then you invest in
something like Bitcoin.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But if you're conservative,
you just put it into Tether.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Get $110 back.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And you get $110
back at the end of the year,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:90%
and it's compounded.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's compounded.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk
about, you're saying

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.850 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
astrology and looking

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
at it, that cryptocurrency
has looked like this might

00:12:55.030 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:84%
be the time to start taking
them more seriously as what's

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:84%
going to become a normal
part of our economic picture

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.277 align:middle line:90%
in the future?

00:13:04.277 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Well, yeah.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of, some of the
biggest investment firms

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:84%
are already on board,
spending hundreds of millions

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:90%
of dollars buying Bitcoin.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not the retail investor
like it was in 2017.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Retail, I mean you and I.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: It's the
big institutions

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:90%
that are gobbling up Bitcoin.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing it
behind the scenes.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, even back in 2018,
like Jamie Dimon, the big CEO,

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:90%
was saying Bitcoin is worthless.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:84%
But behind the scenes,
they were buying it up.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were investing.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So they do that, because
then later on, they'll say,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:90%
oh, we changed our mind.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.150 align:middle line:90%
And here, oh guess what.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:90%
We have some to offer you.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we own it.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So there's huge
institutional interest

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:46.810 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's going, it'll
never be mainstream,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.460 align:middle line:84%
because it's an alternative
to government money.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's becoming
more mainstream.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Robert Kiyosaki, the
Rich Dad, Poor Dad guy,

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:90%
he's more like rich grandpa now.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.002 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: But he's still
out there fighting,

00:14:03.002 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and God bless him, he's
doing a great service.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:84%
He has this thing where
gold and silver he says

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:84%
are God's money, because they
were here before we were here.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Right?

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:90%
They're in the Earth.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Dollars are government
money, because they're issued

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.677 align:middle line:90%
by a decree of the government.

00:14:20.677 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:90%
That's what the word fiat means.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the imperative
case, I believe in Latin.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Let it be made.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.598 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Someone says,
let's make $100 million,

00:14:27.598 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:90%
and it's done.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But Bitcoin is the
people's money,

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
because banks can't control it,
government can't control it,

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.090 align:middle line:90%
it's peer to peer.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is the financial
revolution that's

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.725 align:middle line:90%
coming in this outsider time.

00:14:40.725 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
a lot of people

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:84%
have been afraid to
even get into it.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Because like I said, of
this volatility and saying,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.588 align:middle line:84%
well, wait a minute, I
can't buy shoes with it.

00:14:47.588 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Can't
buy, yeah, not yet.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.047 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this is
important to know about.

00:14:51.047 --> 00:14:53.002 align:middle line:84%
This sounds like
Celsius is a real segue.

00:14:53.002 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: It is a segue.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
buy shoes with it.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a guy
back in, what was it?

00:14:58.010 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:84%
2014 or something,
who bought two

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:90%
pizzas with a bunch of Bitcoin.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
That Bitcoin is worth a
million dollars right now.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So you don't want
to buy anything with it.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Expensive pizza.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: It's a store of value.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.040 align:middle line:90%
It's like gold.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.495 align:middle line:84%
You don't carry out a gold
brick to the coffee shop and go,

00:15:14.495 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:84%
how much is, and they
shave off a little bit.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:90%
That's, keep the tip, right?

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:90%
And put it back in.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:90%
You don't spend it that way.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So Bitcoin is more
a store of value.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.640 align:middle line:84%
But some cryptocurrencies
are moving

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of being
able to be spent as currency.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.462 align:middle line:90%
So they're credit cards.

00:15:29.462 --> 00:15:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I've got one in my
wallet right now

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.530 align:middle line:90%
that you can spend your crypto.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:90%
But I don't use it.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to spend my crypto.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: I want it to
grow, because it's just

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:90%
in the nascent phase.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.590 align:middle line:84%
We are just beginning
the next bull run.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to talk a little
bit about how old school Warren

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Buffett's seeing all this.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:10%
So Warren Buffett
used to be very much

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:10%
against God's money, gold.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:10%
But they just revealed
that June of this year,

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.770 align:middle line:10%
he invested a lot
of money in gold.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
what I've read too.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.162 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So what that means,
is he has no confidence in the.

00:16:00.162 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Traditional market.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Traditional markets.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.352 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The government, yeah.

00:16:03.352 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: In traditional money.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So he's not behind Bitcoin,
but it's a matter of time.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.547 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:09.547 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Because he's a
very conservative investor

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:90%
and he does it old school way.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he's moving
away from fiat currency

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.540 align:middle line:90%
and the markets.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
He pulled a lot of money out
of some really solid companies.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I think he pulled all his money
out of like Southwest Airlines,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.370 align:middle line:84%
which is, if you're going
to have a people's carrier,

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:90%
people mover.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.155 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Hey, I like Southwest.

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do, too.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: I flew
here on Southwest.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I fly
them all the time.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, even that, I heard
even those conservative guys.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: And the banks.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the banks, yeah.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:90%
So he's clearly sensing.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: He's an
old and wise canary.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And we should listen
to him singing.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: But there
are many others.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Paul Tudor Jones, who is a
very well-known investor,

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:84%
he's allocating millions
of dollars into Bitcoin.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:90%
And people went, what?

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But now a bunch of
others have followed.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:90%
So it's happening.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So the goal of our
conversation here

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
is to give some
predictions, but also

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.189 align:middle line:84%
to help people kind
of empower themselves.

00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, and prepare.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: This is not
conspiracy theory,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:84%
this is not like wild crazy
talk meant to disempower you.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:16.523 align:middle line:84%
This is so you have
this in mind and you,

00:17:16.523 --> 00:17:18.565 align:middle line:84%
like if you know what the
weather is going to be,

00:17:18.565 --> 00:17:21.609 align:middle line:84%
and you got to drive
somewhere, well, you

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:84%
can put on good tires,
you can figure out

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
where the hotels
are along the way,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
you can prepare, rather than
just getting in and driving

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.650 align:middle line:90%
and you know.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.722 align:middle line:84%
So that's the goal here,
is to help empower people.

00:17:32.722 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are a lot
of creative solutions here.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:90%
We have friends, we have family.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
places to turn to.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:84%
People have churches
they can turn

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.752 align:middle line:84%
to and larger community
within those churches.

00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where
we have start really

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.900 align:middle line:90%
relying on each other.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Community
is the big thing,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.443 align:middle line:84%
and this is how
traditional cultures live.

00:17:50.443 --> 00:17:51.985 align:middle line:84%
It takes a village
to raise a person.

00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:53.008 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:53.008 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: The other
thing is, it makes

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
you really think about what
do you really want to do.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.163 align:middle line:84%
You've had this corporate job
that you hate, but hey, it

00:17:59.163 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
makes 100k a year, so
I'm not leaving that.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:90%
I hate it.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Hate the boss, hate my job,
hate the desk, hate the view.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have acid
reflux your waking hours.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Right.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm spending half of my
salary just on doctors.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: But still, it's
but now you don't have that.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:16.687 align:middle line:84%
You can think about, hey,
maybe I should be a gardener.

00:18:16.687 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's one
of those silver linings

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Never been a better time
to just be yourself,

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:84%
because the other
stuff isn't available.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you attract
the right friends.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.107 align:middle line:10%
And you yourself, when
you're not yourself,

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:10%
I've had those kinds
of jobs and you'd

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.315 align:middle line:10%
have to pretend to
be a certain person,

00:18:30.315 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:10%
and you attract people
who are, they're

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:10%
not really your friends.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And you're not,
and you're always

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:90%
vibrating a little stress.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.330 align:middle line:90%
You're like this.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:90%
And people sense that.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you do what
you're born to do,

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.460 align:middle line:84%
your Dharma, I write about
that in the Dharma books,

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:84%
you vibrate a
little differently.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.398 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, some people
are not going to like it.

00:18:49.398 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
lose some friends.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.920 align:middle line:84%
You're going to gain the
friends that are right for you,

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and the relationships
that are right for you.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So that husband or that wife
who thought you were here,

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:90%
this person, may go away.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.713 align:middle line:90%
But hey, that's probably better.

00:19:02.713 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Be who you are and you'll
attract the husband,

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:84%
wife, girlfriend, boyfriend
that is right for you.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And so people have to be
willing to come into a place,

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.227 align:middle line:84%
also of non-attachment,
because if you have a--

00:19:14.227 --> 00:19:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: It sounds simple.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --fairy tale life
all built up in your mind

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
as to how it's all supposed to
go and that is now crumbling.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think, I
feel badly for people

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:84%
who have extreme attachments
and concrete expectations,

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.962 align:middle line:84%
because this is not the time,
it's not appropriate really.

00:19:33.962 --> 00:19:36.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to work for you
in the time of the outsider.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.825 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that's what a
fairy tale life actually is,

00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:90%
is tremendous hardship.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.805 align:middle line:84%
Every fairy tale has
the wicked witch.

00:19:44.805 --> 00:19:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And how
do you defeat them

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:90%
through your genuine surrender?

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And help from
your community and so on.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or the handsome
prince comes and saves you.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: That's
true, that's true.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's another part.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But that part of the
fairy tale has been

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:90%
laid to rest for a while now.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: The handsome
prince or princess.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whatever.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Whatever.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:07.550 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.655 align:middle line:84%
Fairy tales, Grimm's fairy
tales always had some.

00:20:09.655 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Yes, and
you have to overcome.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Darkness

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: That
darkness to get to.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.958 align:middle line:84%
And usually at the end,
you're a different person.

00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's a hero myth, like
Joseph Campbell talked about.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Like "Star
Wars," which was built

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.700 align:middle line:90%
on Joseph Campbell's teachings.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:90%
You're not the same person.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Luke Skywalker is
not the same person

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:84%
at the end of "Star Wars"
that he was at the beginning.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: He is a wise
and different individual,

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.100 align:middle line:90%
because of those hardships.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's what a
real fairy tale is.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through
it to become who you are,

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:90%
who you're born to be.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is the time
of hardship right now,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.902 align:middle line:84%
especially Jupiter
and Saturn conjuct.

00:20:46.902 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us what this
means in layperson terms.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: In layperson terms, it
means it's a period of Adharma.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Adharma means a lack of, a
low point in righteousness.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So fake news seeming real,
real news seeming fake.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Truth and fiction
being mixed up.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And our not being able
to see the difference.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And in Sanskrit there's a
saying, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
which says the ability to
discriminate between what is

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.671 align:middle line:84%
and what isn't, what
is real, what is not,

00:21:25.671 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
is the prerequisite
of a spiritual being.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: You have to
have discrimination.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.723 align:middle line:84%
Not the discrimination
we talk about on TV.

00:21:34.723 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Discernment.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.133 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Discernment to say
this is real, this isn't.

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
don't, you're going

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.920 align:middle line:84%
to be led astray by the
next religious leader,

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.867 align:middle line:84%
political leader, fill
in the blank leader.

00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Next blogger.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.597 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Or you're
going to listen to me

00:21:50.597 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and buy Bitcoin when you
shouldn't and stuff like that.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Don't listen to me.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Don't listen to anyone.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.822 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We got a fix for
that at the end of the show.

00:21:56.822 --> 00:21:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: You your
discrimination to judge.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Even the Buddha said, he
said, don't listen to me.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Go out and test and see
if what I say is true.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Test it in your life.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Then come and listen
when you're ready.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
interestingly, I did

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.040 align:middle line:84%
a, since I last talked
to you, last interview

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.290 align:middle line:84%
we did, I did one
with Carl Calleman.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Calleman is more a
scholar of the Mayan calendar.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we're in
this descending phase

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness right now
and these waves, these wave

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.670 align:middle line:84%
patterns that give way to
not just disinformation,

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:90%
but mistrust of one another.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Not knowing who to
turn to, not knowing

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:84%
who's telling the truth, which
gives way to conspiracy theory.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And what he said that
I found so interesting,

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
is he said historically, when
that wave, when that occurs on

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:47.290 align:middle line:84%
that wave cycle and conspiracy
becomes the mass mind

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.450 align:middle line:84%
set, essentially mistrust
becomes the mass mindset, that

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.490 align:middle line:84%
precipitates the fall of
cultures and civilizations.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah, it can.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how does that
factor into what you're

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.257 align:middle line:90%
saying about this period?

00:22:59.257 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
You're saying the
same thing that he's

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:84%
saying right now about the
consciousness of the inability,

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
of people's inability to
discern right, truth, so forth.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And this also happened
20 years ago, by the way.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Right around 2001, when we
had the attacks on the towers,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.618 align:middle line:84%
and we had this great
big confusion about who

00:23:22.618 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:90%
are we going to go to war with.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.025 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of.

00:23:25.025 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It really gave birth
to popular conspiracy theory.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So we are in, that
cycle is repeating again.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And so every 20
years we get this.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's not every 20 years
with the same intensity.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's every 60 years.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, talk
about that, because this

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.670 align:middle line:90%
doesn't feel the same.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Yeah,
this is different.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is,
10 years from now,

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:84%
they'll, Jupiter and Saturn
will be opposite, which

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:90%
will give us a time of hope.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:90%
We can reflect back into this.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:84%
We can reflect on what
is real, what isn't.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now let's
have a bit of fun here.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
one of the things

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.690 align:middle line:84%
you've been playing
with, and that's

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.300 align:middle line:84%
why I said that in
our introduction,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.720 align:middle line:84%
is you've been playing
with lady luck.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yes.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.903 align:middle line:84%
And contrary to
popular belief, I'm

00:24:10.903 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:84%
going to say something a
little controversial here.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Everybody, everybody
on this planet

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:21.550 align:middle line:84%
has lucky times that
they can access.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
think, I'm just not lucky.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm not lucky.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:84%
I thought that
before, but I went

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.710 align:middle line:84%
into testing these lucky times
using astrological principles.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And I went on a site just to
play slots, because slots just

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.405 align:middle line:90%
don't require any skill.

00:24:40.405 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you might
say, oh, Simon,

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.863 align:middle line:84%
you're winning because
you're really good at poker

00:24:43.863 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:90%
or blackjack or whatever it is.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
No, this is just
pushing a button.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:90%
So as we were talking about.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And I will play
the lucky time, I

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.680 align:middle line:84%
will play the slots
before my lucky time hits.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.347 align:middle line:84%
Usually it's a five
to 10-minute window.

00:24:56.347 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:90%
It's tiny little windows.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So most of the time when
we go to the casino or we

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:84%
call the credit card company
to increase our balance or.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Limit.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Limit, we don't get it.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:09.420 align:middle line:90%
They say, well no, sorry.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But if we do it during
these little tiny windows,

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:90%
you have a boost.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.770 align:middle line:84%
You have a 10%, 20% 30%
chance higher of getting it.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:90%
And so I showed that.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So when my lucky time is
not, I push the button,

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:90%
lose, lose, lose, lose, lose.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And then my lucky time
comes, and I've already

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:84%
said, look, guys,
it comes at 9:16 AM.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as that hits,
watch what happens.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:90%
And we're doing it live.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And 9:16 hits and all of
a sudden, do-do-do-do.

You've been documenting
this with video, right?

00:25:38.157 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:90%

exactly this, right?

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah, OK.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.115 align:middle line:90%

00:25:44.915 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: These all have to
fit within the larger context.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:90%
What is the larger context?

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Is this a good day for you?

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And I teach that using
the Vedic astrology chart.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way to see,
is this a good day for you.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Boom, $250 bucks.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:90%
You see how we hit that?

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:90%
$25 buck.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.250 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:12.310 align:middle line:84%
To see whether this
is a, boom, $50 bucks.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:17.190 align:middle line:10%
Whether this is a good day
for you or a good week for you

and so on.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:10%
So these lucky times
work within that context.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:23.295 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're back.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So boring
for anyone to watch,

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.980 align:middle line:84%
unless you're interested
in this stuff.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:84%
But exciting to me,
because it shows

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.590 align:middle line:90%
astrological principles at work.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:90%
I like things that work.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:39.200 align:middle line:84%
To me, if I can't apply
astrology or philosophy

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.870 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of new age
wisdom to my own life,

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.350 align:middle line:84%
then I don't, my brain is
not big enough to hold it.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.130 align:middle line:90%
I need stuff that works.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:51.797 align:middle line:84%
And so I test these lucky times
so that you don't have to.

00:26:51.797 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:84%
When you initiate things
during lucky times,

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:84%
you have a little bit
better percentage,

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.580 align:middle line:84%
a little, like lady
luck is on your side.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:84%
She's right there with
you for those few minutes

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and she sprinkles a little fairy
dust and says, you'll be OK.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And then she goes
off to do her thing.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you've
been playing with the slots,

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.750 align:middle line:84%
because again, there's
no skill involved,

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:84%
this is luck, how
effective has it

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:84%
been for you in
terms of your wins

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.060 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing it
in that little zone?

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: When I'm disciplined.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, when
you're disciplined.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.425 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And go within
the little four,

00:27:19.425 --> 00:27:21.820 align:middle line:84%
five-minute window,
extremely effective.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But I have to see, how do I
know it's a four or five minute

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:25.570 align:middle line:90%
window?

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I've tested it six,
seven eight to 10 minutes

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:90%
and before.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:90%
And then I will lose.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
using your bank account

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:84%
as another kind of
beta test on this.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Yes, yes,
you're welcome, everyone.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a bit of a
risk taker by nature.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.330 align:middle line:90%
So I have done this with stocks.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.655 align:middle line:90%
So the moment you buy a stock.

00:27:42.655 --> 00:27:43.455 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA:

00:27:43.455 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON CHOKOISKY: Right.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Is also important.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Look, you may buy the best stock
in the world, Apple, whatever.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you buy it
at the wrong time,

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to see
the same gains from it

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:84%
as you would when you buy
during your lucky moment.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can do this
for anything that

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.420 align:middle line:84%
is related to you getting
something from the system.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: You know?

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, does it work for
love, does it work for?

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:90%
It could help a little bit.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Like if you want to
ask someone on a date.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's mostly
financial-related.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not a one stop
shop for everything.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.930 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that
works for everything .

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.345 align:middle line:84%
Don't trust anybody who's
telling you, buy my lucky thing

00:28:26.345 --> 00:28:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and you'll have great
luck for the rest

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.137 align:middle line:90%
of your life for everything.

00:28:29.137 --> 00:28:30.765 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't work like that.

00:28:30.765 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what about,
I mean, a lot of people

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.410 align:middle line:84%
would say, oh, I have a really
important meeting coming up.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:36.210 align:middle line:90%

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%

need it to go my way.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yes.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you can
manage to set the time?

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Well, here's the thing.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.658 align:middle line:84%
There is, you also
have lucky days.

00:28:42.658 --> 00:28:44.925 align:middle line:84%
So every month, this
is the cool thing,

00:28:44.925 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:90%
that it was a revelation.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Because again, I am not
by nature, a lucky person.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:84%
When I go to the casino or
do something, always lose.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:84%
But when I align, so everyone
has two lucky days a month.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Within that lucky day, if you
also schedule your lucky time,

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:90%
it's like really good.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: You're almost
guaranteed to get something.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So you've got two lucky days
a month with about an hour

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:90%
or two window on that day.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.993 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got a lucky
day every year that's based on.

00:29:16.993 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The big lucky day.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Movement of the sun.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Then you have a really
lucky day every four years,

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.480 align:middle line:84%
where Jupiter transits
certain points.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we're incorporating
all the planets.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a big mishmash,
but we're trying

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.450 align:middle line:84%
to put it all in
this app, so you

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:33.460 align:middle line:90%
don't have to know astrology.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a whole
lucky day, then on that day

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
you can plan things that a
five-minute window is not

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:90%
going to be good enough.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.320 align:middle line:90%
So weddings.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need
more than five minutes.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:48.815 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: You need more
than five minutes.

00:29:48.815 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You want to go to
one of those bi-monthly lucky

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:90%
hours.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: The lucky
hour, the lucky days.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you get a
lucky two weeks, when Jupiter

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.520 align:middle line:90%
transits a certain place.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.340 align:middle line:90%
And those are really good.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:90%
So we use them.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:84%
My students test with
scratch off tickets,

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.373 align:middle line:90%
with slots, things like that.

00:30:06.373 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Whatever is available.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anything that
doesn't require skill.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now what about,
OK, so you're doing this,

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:84%
but your person on the other
end of the deal or negotiation

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:90%
is in their unlucky time.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's a great question.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:25.180 align:middle line:84%
This represents you as the
agent trying to get something.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And so these lucky
times favor you,

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.930 align:middle line:84%
they don't favor the
bank, the casino.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The boss you
might be talking to.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: The boss
you might be talking.

00:30:34.545 --> 00:30:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So they favor the
person who is engaged

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:84%
in trying to extract
value from something.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:48.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't favor the bank, as
it were or the establishment.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the time, the
establishment is favored.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like the house is favored.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: The house, the
house, that's right.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So we're
trying to establish

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.160 align:middle line:84%
when you have an advantage
over the house basically.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we
had a conversation

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.120 align:middle line:84%
once before about this
when you were doing this

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:84%
with betting on teams, and
you were following the team

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.660 align:middle line:90%
astrology.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yep.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
really interesting,

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:11.980 align:middle line:84%
because there's more
psychology in it.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if this overlays

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:90%
with what we're talking about.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you said,
OK, I've got the school,

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start now, I want
to make $30,000 from this.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you put it in
motion, boom, bingo, bada-bing,

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.390 align:middle line:90%
you're making, you made $30,000.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But you tell the rest
the story for those

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.260 align:middle line:90%
that haven't heard this.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Well, the
rest of the story

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:84%
is, when I reached
that goal, my tips

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and tricks and my predictive
technique stopped,

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:90%
kind of stopped working.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
that other factor at work.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.493 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Yeah, this is
the spiritual factor.

00:31:45.493 --> 00:31:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Are you spiritually
aligned to take advantage,

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.010 align:middle line:90%
to profit from this?

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was with
my sports, that

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.010 align:middle line:84%
was sort of the end
of my sports wagering.

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Because it was leading me
down, it's a lot of work.

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:03.820 align:middle line:84%
You know this, Regina, from,
you've been in this world

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:84%
where you're watching 10
games at the same time,

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.728 align:middle line:90%
you're doing charts.

00:32:07.728 --> 00:32:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
that from my NBC days,

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:84%
just trying to watch
all these games.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: It's crazy.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:90%
12 hours a day.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how
you earn your living.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And I reached a fork in
the road, I said, look,

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.055 align:middle line:84%
I can earn a living doing this,
but I won't be able to teach,

00:32:20.055 --> 00:32:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I won't be able
to write books, I

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:22.090 align:middle line:90%
won't be able to do the stuff.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do your Dharma.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Do my Dharma.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear that
this wasn't the road.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It was fun, it was awesome,
I still have fond memories,

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:32.090 align:middle line:90%
but that was it.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And so my Dharma was, and
it was painful, by the way.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: To have a
parlay where I predict 12

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.920 align:middle line:84%
out of 13 teams right
and just the last team

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.920 align:middle line:84%
loses by one point, and
you go, oh, somebody's

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:90%
trying to tell me something.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And so now I've moved into doing
my Dharma, which is sharing,

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:90%
researching other techniques.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So the lucky times
does not require

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.105 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of sort of
spiritual alignment and faith.

00:32:57.105 --> 00:32:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
happens if you

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.620 align:middle line:84%
get into a mindset of
greed, and you say,

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm doing these
slots every day.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Every lucky time,
I'm on it, man.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Slots are designed
to take your money.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.853 align:middle line:84%
So with slots, if you break
even, even even, you're doing.

00:33:12.853 --> 00:33:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're going well.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: You're doing well.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But most people
aren't going to see it that way.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Right.

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're going
to want to make money.

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Right.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:84%
So don't play slots
to make money.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good, thank you.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: I used
slot to test this.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: To show you that
even a system that's rigged

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.732 align:middle line:84%
to take your money,
you can beat it

00:33:27.732 --> 00:33:28.940 align:middle line:90%
for a certain amount of time.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.273 align:middle line:90%
But it's like swimming upstream.

00:33:30.273 --> 00:33:32.110 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
tired after a while.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Use these techniques.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
just a proof of concept.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:35.625 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: It's a
proof of concept.

00:33:35.625 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Now if you love playing
slots and you do it anyway,

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:90%
well, go for it.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Do your thing.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's some people
in Vegas, ching-ching-ching.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
what they love doing.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And you go back eight
hours later, they're there.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Ding-ding-ding-ding.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So OK, use those times
to bet a little bigger

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:55.445 align:middle line:90%
during those times.

00:33:55.445 --> 00:33:56.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:56.245 --> 00:33:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Go to the quarter machine.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Go to the.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead of the
dime machine or nickel.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Oh, no, I
played minimum $2 a ring.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time
for quarter machine.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:08.110 align:middle line:84%
But that's why I also
lose money sometime.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.600 align:middle line:84%
No, but overall,
I'm in the black.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:84%
Even with slots, I've
done pretty well.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:14.139 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I haven't
made a fortune,

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:15.880 align:middle line:84%
but I've made a few
hundred bucks here,

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.389 align:middle line:84%
a few hundred bucks there to
show that, hey, this works.

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But use this to do the
things that you do.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're a stock investor, if
you are, I don't know, I mean,

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.800 align:middle line:90%
if you are.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like we
said, if you want

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.500 align:middle line:84%
to just have an important
talk with somebody.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Exactly.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:33.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have the luck
energy on your side.

00:34:33.203 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: We all did a
little sprinkle of luck.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
why I wanted to talk about

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.780 align:middle line:84%
this right now, because there
are many ways in which people

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.909 align:middle line:84%
are praying for any kind
of good luck right now.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:44.254 align:middle line:84%
And you're just loading it
a little bit in their favor.

00:34:44.254 --> 00:34:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And we
do, we can access

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.179 align:middle line:84%
the rhythms of the universe,
the rhythms of the cosmos

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:57.139 align:middle line:84%
to kind of, it's like birds
when they catch a thermal,

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:58.670 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to
flap your wings.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.980 align:middle line:90%
You're just ahh.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.352 align:middle line:84%
And these lucky times
are like little thermals.

00:35:03.352 --> 00:35:04.560 align:middle line:90%
They give you a little boost.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Right?

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And knowing where
they are, you decide

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.330 align:middle line:90%
what you want to do with them.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.460 align:middle line:84%
My job is to show you when
it's going to be for you.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.200 align:middle line:90%
No, that makes perfect sense.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if we
were all perfectly

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:19.553 align:middle line:84%
attuned with our
perfect tuning forks,

00:35:19.553 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:90%
we would feel these moments.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: We don't need it, yeah.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We wouldn't need it.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are people who are
that in touch with themselves.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:84%
They feel when there's
wind under their wings.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.810 align:middle line:90%
But not most people.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.550 align:middle line:84%
There's too much noise, too
much fear, just too much.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: I think almost
everyone has had moments

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
where you're like, I had a
dream this is going to happen,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.970 align:middle line:84%
or I have a feeling
this is going to happen,

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and it happens.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.940 align:middle line:84%
But that tends to be
the, that's not the norm.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.155 align:middle line:90%
That's the anomaly.

00:35:48.155 --> 00:35:50.030 align:middle line:84%
What I want to do, is
give you the lucky time

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.470 align:middle line:90%
so that becomes the norm.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Where you plug in.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And you know
what's going to happen

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.905 align:middle line:84%
and you know you're going
to get a good result more

00:35:55.905 --> 00:35:56.705 align:middle line:90%
often than not.

00:35:56.705 --> 00:35:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe I need
to look at my unlucky,

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.292 align:middle line:84%
you were just
speaking those dreams,

00:36:00.292 --> 00:36:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I have these dreams, some
dreams yesterday that

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.590 align:middle line:84%
were really interesting,
followed by right

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:07.530 align:middle line:84%
after I woke up, wrote a couple
things down on the computer,

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:84%
then closed my
computer, I was done.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:13.170 align:middle line:84%
After I closed the computer for
the first time in my awareness,

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that computer started
playing video.

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.450 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't a
video, it was an ad.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the words that came
out of my closed computer

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:24.010 align:middle line:84%
were, accidents happen,
but we're here to help you.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Wow.

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Turns
out I think it was

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.140 align:middle line:90%
an All State ad or something.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Mars Saturn are
squared right now, yeah.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, man,
was I careful.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I drove in some
alleys yesterday just

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:90%
to kind of get off the street.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, oh no,
you'll surprise someone

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.010 align:middle line:90%
when you come out of the alley.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really kind
of put me on my toes.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And that is, well,
it's right now in the sky,

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Mars and Saturn
are square, which

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:90%
is an accident combination.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh!

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: So, now it's
applicable to everyone.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everyone.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: But it
means if you're angry

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.640 align:middle line:84%
or if you have, you're thinking
about stuff and you're driving,

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.740 align:middle line:90%
you're more likely to mess up.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So all it means is,
just pay more attention.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:02.270 align:middle line:90%
You'll be fine.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to bring up
another little dream then.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, this was the dream
that just preceded it,

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.230 align:middle line:90%
which was interesting.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And I won't go into
details, but it

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.580 align:middle line:84%
was kind of how I was
doing in a spiritual study.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And it turned into a graph
chart and showing all this stuff

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.390 align:middle line:84%
up here, you're doing
great and everything.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And then it had a little
white box here that said,

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:21.750 align:middle line:90%
naivete, naivete.

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought like,
that was something,

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.212 align:middle line:90%
something was going on there.

00:37:26.212 --> 00:37:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So I waited until this
morning and I meditated on it.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And I bring this
up for a reason.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Right now is the time that
people are feeling angry,

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.470 align:middle line:84%
they're shutting down,
they're mistrustful.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And the message that
came through when I said,

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.430 align:middle line:84%
what did that mean,
it said naivete

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:90%
is in service of the soul.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.150 align:middle line:84%
It leaves you open to
what we're talking about,

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.880 align:middle line:84%
these updrafts, the
messaging from the soul,

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.160 align:middle line:84%
for new information to
come in without resistance.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.482 align:middle line:84%
And if you get burned here
and there because maybe you

00:37:53.482 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:84%
bought something that
you weren't shrewd enough

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.600 align:middle line:90%
to detect, it happens.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.100 align:middle line:90%
It happens to all of us.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But this notion of
staying open to life.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.570 align:middle line:90%
It's also called surrender.

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: And surrender
doesn't mean giving up.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:12.610 align:middle line:84%
It means knowing,
it means opening

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:16.880 align:middle line:84%
your armor a little bit, so that
you can let in, let people in.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Vulnerable,
be vulnerable.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: A little
bit of vulnerability.

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Be a little bit naive.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we all want to feel
like we've got some control

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:25.582 align:middle line:90%
over this out of control game.

00:38:25.582 --> 00:38:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: You want to
have a strong spine,

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:90%
but an open heart.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.088 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key.

00:38:30.088 --> 00:38:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a very
good way to put it.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, Simon, any final thoughts
on this for your own strategies

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.230 align:middle line:90%
for this period?

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.950 align:middle line:10%
Because we're in the outsider
period, first of all I'll say,

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.248 align:middle line:10%
people need to go and take
a look at "Dharma Types."

00:38:42.248 --> 00:38:43.790 align:middle line:10%
We've done a couple
of shows on this.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:44.150 align:middle line:10%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: "The 5 Dharma Types"
and how each one of those.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:47.948 align:middle line:84%
In one of our recent
interviews, we

00:38:47.948 --> 00:38:49.940 align:middle line:84%
talked about how each
one of these types

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.540 align:middle line:84%
fits in with this
outsider phase.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Yeah.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in
general, for all people,

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:58.160 align:middle line:84%
any kind of sage advice coming
from you as a practitioner

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.810 align:middle line:90%
of many lovely things?

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:01.957 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Well, the first
is, always do your Dharma.

00:39:01.957 --> 00:39:03.290 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer to everything.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Do what you're supposed to do.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.940 align:middle line:10%
The second is, I wrote a book
called "The Dharma Method"

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.230 align:middle line:10%
just recently, and
in that, I give

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.330 align:middle line:10%
11 things you can do every day.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:13.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: From when you
have your cup of water,

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:19.370 align:middle line:84%
speaking a little mantra
into it, a little prayer

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:20.210 align:middle line:90%
in any language.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Sanskrit, Latin,
English, Hebrew, it

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.920 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter, to
put some of that,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.640 align:middle line:84%
and then you put that into you
to reorganize the molecules

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.430 align:middle line:84%
in the water so they
help to organize you.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Little things like
that are free.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:37.970 align:middle line:84%
To getting up with the sunrise,
to creating a sacred community

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:41.350 align:middle line:90%
of people who will check you.

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Who will check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.040 align:middle line:90%
Who keep you balanced.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So my advice is, you don't
have to, if you don't want

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.730 align:middle line:84%
to talk into your
water, if you feel

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.233 align:middle line:90%
it feels weird, that's fine.

00:39:54.233 --> 00:39:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Practice some of the others.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Get up at sunrise.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big one.

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Right, big one.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Looking into
the sun at sunrise.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Get your
pineal gland balanced,

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:84%
because these are the
master glands here.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't,
your hormones

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:07.670 align:middle line:90%
are off for the rest of the day.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:09.255 align:middle line:84%
Of course you going
to feel crappy.

00:40:09.255 --> 00:40:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
harder to make it,

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.460 align:middle line:90%
harder to be equanimous.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But when you wake up with
the sun, that's great.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can't wake
up with the sun.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Fine, there are other
things you can do.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Eating a certain sattvic
diet, which I call.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.410 align:middle line:90%
And sacred movement.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.600 align:middle line:90%
So incorporating, do something.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do things
in a conscious manner.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Do something to
bring balance to your life.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.770 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't even
matter what it is.

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:39.290 align:middle line:10%
Just do something rather,
because people tend to go,

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:41.510 align:middle line:10%
oh my God, it's too
much, I can't, there's

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:10%
this conspiracy
and this, and Simon

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.360 align:middle line:10%
says we're all going to
go bankrupt and this.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Just do something each day.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Even use your
lucky times to plug

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.350 align:middle line:84%
into the universe and the
universe will support you.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do your
Dharma, Dharma supports you.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:40:59.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:84%
When you do Adharma, you
will pay the consequences

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:03.480 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.105 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow, but some point.

00:41:06.105 --> 00:41:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, I want to thank
you for your calming presence,

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and also for the fact that
you're willing to put yourself

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.530 align:middle line:84%
on the line in a lot
of different ways

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.802 align:middle line:84%
to kind of bring us these
opportunities to play with.

00:41:15.802 --> 00:41:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: I'm your Guinea pig.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You are.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Use me.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to be
your beta group, too, OK?

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON: Awesome.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, thanks so
much until next time.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SIMON: Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Simon.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Again, lots to take
away and play with.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.560 align:middle line:10%
You can go to Simon's
site at spirittype.com

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:10%
for more on that.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you haven't seen my
previous interviews with Simon,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.090 align:middle line:90%
that'll be a lot of fun.

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.850 align:middle line:10%
They're here in
the Gaia archives.

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.278 align:middle line:10%
And there, we get into
our Dharma type story.

00:41:38.278 --> 00:41:40.320 align:middle line:10%
So until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.440 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:90%
