00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.280 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a Rumi saying,
"The wound is the place where

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.900 align:middle line:10%
the light enters you."

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle line:84%
That best says what today's
guest, Sandra Ingerman,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:90%
brings to her shamanic healing.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Her new book, "The
Book of Ceremony",

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:84%
shares her life story and path
as a counselor, and healer,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:90%
and shaman.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:84%
It's been marked by very
stark events such as three

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.890 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences, which
most people at best get one,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:90%
and you had three.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And so many of the
people that sit with me

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
have had near-death
experiences, usually just one,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that really marked a
sweeping change in their life

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:90%
So you required three.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.220 align:middle line:90%
And they're all so odd.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
well, one it would

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
seem almost like your
little accident prone,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
but, obviously,
it's more than that.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's start out with
you as a little kid,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:84%
because you were very
sensitive little child.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And let's go into the
first time that your life

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:90%
was nearly snatched away.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, well, I grew up
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:10%
And I was this
incredible nature lover,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:10%
and I loved everything
about life, and the colors.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:10%
And I thought everything
was so beautiful.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And so, I was an odd child,
because I had a spiritual life

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.755 align:middle line:90%
as soon as I was born.

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did you get most
of your nature experience

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:90%
in Brooklyn?

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a lot of people think
that Brooklyn has no parks

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I would think it does.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we had some.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So you went to the
parks a fair amount.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>> We went to
parks, but I also--

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
little kids can create beauty
and magic out of everything--

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> One tree in the
neighborhood is enough.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have one tree in
front of my house that I sang

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.305 align:middle line:90%
to every day.

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's so sweet.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And would lay in the
backyard and sing to the moon,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and the moon would
sing back to me.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I just felt like
life was here to be enjoyed,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:84%
but yet, even at a
really, really young age,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:90%
I was aware of the suffering.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in an
immigrant neighborhood,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted to be
of some kind of help.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
seven years old,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.750 align:middle line:84%
surprisingly, right in
my house in Brooklyn,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:84%
people always asked
how did this happen

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:84%
in your house in Brooklyn,
a streak of lightning

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
came through the
window and hit me

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.242 align:middle line:90%
and threw me against the wall.

00:02:53.242 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> What are the odds of that?

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> What are the odds of that?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're impossible.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And I went unconscious,
and I came back,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and my mother was there.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said Mommy, I
died, Mommy, I died.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And she said, no, you didn't.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
any experience.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
There was no spiritual
experience for me,

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:84%
like later on of seeing
God and hearing the music.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.300 align:middle line:84%
But in shamanism,
shamanism being

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
a universal, spiritual practice,
dating back over 100,000 years,

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
one of the signs of a shaman
is getting hit by lightning.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And so at that time, I
didn't make any associations,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
but as I grew, I found that
I was so hungry for anything

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, anything
spiritual, and then

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:84%
when I was introduced
to shamanism,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
it was like oh my
god, that's it.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Being hit by lightning is
actually the sign of a shaman

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and that this was my
initiation on to a life path.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the next one of
these experiences, you drown.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, let's talk
about that one,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:84%
because that's a great
fear of a lot of people.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and that one really
opened up my life for me quite

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:90%
a bit.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I lived in the '60s, and I
did the whole '60s thing.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, we're going to
get into that big time.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So during that time
was when I drowned.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Some friends of mine
from the Haight Ashbury,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.840 align:middle line:84%
we went down to Mexico, and
we went swimming in the ocean

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
in Mazatlan, and there
was a really strong tide.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And the very last things I
remember was my friend Tubby,

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
who was like 300 pound Mexican
bandido, yelling at me,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
whatever happens,
Sandy, don't panic,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going in the water,
and I realize I can't breathe,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and I keep saying to myself,
Tubby said don't panic,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Tubby said don't panic.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
a tunnel opened up,

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and I followed out into
this gorgeous light.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And I came into a stunning
landscape, a garden,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:90%
and sat on a stone bench.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a territory that
doesn't exist on this planet.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the
most amazing music,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and then that was when I felt
all this pain in my chest,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and I had washed
up on the beach,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:90%
and people had brought me back.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
But really, experiencing that
peace, that unconditional love,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:84%
that sound of the universe
that music of the universe,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:84%
what is holding all
of us all the time,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that set me on a path
to want to know more,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and I was working at
San Francisco State,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and I came back,
and my boss said,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
you had a near-death
experience, and so--

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, why did he say that?

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I told
him what happened.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yeah.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And he started turning
me on to different books

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:84%
on near-death experiences,
and I ended up joining Ken

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Ring's organization for
near-death studies and helped

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:84%
other people with near-death
experiences understand what

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:90%
their experience was with them.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and it wasn't over yet,
but it's jogging my own memory

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
of an event that happened in my
own life that I always wondered

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
if it was a near-death
experience because I

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.190 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the grand
experience others had,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:90%
but it was drowning also.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember being
trapped under a log,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and it was slimy,
and I couldn't move.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been under, and
I thought, oh my god, I

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.140 align:middle line:90%
can see the sun.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.702 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.702 --> 00:07:05.535 align:middle line:84%
The breaking point of
the water, the surface

00:07:05.535 --> 00:07:09.360 align:middle line:84%
is only about a foot or two
away, I can see the sun.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Is this how it ends?

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything went black, and
my body popped up quite a bit

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:90%
downstream.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
happened, obviously.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I passed out or something
and must have gone limp,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and it must have
allowed the stream

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:84%
to take me wherever it
was going to take me.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what happened, but
I came out coughing obviously,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
very shaken up, but it
was just missing time.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's the way it was--

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>> The first time.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> When I was hit by lightning.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the story's not
over, because you also

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:90%
drove off a cliff.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:90%
You were having some hard times.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I also have stories
that you don't have there.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you can share them.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.730 align:middle line:84%
People love stories because we
like to see ourselves in it,

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and we also like to
see what's possible,

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and what's possible
to survive, you know,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.450 align:middle line:84%
the indominability
of the human spirit,

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and you certainly
represent that.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the time off the cliff.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I was working
for the Forest Service,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and I was up in Oregon, and
I was in a line of cars.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:90%
We were all going to work.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And some of the trucks
were going to fast

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:84%
through some of the
curves, and all this dirt

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:90%
came up into my windshield.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the best
driver in the world,

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.682 align:middle line:84%
and I did everything
you're not supposed to.

00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you probably panicked
and were startled by it all.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I slammed
my foot on the brakes,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and we went flying off
the cliff, five of us,

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:90%
and one tree caught us.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:90%
We rolled five times.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So I got the name
Rolling Sandy after that.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And we called AAA,
believe it or not.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.775 align:middle line:84%
AAA came a few hours
later and towed us out,

00:08:59.775 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:90%
and we got back in the car.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.942 align:middle line:90%
>> And everyone was safe.

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody was safe.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
We got back in the car,
and we kept driving.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And so then, I almost got hit
by about a 10 ton boulder.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Climbing Mount Shasta.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.370 align:middle line:90%
And that one was a big one.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I really almost died, and that
one took a long time for me

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.150 align:middle line:84%
to heal from, but
the message I finally

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
got of what all these
near-death experiences was about

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
was it was time to learn that
living life on Earth was good

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and to stop trying to
get out of my body.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.587 align:middle line:84%
And so Mount Shasta was
where I had that experience--

00:09:44.587 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us about it.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Of the boulder.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
We were climbing Mount Shasta,
and we had left base camp,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and this unbelievable
sound started

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:90%
coming from the distance.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And I say to my friend
I'm hiking with,

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:90%
do you know what's going on?

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, let's just
stand and wait and see.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I see
this boulder coming at me,

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's like it
was tracking me.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:90%
If I went right, it went right.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:90%
If I went left, it went left.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was wearing crampons
to help me walk in the ice.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I had to jump so hard to
get away from the boulder

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
that my crampon actually
got stuck up here.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:90%
That's how high I was jumping.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And so my crampon
got stuck in my shirt,

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hopping on one foot
while this boulder's tracking

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:84%
me, and I'm going,
I have to lay down.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I have to lay down.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.580 align:middle line:90%
I can't keep jumping.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And I go, oh my god, this
is going to hurt so bad.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but
it's going to hurt

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:84%
so bad for a
millionth of a second,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and I said that millionth of a
second is going to hurt so bad.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Please don't let this happen.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:90%
And it missed me by five feet.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And Mount Shasta is
actually my power spot.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I lived there back
in the 1970s and had

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:84%
unbelievable experiences,
meeting what I believe

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:90%
were the Lemurian people.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And I just had amazing
experiences hiking alone

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.330 align:middle line:84%
on the mountain,
and Mount Shasta

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:84%
was letting me know that I
didn't appreciate life enough,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and if I didn't
appreciate life enough,

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:90%
life was going to take me out.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.370 align:middle line:90%
Beyond interesting.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, I just came back from Mount
Shasta just a few days ago

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.457 align:middle line:90%
actually, and the people--

00:11:50.457 --> 00:11:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and I was only there
for a brief time.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.457 align:middle line:84%
I've been there a
number of times,

00:11:53.457 --> 00:11:55.790 align:middle line:84%
but just for a couple days,
no big hikes or anything.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But some of the
people I was around

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
these people that they

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
would run into there that seemed
out of place, out of time.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:84%
But they would have these kind
of interesting, intriguing,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:84%
or beautiful messages
they just kind of out

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:90%
of the blue drop on someone.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.530 align:middle line:90%
So what was your experience?

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:84%
When you say the Lemurians, who
did you perceive as Lemurians,

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:90%
or how did they appear to you?

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I loved hiking
in Mount Shasta by myself,

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and I remember it was
a really snowy day,

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and I was hiking alone, and I
sat down to just be embraced

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.460 align:middle line:84%
in beauty, and I started
hearing these bells ringing,

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and they were really clear bells
in the middle of the woods.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I was living there on and off,
so I was living with a friend.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't real grounded there.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know all the stories,
the myths, the history.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And so when I got back
down to town, and I said,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:84%
well, I was out hiking, and I
heard all these amazing bells,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and they said, oh,
that's the Lemurians.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
They're a race of people
that live under the earth.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that in what they
termed the city of Telos,

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.930 align:middle line:90%
the place called Telos?

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's thought
to be a city, a place,

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
called Telos, where people
come and migrate back

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:90%
and forth from the surface.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I've definitely
heard of that place,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:90%
but I hadn't heard the name.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.837 align:middle line:84%
It is a fascinating place if you
can have time to actually spend

00:13:33.837 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:90%
a lot of time there.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I've heard lore of all
kinds from the very lightest

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.690 align:middle line:84%
to some of the
darkness there, too.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:90%
Both.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Like Sedona, it
attracts the poles,

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, extremes, because
the energy is so potent.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so potent.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever that
pole is is amplified.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Just stay on the light side,
I guess, is the hint there.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we'll back up
again for a moment now.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, part
of the reason you

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:84%
were trying to escape your body
is because life was painful.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:84%
In your book, you said that
when you were around 13,

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
you really start
realizing were an empath,

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's where your
depression was coming from

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.860 align:middle line:84%
is you were actually taking
on everyone else's pain,

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:84%
like you said in your
neighborhood, right?

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:90%
I was one of those kids.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, my father had a mom
and pop store a few blocks

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:84%
from my house, and so I used
to go to the store after school

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.120 align:middle line:84%
sometimes to help out,
and I was just-- you know,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.750 align:middle line:90%
I was only about seven or eight.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be walking
down the street

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and people would just stop
me and say can I talk to you,

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and they'd start telling
me their problems.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I worked
at my father's store

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
from when I was like
seven, and there

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:84%
was this whole group of people
who only came in to talk to me.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:84%
They would have to buy
some things, so they would.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I even remember a nun coming in.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:84%
She came in every night
that I worked, and she said,

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:90%
you're such a special child.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.120 align:middle line:90%
I just come in to talk to you.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a capacity to listen,
and I have a capacity

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:84%
to be able to really feel what
somebody is going through,

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
the deepest place where
they're being touched.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And I realized when
I was 13, and I

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
was depressed all the
time, and I was going,

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:90%
I have a great life.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:90%
I love to play outside.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I love school.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Why am I so sad all the time?

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I was just
picking up on so many people's

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
pain, and I wasn't given tools
to learn how to work with that,

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.540 align:middle line:84%
you know, growing
up in a family--

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Who is, right?

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Where everybody's
just trying to survive.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So that became a
big part of my path

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.680 align:middle line:84%
was learning how to
be there for people,

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.040 align:middle line:84%
but not carry their
pain at the same time.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> But along the way while you
were still trying to adjust

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:84%
to this reality of yours, you
had what you call a functional

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:90%
nervous breakdown.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
When the Vietnam
War came around,

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:90%
it was just too much for me.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:84%
I was on Wall Street every
day, protesting, getting

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
hit by beer cans and gassed and
all the things that happened.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was only a teenager,
and I realized at that point,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I had no power to create
change, that no matter

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:84%
how much I disagreed with
something politically,

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I had no power to create change,
and that was the message I got.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did
at a survival--

00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm a survivalist.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:05.569 align:middle line:84%
I've come through a lot, and
I've come through really well.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I decided that for
my survival, it

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:84%
was just best not to know what
was going on in the world.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:16.099 align:middle line:84%
So I stopped reading
newspapers, and I

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:17.720 align:middle line:90%
stopped watching the news.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea who
the president was.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>> For 10 years.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>> For about 10 years.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Which I can't even fathom
how you could shield yourself

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.829 align:middle line:84%
enough to not hear
it in passing.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So you must have led a very
solo existence during that time.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I had huge community.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> How did not hear learn about
these things inadvertently?

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we weren't
talking about politics.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I can understand that.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And I worked at
San Francisco State,

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and I managed a Student
Learning Center.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was assistant manager
of a Student Learning Center.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
people I worked with,

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
he read the newspaper
every day, and so he always

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle line:84%
had that newspaper on his desk,
and so I'd just avert my eyes.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I got
interested, and I wanted

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:90%
to look at the front page.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And I glanced down at the front
page, and for the first time,

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:90%
I read the headlines.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, like a person going
through behavior training,

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
every day, I read another
headline and another headline

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:27.530 align:middle line:90%
til I was--

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> To re-engage with what was
happening on the exterior.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, in the
midst of all that,

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.217 align:middle line:84%
and you alluded
to it a while ago,

00:18:35.217 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
you were living in
the Haight Ashbury.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you were part of the
whole kind of free love or drug

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We were there
at the same time.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I was afraid of that culture.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I just rolled in little
bumpkin from Sacramento

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
going to a fashion institute and
had my little fancy clothes on.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then, I'd
go through the Haight Ashbury

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:84%
for some reason
or another, and I

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:84%
remember being so
frightened at how disorderly

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and out of control the
whole thing looked.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And also people
obviously checked

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:84%
out, a lot of glassy eyes,
and like where are they?

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And so you were living
it to heal something

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
or to avoid something, the
pain or whatever inside you.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Talk about it from
that perspective.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:90%
I never got it.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of a
natural fear of being--

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, I guess
that out of control maybe.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, what happened for
me was being in Brooklyn during

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
the '60s, that was
a drug culture.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And so that was when I
got introduced to LSD

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:90%
and psychedelics and marijuana.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I would have these
amazing spiritual experiences

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:03.890 align:middle line:84%
of how beautiful this planet was
and that our real destiny here

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:90%
was to be joyful.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But I was looking around
me at all these people

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
who were trapped in lives
that were meaningless,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and and that just brought
them to tears every day.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the crying I heard
growing up in Brooklyn.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt there had to
be another life somewhere.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:84%
There had to be people
living a different life that

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:90%
weren't so trapped.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I only had
stories to go by.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> About out west, where they
said all the fruits and nuts

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:90%
rolled.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I was born in San
Francisco, so I

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
mean it was just where I was
bathed in and was used to.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it had quite a
reputation in the rest

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, right.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I started to hear
about it, and so two of us

00:20:55.010 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:84%
decided to go out there, and
the other two people got sick.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up
going out on my own

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and not I mean-- my god,
talk about being ignorant.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:90%
I got an airplane.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought that Haight
Ashbury was going

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.100 align:middle line:90%
to be right after I got off.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.262 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know how to get
anywhere or where I was going.

00:21:17.262 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>> At least knew to hitch
a ride into the city.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I met a
couple of my airplane

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:84%
who took me in and
dropped me off.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I had heard about the
Good Earth commune,

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and actually a movie was
made about that Stacy Keach.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So I lived there
for a few years.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And the news didn't
hit Brooklyn yet

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
that the Haight Ashbury
had actually been

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:90%
buried in Golden Gate Park.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And so when I got there,
it was really dead.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:90%
It was deserted.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
There was a liquor
store on every corner,

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.740 align:middle line:90%
and everything was boarded up.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:84%
But there was still enough
of this energy, this desire

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:84%
of people to come together
in a different way

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and to live life
from a different way,

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
from an expanded state
of consciousness,

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:19.100 align:middle line:90%
from heart and love, not hate.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, interestingly,
even without it being Haight

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Ashbury, that was more the tone
of being in California at that

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.053 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:22:27.053 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, because I was part--

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd go see Janis
Joplin in the park,

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and I was fine with all
of that, all the music.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And you know, long skirts.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Women didn't wear bras.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.500 align:middle line:84%
We didn't wear bras at
the time and organic food.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It was the drugs, but then I
didn't really even drink coffee

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:90%
till I was over 40 or tea.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.540 align:middle line:90%
I just-- it didn't taste good.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:90%
None of that appealed to me.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I kind of just liked my mind as
it was, except for smoking some

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.330 align:middle line:84%
ragweed in the '70s, which I'd
just bake brownies, eat, laugh,

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and go to sleep, not
like what we have today,

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
not mind altering
in that day at all.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But it was a very
different thing

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
to choose to go into this deep
world of these mind altering

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:90%
drugs.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I always thought, gosh,
that's really courageous on one

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.542 align:middle line:84%
level, and I also thought,
that's really crazy on another

00:23:14.542 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know what
it's going to do to your brain.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:84%
For me, I'm such
a grounded person,

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:90%
I never had a bad experience.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I was really lucky I never
had a bad experience.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:35.150 align:middle line:84%
For me, what the draw was
and what the addiction

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
became for me was I would see,
no matter what drug I took,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
all I saw was God, and I
experienced unconditional love.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was shown how we could
have a different experience

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:90%
And so what happened for me is--

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
what year it was.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I was probably late
20s, early 30s.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I was at a Grateful
Dead concert in Oakland,

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and I was high on LSD, and
my kidneys were killing me.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And I stood there,
and I said to myself,

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Sandy, so everything
is God, everything is love,

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and you're hurting yourself
by taking these drugs.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Please get the message
and hang up the phone.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I did, and I
stopped taking drugs.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>> That's good, because you had
already got you were you were

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
connecting in the
most positive way.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:90%
And just as a kind of final--

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I ended up probably taking
all of those over time.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:90%
A little bit of--

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like once or twice,
just to see what it was.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad I did, and
it was the same as you.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything was filled with
light and color and wonderful,

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and one time, one dose of
ecstasy, and I was gone.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.480 align:middle line:84%
I was so out of my body, my
friend thought I was dead.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was just
having fun saying bummer,

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.193 align:middle line:84%
that he's so concerned,
I'm having fun out here.

00:25:03.193 --> 00:25:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
that's probably why

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do drugs is I'm
not that tethered here.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not that
grounded, and it just

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.272 align:middle line:90%
would not have helped things.

00:25:12.272 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Where if you were
already grounded,

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.070 align:middle line:84%
you needed to be lifted up to
see the beauty of what life

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:90%
really is.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:19.952 align:middle line:90%
>> I can understand that.

00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing that with us.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So OK, now let's get you
through to the point where

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Harner, Michael
Harner, where you

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
met Michael Harner, and then
the real shamanistic part

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:84%
of your life started
coming to fruition.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I went to San
Francisco State,

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and I got my BA in marine
biology, and then I realized,

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I really want to be
working with people.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up in a private
graduate school, California

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Institute of Asian Studies,
now California Institute

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:90%
of Integral Studies.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a tiny
school in the Mission

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:90%
District in San Francisco.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.260 align:middle line:84%
It was expensive, and so
I had to work two jobs

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:84%
to put myself through school,
and I was always burnt

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.350 align:middle line:90%
out taking 12 units a quarter.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And somebody came into the
office one day and said,

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.750 align:middle line:84%
a man's coming out
from Connecticut,

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a clue
what he's teaching,

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.300 align:middle line:84%
but you could get two
easy units if you sign up

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:90%
for this weekend workshop.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So I went running into the
registrar's office, put

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:90%
my name.

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even look at what
the title of the workshop was.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, two easy units.

00:26:33.044 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Two easy units, I put my
name down, and I showed up.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
It was Halloween of
1980 in San Francisco.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I showed up to this
Friday night session,

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and it was an anthropologist,
who's now deceased,

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Michael Harner,
teaching a course

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.380 align:middle line:84%
on what was called shamanic
journeying and shamanism.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And a shaman is a
man or woman who

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
goes into an altered
state of consciousness

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and has access to these
amazing helping spirits who

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
just want to guide us and heal
us and help us with our life.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I met my helping
spirit, and he just

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:84%
started answering all the
questions I had in life,

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:90%
and I was hooked.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there I was.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:84%
There's this disembodied spirit,
I'm laying down on the floor

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:35.330 align:middle line:84%
listening to some drumming,
talking to this spirit,

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:39.290 align:middle line:84%
telling me all the questions,
unanswered questions

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I have in my life
and what I need to do

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:44.970 align:middle line:90%
and why I'm having issues.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, this
is what I was looking

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.235 align:middle line:84%
for because I'd been looking
for spiritual practices because

00:27:53.235 --> 00:27:54.035 align:middle line:90%
of my--

00:27:54.035 --> 00:27:54.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Obviously.

00:27:54.835 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Opening experiences.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't find a path,
and shamanism gave me a path.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And so then, since 1980,
I've devoted every single day

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
to that path, which has taken
me through twists and turns

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and started with
shamanic journeying,

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:84%
but moved to teaching about
working with reversing

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:84%
environmental pollution,
to moving to teaching

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.430 align:middle line:90%
how to perform ceremonies.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And I became best
known for my work

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:38.310 align:middle line:84%
with helping people bring
back the parts of their soul.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Soul retrieval.

00:28:39.352 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Their vital essence.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I wanted to spend some time
talking about that actually.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's been
over 30 years of--

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Coming up on 40 years.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's coming up on 40.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
There's always another
door to walk through.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:58.730 align:middle line:84%
I haven't even begun to learn
about the power of this work.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's flowing into my
mind right now is I'm thinking

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:84%
that this was your path in a
very specific way through this

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:84%
man's view or lens of
shamanic work, right?

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is what flashed
in is throughout history,

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:18.260 align:middle line:84%
there have been these mystics
that have nothing to do with

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.320 align:middle line:84%
South America or
doing ayahuasca,

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:84%
because now shamanism and
shamanic work has very much

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.820 align:middle line:84%
become kind of conflated with
ayahuasca, South America,

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Central America, and
journeying, right?

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, people
like Hildegard of Bingen,

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.055 align:middle line:84%
for example, she
was a shaman, right?

00:29:38.055 --> 00:29:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, absolutely.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Meister Eckhart,
he was a shaman.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So there you're looking in kind
of classic mystical theology

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
or mystical Christianity,
and they've popped up all

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.230 align:middle line:90%
throughout every tradition.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.300 align:middle line:84%
There are people that
functionally would be

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:90%
called shaman, wouldn't they?

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.610 align:middle line:10%
Shamanism is much broader.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:10%
What's happening in today's
culture is we're so rational.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we like to put
everything in boxes.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And so shamanism has
been put in a box

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that either it's Native American
or it's South American, where

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:22.470 align:middle line:84%
my draw to shamanism
was Siberian shamanism

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.020 align:middle line:90%
and the Inuit tradition.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I know nothing about
South American shamanism

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and ayahuasca, but that
has not been my path.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:37.380 align:middle line:84%
But there's this box that now
everybody put shamanism in,

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and the word shaman itself
comes from the Tungus tribe

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:84%
in Siberia, and it's
actually a Tungus word,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and it means one who sees
in the dark, a healer,

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.170 align:middle line:90%
and one who knows.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And so there are so many
initiations to the path

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:07.470 align:middle line:84%
of shamanism that lead
people to have this ability

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:13.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to pull aside the
veils of the ordinary realms

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:84%
that we live in here,
where everything is

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:20.320 align:middle line:90%
two dimensional, really flat.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But when you lift the veils and
go into the unseen and those

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:90%
non-ordinary realms--

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> In the causal realms.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the dimensions
of reality, the spirits,

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:42.150 align:middle line:84%
the plants, the
crystals, the trees,

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:48.180 align:middle line:84%
who want to engage in our lives
and bring us into a whole new

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:52.920 align:middle line:84%
dimension of reality that has
nothing about how we're living

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:58.020 align:middle line:84%
life on Earth, there are places
that you can go to, and it

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:03.930 align:middle line:84%
doesn't take ayahuasca, it
doesn't take being a shaman

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:08.550 align:middle line:84%
from South America, although
their work is magnificent.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:10.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's magnificent.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But people from all over the
world, all walks of life,

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:84%
can be a shaman
when they've gone

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.710 align:middle line:84%
through the initiation that
brings them to one who knows.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And it just--

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:30.810 align:middle line:84%
it's heartbreaking to think
of how our minds have been

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.620 align:middle line:84%
funneled down such a narrow
chute of understanding

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.015 align:middle line:84%
and even the
perception of reality.

00:32:37.015 --> 00:32:40.830 align:middle line:90%


00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Most people live in
such a dry understanding

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:48.690 align:middle line:84%
of the world they're in, because
they haven't had the experience

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:84%
to blast open, to see everything
in its multi-dimensional full

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.830 align:middle line:90%
living color form.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:59.468 align:middle line:84%
All things have those dimensions
to it, not just humans.

00:32:59.468 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:84%
We think, oh, well,
we're multidimensional.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.140 align:middle line:90%
So is every planet.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.930 align:middle line:90%
So is the earth herself.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And being able to travel
into those higher realms,

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and to me, that's, I think,
maybe the most beautiful thing

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
about shamanic work
that people like you do

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and people who guide
others into this

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:19.210 align:middle line:84%
is to open up the realm
of beauty and possibility.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what happens is
that people don't only open up

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:29.430 align:middle line:90%
to a beauty of another world.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:84%
They open up to the beauty
of their inner landscape,

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:84%
because what's happening
now in the world

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.590 align:middle line:84%
we live in is life has
become meaningless.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, truly.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the differences if
you do go to a shamanic culture

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and the cultures in South
America that so many people are

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:55.800 align:middle line:84%
traveling to right now, what
they're seeing is a light

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:01.440 align:middle line:84%
coming out of these people's
eyes, a joy, a light,

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't matter how
poor they are and how much

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:84%
catastrophe they suffer
in their life, that joy,

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:14.340 align:middle line:84%
that light is always flowing,
and that's because what

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:21.210 align:middle line:84%
shamanism teaches us because
it's a nature based practice is

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that we have entered dimensions
inside of ourselves where we

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:32.969 align:middle line:84%
have these beautiful gardens,
a beautiful landscape.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we get in touch with
that beautiful landscape,

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.960 align:middle line:90%
we see beauty everywhere.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening right
now is because people feel

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:84%
life is empty, it's
meaningless, when they look

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.190 align:middle line:84%
through an empty landscape,
the inner landscape,

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:84%
there's no joy,
there's no light.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So they're searching where
will I find that light?

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Who can give me that light?

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And so people are running
to shamanic cultures

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:09.810 align:middle line:84%
right now without understanding
shamans can't give you

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.010 align:middle line:90%
that light.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:90%
You have to find it within you.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, now this will take us
right into soul retrieval, how

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:84%
we become fractured
over incarnations.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so the word soul that
I work with is soul is our life

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:90%
It's our essence.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.210 align:middle line:84%
It's that part of ourselves
that keeps us alive.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And in shamanic cultures,
it's believed that whenever

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.440 align:middle line:84%
we suffer an emotional
or physical trauma

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.990 align:middle line:84%
that a piece of our
soul actually leaves

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:48.320 align:middle line:84%
our body in order to
survive the experience.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So I always use
the same example.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure people are bored
of hearing a successful,

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.330 align:middle line:84%
but if I'm going to be in
a head on car collision,

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:59.960 align:middle line:84%
the very last place I want
to be at the point of impact

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.520 align:middle line:90%
is in my body.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and so our psyche has
this brilliant self

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:90%
protect mechanism.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:84%
You go away while the
trauma is occurring.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And so at that
point, we lose a part

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:17.090 align:middle line:84%
of their soul, our essence,
and it's through shock.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Anything that creates
shock causes soul loss,

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and so in our culture, emotional
abuse, sexual abuse, accidents,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:32.330 align:middle line:84%
surgery, drug addiction,
grief, alarm clocks

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.000 align:middle line:84%
going off too early
in the morning,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.080 align:middle line:84%
anything that causes
shock can cause soul loss.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And the symptoms of a
person who has soul loss

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.700 align:middle line:84%
are people who they don't
really feel like they're here,

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.910 align:middle line:84%
they feel more dissociated,
they're watching life

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.800 align:middle line:90%
like it's a movie.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Everybody seems to be
more engaged in life

00:36:54.950 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:84%
than they are, immune
deficiency problems, depression,

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:05.390 align:middle line:84%
suicidal tendencies,
anybody who says to me,

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel the
same sense, and they

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.850 align:middle line:90%
don't mean that in a good way.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And so from a shamanic
point of view, oftentimes

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.820 align:middle line:84%
those parts don't come
back on their own.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a
trained shaman to be

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:27.050 align:middle line:84%
able to travel into the unseen
realms, where that soul escaped

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:31.160 align:middle line:84%
to, track it down, and
say it's a new time,

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.130 align:middle line:84%
it's a new life, it's
time to come back,

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and to bring back the
gifts that the person maybe

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.970 align:middle line:84%
lost their ability to imagine,
their ability to trust,

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.510 align:middle line:84%
their ability to love,
their ability to laugh.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.910 align:middle line:84%
You bring those
parts back again,

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:52.640 align:middle line:90%
and you feel such a fullness.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.730 align:middle line:84%
When I first had my
first soul retrieval,

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:58.340 align:middle line:90%
I just felt this bliss.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of a sudden, I
was fully back in my body.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Colors were so bright.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I could hear things
in a different way.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to look at my life,

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:14.090 align:middle line:90%
and I was going, wait a second.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be doing.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.880 align:middle line:90%
This isn't healthy.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.530 align:middle line:90%
This isn't healthy.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you're fully
back in your body again,

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.270 align:middle line:90%
you make different choices.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we can look at what's
happening in the world

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:84%
right now is global
soul loss, because who

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.610 align:middle line:84%
would say that money is
more important than the life

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:36.440 align:middle line:90%
of living beings?

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.165 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is collective
soul loss when we--

00:38:39.165 --> 00:38:39.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:38:39.965 --> 00:38:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> When we make
choices out of greed.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> To support artificial
constructs instead of life

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:46.610 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I totally agree with you.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream one
time, which is brief.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.723 align:middle line:84%
I was in a car with my
father on a mountain road

00:38:54.723 --> 00:38:56.390 align:middle line:84%
like you're talking
about in the Sierra,

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:58.010 align:middle line:90%
one I've actually been on.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's frightening.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a
straight drop off.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a big old, like
an old Oldsmobile or Cadillac,

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:10.310 align:middle line:84%
just huge, with really
sloppy steering, you know?

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, I was driving my
father, and boom, off the cliff

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:14.390 align:middle line:90%
we go.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.150 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, darn it.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, I'll
just get out of my body.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So I climbed out of my body, and
I thought, oh my god, my father

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.000 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
get out of your body.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.375 align:middle line:84%
I have to go back
and go down with him.

00:39:28.375 --> 00:39:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And when it came
from that dream,

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I realized that's the grace
and what happens in real life.

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:90%
That is what happens.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I think very seldom
is anyone actually

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.270 align:middle line:84%
in their body at the point of
a real blunt trauma like that.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:42.110 align:middle line:90%
We're already out.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:43.470 align:middle line:90%
There's grace in all of it.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> There is grace.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But as you say, if
we're already out then,

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.340 align:middle line:90%
how does that trauma occur?

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Enough that we would
have soul loss.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.240 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.210 align:middle line:84%
If you climbed out before the
accident, before the trauma.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's the element
of shock, and again, shock--

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, in the
physical body, too.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>> In the physical body, and
what shock does for us is it

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:12.710 align:middle line:84%
dissociates us enough so that
we don't get that full impact

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:middle line:84%
of the pain, and that
actually allows us to heal.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So one of the controversies
I have with my students

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:26.240 align:middle line:84%
is when somebody is in
a really bad accident,

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:29.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, the whole community
wants to get together,

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and let's do a soul
retrieval for this person.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And yes, a soul retrieval does
need to be done for the person

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:42.500 align:middle line:84%
but not right after the
time of such a big trauma.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Give just a little space--

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's too fresh.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Of the psyche.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And then let's come in
as a loving community

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:53.128 align:middle line:90%
and do that work.

00:40:53.128 --> 00:40:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> So what does that look like?

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.000 align:middle line:84%
What does soul retrieval
in a group look like?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a soul
retrieval is where--

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.870 align:middle line:84%
in all shamanic work,
what's happening

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:07.220 align:middle line:84%
is the shaman does a
lot of preparation work

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to lift himself or herself
out of an egoic state

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.230 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
because the ego,

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:19.400 align:middle line:84%
the rational mind has
nothing to do with shamanism.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.370 align:middle line:90%
It's about our divine spirit.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And so we dance, and we sing
until our burdening thoughts

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and our anchoring thoughts
and who's Sandra Ingerman,

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
who's Sandra Ingerman.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:40.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really go
into an expanded state.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:90%
And from that--

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.478 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're
shifting frequencies.

00:41:42.478 --> 00:41:44.660 align:middle line:84%
The music, the drumming,
and the movement

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.610 align:middle line:84%
shifts frequencies
to another level.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And so shamanism is not
an out of body experience,

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.860 align:middle line:84%
because the shaman takes
his or her body with them

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.630 align:middle line:90%
into the unseen realms.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden,
your divine has come alive,

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and your divine can now meet
the divine of the unseen realms.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And that allows a flow
of energy to go through,

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.870 align:middle line:84%
where any kind of healing
forces could come in

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:26.690 align:middle line:84%
to help the planet, or
spirits can come through

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:31.100 align:middle line:84%
to show where that
piece of soul fled to.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.210 align:middle line:84%
If your whole soul
leaves, you die.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's a piece
of your soul, a fragment.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And so the spirits show you
where that soul fled to.

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And for me, at that
point, you never

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.490 align:middle line:84%
see two shamans work the
same around the world.

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So you can't say
how shamans work.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:84%
How I work is I pull with
intention that lost soul

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:03.590 align:middle line:84%
to me so I feel that frequency,
that invisible energy coming

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:90%
into form.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I get up and blow
into my client's heart center

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and into their crown with the
intention of really seeing

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:24.950 align:middle line:84%
every cell filling back up
with their divine light again,

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.330 align:middle line:90%
and they feel it.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:27.420 align:middle line:90%
They feel a difference.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I bet they do.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.070 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It might not be immediately.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.530 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it
takes a few weeks.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And some people, they have to
do emotional work before they--

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:84%
they've been so
out of their body,

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.380 align:middle line:84%
they can't feel
being in their body

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.140 align:middle line:84%
until they do some
integration work.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, since we're in
a big self-help DIY genre

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:54.980 align:middle line:84%
of information and such, how can
a person also maybe begin doing

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.190 align:middle line:84%
this on their own with
their own intention?

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Can people do their
own soul retrieval?

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, from a
shamanic point of view,

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:07.770 align:middle line:84%
shamanism dates back
over 100,000 years.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So we have to understand that
nobody's practicing shamanism

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.590 align:middle line:84%
like it was originally
practiced and that the reason

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.670 align:middle line:84%
it's been around for over
100,000 years is it works,

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:24.440 align:middle line:84%
because what spiritual practice
is alive after 100,000 years.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.277 align:middle line:84%
And it evolves to keep needing
the needs of the people

00:44:28.277 --> 00:44:29.360 align:middle line:90%
and the needs of the time.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And also to meet our level
of understanding in the time,

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:35.720 align:middle line:84%
because it has devolved
and then evolved,

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.850 align:middle line:90%
devolved again repeatedly.

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that practice has had
to go through those same shifts

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.710 align:middle line:84%
as the awareness has
changed over time.

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and so in classic
old time shamanism, people

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.350 align:middle line:84%
didn't do healing
work for themselves.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:57.440 align:middle line:84%
You went to the
shaman for healing.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.220 align:middle line:84%
In today's world, everybody
wants to heal themselves,

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:03.470 align:middle line:90%
like you said.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I tell people no, you
gotta go see somebody

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:07.050 align:middle line:90%
for soul retrieval.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And they go, no, I
want to do it myself.

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, try
it, but you need

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:16.070 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that you
feel results afterwards,

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:19.420 align:middle line:84%
because everything in
shamanism is about results.

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.490 align:middle line:84%
If the shaman couldn't
heal the people,

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.850 align:middle line:84%
if the shaman couldn't find
food sources for the people,

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.230 align:middle line:90%
the people died.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So this just wasn't an
airy fairy practice.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it was like
the druidic culture,

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:35.650 align:middle line:84%
the early druidic cultures, the
survivors of what many believe

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:38.920 align:middle line:84%
were Atlantis, when these
things were normal practices.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.770 align:middle line:90%
I was one of them.

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.645 align:middle line:84%
I used to practice these
things way back when

00:45:41.645 --> 00:45:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and remember some of the
incredibly beautiful ways

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:47.860 align:middle line:84%
in which we were able to bring
people back into wholeness,

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:52.340 align:middle line:84%
just using sun and light,
color and so forth.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And sound.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.182 align:middle line:90%
>> And sound, absolutely.

00:45:54.182 --> 00:45:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Is really big right now, too.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.165 align:middle line:84%
>> This was just a
normal part of life,

00:45:57.165 --> 00:45:59.860 align:middle line:84%
but here we are now
cut off from all that.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.620 align:middle line:84%
You can go to your HMO
if you have insurance,

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.103 align:middle line:90%
try to get fixed.

00:46:04.103 --> 00:46:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is a whole
different deal.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.510 align:middle line:90%
So we do feel very splintered.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:09.190 align:middle line:90%
We feel very individualistic .

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't feel part of
tribes that we're really

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.057 align:middle line:84%
part of a tribe or even a family
or even a group of friends

00:46:14.057 --> 00:46:14.890 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:18.700 align:middle line:84%
We're so isolated
right now as a species.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I
ask that question.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:23.200 align:middle line:84%
But we're always
surrounded by our guidance.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>> We're always surrounded
by our guidance,

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and so what I love to teach
is how to do ceremony,

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:31.510 align:middle line:90%
because you can--

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And that gets
us to your book,

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:35.440 align:middle line:84%
which has been so fun
just getting to know you

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and your path, but we still have
some time left, so of course,

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into
ceremony and your new book.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so ceremony
is a sacred act,

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and ceremony is where
we set an intention,

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and we move out of our
ego, as I shared earlier,

00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and we meet with divine forces
for the dream we want to pull

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:08.270 align:middle line:90%
from that world into this world.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And so ceremony ends up acting
as building blocks, where

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.330 align:middle line:84%
every time you
perform a ceremony,

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:19.450 align:middle line:84%
you're creating another building
block that's leading you

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.760 align:middle line:90%
closer to your dreams.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And I like to think of
shamans as gardeners,

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:27.310 align:middle line:90%
gardeners of energy.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:30.370 align:middle line:84%
That's all we're doing
is we garden energy.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And so with ceremony, you
can go into an altered state

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.620 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.420 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can.

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I've taught this to
fundamentalist Christians.

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:45.100 align:middle line:84%
There's no population I
haven't taught ceremony to.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And you open up
to the divine part

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:55.180 align:middle line:84%
of the world where through
your songs and your chants,

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.750 align:middle line:84%
whether it's calling
back your soul

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:04.000 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's breaking
the bad connection

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.800 align:middle line:84%
you have with others, really
unhealthy relationships.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're seeing so
much of it right now.

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> People are shattered
and disconnected.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So shattered
and disconnected.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Time to cut those cords,
time to cut those chords.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's time to celebrate
fall coming, the Equinox,

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and to give gratitude
for your life

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:36.550 align:middle line:84%
for it to perform a ceremony,
to bring meaningful work

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:40.810 align:middle line:84%
into your life or find a
meaningful path like we're

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:45.310 align:middle line:84%
talking about that takes
us out of the box of living

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:49.900 align:middle line:84%
in a world where our
senses are deadened.

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.560 align:middle line:84%
We can't we can hear the
songs of the universe

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.860 align:middle line:84%
without hearing them on
our devices, you know,

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:59.530 align:middle line:84%
where shamans hear the
songs singing through them

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:01.090 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it's through ceremony
by creating that intention,

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:11.950 align:middle line:84%
creating sacred space, calling
in your own divine spirit,

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:16.030 align:middle line:90%
calling in the spirits beyond.

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:21.790 align:middle line:84%
We end up creating bridges from
these non-ordinary realms where

00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:22.720 align:middle line:90%
we can--

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:29.140 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like a spinner spins
through a new fabric of life

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that we want for ourselves,
we want for our community,

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:38.360 align:middle line:84%
we want for all of life, and
we want for the planet itself.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about
some specific ways,

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.340 align:middle line:84%
because here in your book,
when we talk about the use

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:44.180 align:middle line:84%
of ritual, you go
into four areas.

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.200 align:middle line:84%
One is honor, giving
thanks, offering blessings,

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.750 align:middle line:90%
and asking for healings.

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's go with these as
some really basic elements.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, honor is something I
think that we're missing a lot

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:01.330 align:middle line:90%
of in our culture.

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:04.960 align:middle line:84%
We really dishonor
ourselves in our behavior.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:10.150 align:middle line:90%
We dishonor other life.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And so in ceremony,
it's really important

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:17.320 align:middle line:84%
to bring in what do you
honor and what are you

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.430 align:middle line:90%
grateful for about life.

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
calling in the wind

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.300 align:middle line:84%
instead of just--
in our culture,

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:29.110 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
are happening right now

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:31.450 align:middle line:84%
is because of all
the weather changes,

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:35.240 align:middle line:84%
people are commanding
the elements to stop,

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.500 align:middle line:84%
but they never started with
building a relationship

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.870 align:middle line:90%
with the elements as an ally.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So first, let's meet the
wind and honor the wind.

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Wind was actually the first
living being on the planet.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.500 align:middle line:84%
It was here before anything
billions of years ago.

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:58.280 align:middle line:84%
The earth is 4.6
billion years old.

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So when water-- the primal
seas are billions of years old.

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So when we start
bringing in the elements,

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:10.750 align:middle line:84%
because elements are such an
important part of ceremony,

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and the sun is actually the
youngest of the elements,

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.960 align:middle line:84%
you're connecting with a
4.6 billion year earth.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:24.460 align:middle line:84%
You're connecting with the wind
that's billions of years old.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Think about the stability
in destabilizing times.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Think about the feeling of
centeredness and stability

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:38.110 align:middle line:84%
that you feel if you
actually honor the elements

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and imagine the earth, 4.6
billion year old earth,

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.600 align:middle line:84%
working with you as
an outlier to make

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.850 align:middle line:90%
your dream come through.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So first you have to honor
the earth for helping you.

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.040 align:middle line:84%
You have to honor the animals
or that transcendent being

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.220 align:middle line:84%
or that angel or
god for helping you.

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Start with honor.

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Who do you honor?

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And your ancestors, they're
always watching your back.

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:13.630 align:middle line:84%
In our culture, we have
so much traumatic memories

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:18.310 align:middle line:84%
of our childhood and
stories about our ancestors.

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:22.990 align:middle line:84%
But in shamanism, your ancestors
are who have your back.

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Once they're
deceased, once they've

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:30.040 align:middle line:84%
made that evolutionary leap,
and they're in a new frequency,

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.900 align:middle line:90%
they want to see you succeed.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So how do you bring in the
ancestors to honor them?

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, honor
is really important.

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Honor is really important.

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you honor the ancestors
of the land and the land

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:51.730 align:middle line:84%
that you live on, all of
a sudden you have allies.

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So I was teaching
a soul retrieval

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:59.590 align:middle line:84%
training in Tennessee, and
it was during Hurricane Opal.

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And we were going to
do a fire ceremony,

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:05.830 align:middle line:84%
but there was this
hurricane, and we

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:09.490 align:middle line:84%
were going to do the
fire ceremony to release

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.950 align:middle line:90%
our greatest hurts to the fire.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.830 align:middle line:84%
We spent the day
making talismans

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:17.380 align:middle line:90%
to release our greatest hurts.

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what we were going to
do without the fire, well,

00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:23.790 align:middle line:84%
there was a little
fireplace in our room

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:26.230 align:middle line:84%
that was literally
about this big.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:28.100 align:middle line:90%
And you know, there were--

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:30.340 align:middle line:90%
it was a large group of people.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:33.640 align:middle line:84%
How were we all going to put
our talismans into the fire?

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, don't
worry about it.

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Every ceremony is perfect.

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.040 align:middle line:90%
It's all about intention.

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.340 align:middle line:84%
It's all about honor and
creating sacred space.

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's take this room we're
all going to have to stand in.

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:48.820 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to be able
to dance and drum and be

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.560 align:middle line:90%
in ecstasy.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And we start to build the
fire, and the hurricane stops.

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:58.270 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the
hurricane magically stopped.

00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So I said to everybody, take
a piece of wood and run,

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and we ran as fast as we
could, and we built this fire

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:12.580 align:middle line:84%
in this open gorgeous
meadow in the retreat center

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.140 align:middle line:90%
in Tennessee.

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And the second the last
person put in their talisman,

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.680 align:middle line:90%
the hurricane came back.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:26.320 align:middle line:84%
1 amazing the power and how
nature will work with us.

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But I think one thing that we
have often been overlooking--

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.590 align:middle line:84%
we talk about climate change,
we talk about earth change--

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Earth is going through
her own changes as well--

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:39.700 align:middle line:84%
is honoring the fact that
this earth is her own being,

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:43.510 align:middle line:84%
going through her own
processes of changing,

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:47.540 align:middle line:84%
transforming, elevating,
healing, just like we do.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And if it's disturbing
to us and if it's

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:52.480 align:middle line:84%
disturbing our
lifestyle, we need

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to sit back and have
a little respect.

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:59.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're a wonderful
co-creative guest with Earth

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.870 align:middle line:84%
and not be trying to
necessarily command or stop

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:07.270 align:middle line:90%
weather patterns and so forth.

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:09.850 align:middle line:84%
That has nothing to do with
artificially created climate

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:12.130 align:middle line:84%
change by the way
and what's happening

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:14.440 align:middle line:84%
there with chem trails,
contrails, and so forth.

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:18.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and have respect enough
to let her go through what

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.980 align:middle line:90%
she needs to as well.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And you could perform a ceremony
to honor that she is there.

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and you
talked about this.

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And to actually say
thank you to the earth,

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:36.930 align:middle line:84%
thank you for holding me, thank
you for all that you give me,

00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:45.030 align:middle line:84%
all the beauty, and that
it creates relationship.

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Human beings relate
to each other.

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.450 align:middle line:84%
They relate to their
pets, but they're not

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:53.470 align:middle line:90%
related to much outside.

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And when weather happens,
we take it personally,

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.880 align:middle line:90%
like someone's against us.

00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I just find it interesting
that we're so not a part

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.150 align:middle line:84%
of the very beautiful planet
that we're lucky enough

00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.950 align:middle line:90%
to inhabit.

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I was a firefighter temporarily
for the Fire Service,

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and I learned that fire is
the most healing thing that

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:16.170 align:middle line:90%
can happen to the earth.

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And so with my students,
I asked them to teach

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:30.600 align:middle line:84%
their children about the
healing of storms and fires

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:34.050 align:middle line:90%
and hurricanes, how--

00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I tell them to tell
their children,

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:40.260 align:middle line:84%
think about taking a shower
and being able to wash

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.570 align:middle line:90%
all the grunge off of yourself.

00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said that's
all the earth is doing.

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Shake it off.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> That's all she's
doing, and it gives--

00:56:49.050 --> 00:56:53.820 align:middle line:84%
instead of children being
so afraid of everything,

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.140 align:middle line:84%
it gives them a
different perception.

00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And when we change
our perception,

00:56:58.170 --> 00:56:59.730 align:middle line:90%
we change our reality.

00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, I so agree
with the notion not just

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.630 align:middle line:84%
of honoring, but I have
found on a personal level,

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:10.500 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing that takes
your frequencies higher faster

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.350 align:middle line:84%
than first thing in the
morning, taking the time

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:17.280 align:middle line:84%
to just allow yourself to
run through the gratitude

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.420 align:middle line:84%
list, everything
you're grateful for,

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and you realize you're
actually grateful for a lot.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And by the time the
day begins, foom,

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:28.380 align:middle line:84%
you have really ignited
a passion inside yourself

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.570 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't happen if
you're not grateful.

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And in shamanism,
there's the principle

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:40.020 align:middle line:84%
of sacred reciprocity,
and if you honor nature,

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.550 align:middle line:90%
nature will honor you in return.

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a wonderful
antidote in today's world

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:48.150 align:middle line:90%
to look out and not--

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:50.820 align:middle line:84%
yes, in is important,
but also look out

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and become grateful
for everything

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that life is brought to you
and all of the beauty that

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:58.800 align:middle line:84%
surrounds us, including grateful
for the parts of ourselves

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that are a little wounded, that
need a little bit of light.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Before we go very, very quickly,
you have beautiful Hathor

00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:05.730 align:middle line:90%
pendant on.

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about what
Hathor means to you.

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:14.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Hathor is
a mother goddess.

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:19.050 align:middle line:10%
She is an aspect of the
divine feminine that

00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:23.490 align:middle line:10%
brings so much healing
to the feminine,

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:29.130 align:middle line:10%
whether you're a woman or
a man, and in Egypt, women

00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:32.550 align:middle line:10%
go to the temple of Hathor when
they're trying to get pregnant,

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:35.370 align:middle line:10%
and they put their
hands on the temple

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:39.330 align:middle line:10%
and ask for help, a
blessing to have a baby.

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:43.080 align:middle line:10%
She's such a beautiful
aspect of the divine mother,

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:46.050 align:middle line:10%
and she brings so much
nurturance and beauty

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:50.910 align:middle line:10%
into my life and healing into
my life and healing into others.

00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:54.033 align:middle line:84%
>> And this you do for others,
so you pass the gifts along.

00:58:54.033 --> 00:58:55.200 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank you so much.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.760 align:middle line:10%
It's been a wonderful
conversation,

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.910 align:middle line:10%
such a very kind of serenely
passionate discussion

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:04.620 align:middle line:10%
about your life in shamanism.

00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.310 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate what you do.

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, and thanks
for the brilliant work that

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.460 align:middle line:90%
you're doing.

00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:10.830 align:middle line:90%
