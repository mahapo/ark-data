00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: The sad fact
is that more than half of all

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
first marriages dissolve in the
harsh reality of our own lack

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:10%
of understanding of what
it takes to make it work.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:84%
While we're chemically
wired to fall

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
in love, when those
chemicals wear off,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
we're not as well
equipped to stay together.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Arielle Ford's new book, "Turn
Your Mate Into Your Soulmate,"

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
goes into the study of how
people who stay together do it.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So I guess we're going
to learn from them.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:10%
And you're becoming one of them.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.896 align:middle line:10%
>> ARIELLE FORD: I am.

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Late to the game,
everyone has their own time

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:10%
and season, but nonetheless,
you're learning to make it

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:10%
work.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Absolutely.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.888 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's
start out with that part

00:01:02.888 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation because
that's not how you were

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:90%
naturally wired.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:10%
>> FORD: No, it was pretty
unpredictable that I'd be

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:10%
sitting here in this chair
today talking to you about this

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:10%
subject.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:10%
I was a first time bride at 44.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And I did not grow up in
a home with two people who

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:90%
really loved each other.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with parents who
actually hated each other.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And I have no conscious
memory of them actually

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:84%
ever holding hands, or
kissing, or being affectionate.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But when I got
married, what I quickly

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
discovered in sort of
a very shocking manner

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:84%
was that I had no
partnership skills.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I was really, really
good at being the boss.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I was used to
running a business.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But I had no clue how
to be a good partner.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:10%
And I quickly
decided that I needed

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:10%
to become a student
of love, that I

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.760 align:middle line:10%
had manifested this awesome
soulmate, this incredible guy.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:10%
He exceeded my expectations.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was blowing it.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's sort of the
beginning of the story.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and, you know,
we teach best what we need

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:90%
to learn.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's--

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: You teach what
you need to learn most.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And still, 18 years later,
I have learned a lot

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and I have a lot of tools and
tricks in my emotional toolkit.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And, still, the
thing that I found

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
is that even understanding
certain issues

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and knowing how to navigate
them doesn't make them go away.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.795 align:middle line:84%
It's a daily practice
of choosing to love--

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And choosing
to be loving.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I was one of these
people, like lot of people,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I thought love was
just a feeling.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, well, when
I'm feeling love, that's

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:90%
how I know that I'm in love.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you're married and
you've taken sacred vows

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and you've made this commitment
to another human being ,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
even if they're your soulmate,
there are days, weeks,

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
maybe months, when you don't
even like them very much.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:90%
And then you have to choose.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Love is a behavior.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.675 align:middle line:90%
Love is a commitment.

00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Love is a choice.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Love is a decision.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's work.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:90%
It really is work.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
I'm with my soulmate.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:84%
It must mean it's
going to be easy.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, a
happily ever after.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah, right?

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank God for
happily even after.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.460 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, it's interesting.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
I've looked around,
and throughout my life,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
at people who seem to
naturally be adept at making

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:90%
their relationship work.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And I actually
only seen a couple.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, if I'm being-- yeah,
if I am being honest, and I am,

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:90%
I've only seen a couple people.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
is a woman who is

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
a former sister in law
of mine whose birthday is

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:90%
February 14, Valentine's Day.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And this woman just has a
type of grace and enthusiasm

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
for life, where
she married someone

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:84%
who was her polar opposite,
the ballerina cowboy syndrome

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:90%
thing, and had six children.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And every day, still remains
a creative endeavor that she--

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:84%
that she is solely responsible
for, in terms of being the glue

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.810 align:middle line:84%
that family and
that love affair.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:90%
And it's still a love affair.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.733 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah.

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:20.273 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But that's the only
person I've seen that's really

00:04:20.273 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:90%
just known how to do it somehow.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: It's rare.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of friends that
are married to their soulmate

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.622 align:middle line:84%
and they still have to
work at the relationship.

00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so
much that we come in--

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and I really believe
soulmates come in together

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
with sacred contracts
to be together.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:84%
There's past life stuff,
and there's karma,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's choices that
we make in between lives.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, yeah, let's be soulmates
in this next lifetime and let's

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
set up these synchronicities
so we recognize each other.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And let's work out the fact
that in the three past lives

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
you betrayed me and we're
going to have betrayal issues

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have
so many kids together.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:90%
But we forget all that.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:90%
We meet them.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:90%
We fall in love.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:90%
We're in this euphoric state.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
We're in what I call the
socially acceptable form

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
of insanity,
because the dopamine

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and the adrenalin and the
oxytocin's all kicking off.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's great for
6 to 18 months,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.420 align:middle line:84%
until all the
chemistry goes away.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And, suddenly, this
person with which

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
you had such frequency
and synchronicity with

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:90%
is just a real human being.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, see, I've
always viewed that as the hook,

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.729 align:middle line:90%
as the soul's hook.

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The means of drawing
people together for either

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:84%
something very lovely,
creative, and pleasurable,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.260 align:middle line:84%
or for learning, which may
feel the opposite of that.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Both are equally as valuable,
but that chemical cascade

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.747 align:middle line:84%
I do believe is a projection
from the soul to say tt-tt-tt,

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:90%
don't go away.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: It's nature's trick.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:49.685 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Stay here.

00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a trick to keep
you together long enough

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to establish some other bond so
that you can dig down and start

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:90%
doing your thing together.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Exactly, yes.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So it can be tricky.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Because, a lot of times, like
when you say the chemicals wear

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:90%
off, it's what was I thinking.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, you weren't.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.655 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't your choice.

00:06:06.655 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: It had nothing to
do with rational thought.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.311 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, it didn't.

00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: But it's an important
piece of it because soulmates

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:84%
come together to heal each
other on the deepest level.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And as anybody interested
in personal growth knows,

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:90%
the healing part sucks.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't feel good.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not fun.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:90%
It's often painful.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Harville Hendrix, who Oprah
calls the marriage whisperer,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
he's one of the world's
leading marriage researchers.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about this one day

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and I said to him,
Harville, how do

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.440 align:middle line:84%
you know if you're in
the right relationship?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:90%
And he started laughing.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And when he stopped
laughing, he said

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
you know you're in
the right relationship

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:84%
when it starts off as a dream
come true and eventually

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:84%
devolves into your
worst nightmare.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that's my
observation and my experience

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:84%
as well, in that if you didn't
have that chemical cascade,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
saying, oh, my god,
this is just amazing,

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.285 align:middle line:84%
there is no incentive to
stick in with the situation.

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:90%
And you're in that state.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.705 align:middle line:90%
Water tastes wetter.

00:07:09.705 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.664 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Air smells sweeter.

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Everything
feels so good.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes away.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
big disappointment.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh, does this mean I
don't love him anymore

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:90%
or she doesn't love me anymore?

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is all of those
chemicals are still there.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:84%
They're now covered
up with reality.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I wrote "Turn
Your Mate Into Your Soulmate"

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:84%
was to show you how to
reignite those chemicals to get

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:84%
those feelings back
and to reenvision

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:90%
the relationship that you have.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Because as you
said in the intro,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows that 50% of
first marriages end in divorce.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.475 align:middle line:84%
What most people don't know is
that 64% of second marriages--

00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And it's--

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:56.074 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: 73% of third
marriages end in divorce.

00:07:56.074 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: So if you're looking
like the problem's over there,

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:90%
that's not true.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.685 align:middle line:84%
Because the person who's in
all three marriages is you.

00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And as
we'll discover later,

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's not even a problem.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's start out with
your definition of soulmate.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Because that means different
things to do different people.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah, it's true.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So my definition
of a soulmate is

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:84%
that it's first and foremost
somebody you can completely

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
be yourself with,
somebody with whom

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:84%
you share unconditional
love, and when

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
you look into their
eyes, you have

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:90%
the experience of being home.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:84%
And if you accept
that definition,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
then I want to expand
it even further.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
going to be talking

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
about romantic soulmates today,
but your kids, your parents,

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:84%
your siblings, your co-workers,
your best friend, your cat,

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.860 align:middle line:84%
your dog all are also soulmates
if they fit that definition.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And to take it even a
step further than that,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I would also say a
soulmate is somebody

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that you feel emotionally
and physically safe with.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in a
relationship where there's

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:84%
abuse, extreme addiction,
or really bad behavior,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:90%
I can't help you.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
This is why God
invented therapists.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:90%
You need professionals.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:84%
But for anybody else
who's bored, disappointed,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
frustrated, upset with
the mate that they have,

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I promise you, if
you're willing to sit

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
with us for a little while
longer and take some baby

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:84%
steps, it is-- it's definitely
possible to rediscover

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
the love, and the
passion, and the fun.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so this is
bringing a couple of questions

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:38.290 align:middle line:84%
One, we tend to-- we tend
to circulate within a given

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:90%
incarnation with a soul tribe.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:84%
So any time we run into the
member of that soul tribe,

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.885 align:middle line:84%
it has that soulmate
kind of feeling.

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Whether it's a
family member, friend, lover,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: The recognition.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.214 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The recognition.

00:09:52.214 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So that-- by virtue
of that alone,

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.189 align:middle line:84%
we're falling into karmic
patterns, incarnation patterns.

00:09:59.189 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that's
where that recogniz--

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.440 align:middle line:84%
so when people have that
instant recognition,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
you can pretty much guess you
have been traveling together

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: But the mistake a lot
of people make is they feel

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:84%
that connection,
that recognition.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a-- if
there's chemistry

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and there's some
sexuality there,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.679 align:middle line:84%
they leap to the conclusion, oh,
this must be my life partner.

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.115 align:middle line:84%
And that is not
necessarily true.

00:10:24.115 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to have a
sustainable happy marriage,

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
you need more than
the recognition,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:90%
more than the chemistry.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:84%
You need communication,
connection, compatibility,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and, most importantly, a
shared vision for the future.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
If you're somebody like me
who loves to travel the world

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and wants exotic travel,
and I fall in love with you

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're an
agoraphobic, we are not

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.612 align:middle line:90%
going to be happy together.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: So this is why it's so
important that you could lock

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:84%
eyes across a crowded
room, you are the one.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:90%
But don't get married tomorrow.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Spend a good solid year dating
and getting to know them.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And are they your
lifelong partner?

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Do they have that potential?

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.351 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And whatever it is
between you may well be cleared

00:11:14.351 --> 00:11:15.295 align:middle line:90%
within that year.

00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Acknowledged and
cleared within that year.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
through a marriage

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:84%
to figure that one
out necessarily.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:20.958 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Exactly.

00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Because, sometimes,
it's just you

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.694 align:middle line:84%
come together for a reason,
or a season, or a lifetime.

00:11:26.694 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about
another situation that I think

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:84%
probably everybody watching,
most people, at least,

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:84%
have had happen, where you're
somewhere and you meet a total

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.610 align:middle line:90%
stranger for about 15 minutes.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you know
everything about that person.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.830 align:middle line:84%
There's absolute unconditional
love there, everything,

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:84%
but it's really nothing more
than just a passing moment.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: It is.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
have to accept it.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet people will spend
years pining for it.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.864 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I met him, but he got on
the train and he got away.

00:12:00.864 --> 00:12:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think there's
a James Blunt song.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.405 align:middle line:84%
I think it was James
Blunt, about that.

00:12:04.405 --> 00:12:05.441 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah.

00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that's
because we live with the myth

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.759 align:middle line:84%
that we each only get one
big love in a lifetime.

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're
going to go into that.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back
to you and Brian.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.650 align:middle line:90%
So you're 44 years old.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:84%
You have no template for what
a relationship even looks like.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Chemicals
are cascading.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
You're having a lot of
fun, happily ever after,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and then the reality sets in.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:90%
How did this all work for you?

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:84%
How did it start-- how did the
disappointment start showing up

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:90%
for you and Brian?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Well, I started to
notice that very often he was

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:84%
saying to me you are
not listening to me.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And my immediate reaction
was to get defensive and then

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.435 align:middle line:84%
parrot back to him whatever
it was he just said.

00:12:47.435 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To show
you're smart--

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: To prove--

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And now
you've proven it.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But the truth was, and I
knew what the truth was,

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:90%
is I have a tendency to drift.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.220 align:middle line:90%
I am an oldest child.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:90%
I am a terrible listener.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:84%
My life is all about me
and what's in it for me.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Brian, on the other hand,
is the youngest child,

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:84%
whose deepest core need is to be
seen and heard and listened to.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And he's used to getting that
from everybody around him.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:90%
So we were perfect together.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Both of our childhood
issues were knocking up

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:90%
against each other.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't understand
it at the time.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I was just like what's
the matter with him.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he just said A, B, and
C. So that was the first thing.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
uncomfortable because I

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.120 align:middle line:84%
was hearing a tone in his
voice and seeing body language

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.420 align:middle line:84%
that I hadn't seen
18 months previously.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And I was disappointing him.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing I wanted
to do was disappoint him.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And then another thing happened
that in retrospect is very

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:84%
funny now, but at
the time, wasn't.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.513 align:middle line:84%
One day, I caught myself
like this in front of him.

00:13:51.513 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oops.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And I don't remember
what I was ragging on him

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:84%
about, but I saw myself like
this and I immediately stopped.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.460 align:middle line:90%
And I was embarrassed.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him the
next time this happens,

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and, unfortunately,
there's going

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
to be a next time,
could you just kindly,

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.990 align:middle line:84%
sweetly, gently say to me, "when
did Sheila enter the room?"

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, Sheila's my mother's
name, and I adore my mother.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:90%
She's very cool.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
But she can be very bossy
and overbearing, as can I.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:90%
And he was so cool about it.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:90%
He totally got it.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:90%
He said yes.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And the next time
I'm too patronizing,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:90%
you can call me Wayne.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:90%
That was his dad's name, right?

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So very quickly we
eliminated the possibility

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
of World War III because
we had these code names.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And even to this day,
occasionally, he'll

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.155 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, I can see
Sheila just walked in.

00:14:44.155 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: So that helps.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:84%
But I had been used
to running a business.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I was used to being the boss.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.201 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how unsexy
being the boss in a marriage

00:14:54.201 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.970 align:middle line:90%
I had no clue.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
I was living in my
masculine energy.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I loved being in my
masculine energy.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that when
you marry an alpha male,

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.032 align:middle line:84%
you can't have two men
in the relationship

00:15:06.032 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:84%
if you're ever going
to really get along.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.817 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is a big
problem in the west right now.

00:15:10.817 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Huge.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.858 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because women have
been on their own a long time

00:15:13.858 --> 00:15:14.615 align:middle line:90%
paying the bills.

00:15:14.615 --> 00:15:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:90%
I had studied Dr. Pat Allen.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I knew about masculine
and feminine energy,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
but somehow I didn't
think it applied to me.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
what I needed to do

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:84%
was that it was fine
when I'm running

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.660 align:middle line:90%
my business all day long.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I can be the boss.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.180 align:middle line:84%
But when I get home, I needed
to create a system to drop back

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:90%
into my feminine energy.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So I would come home and
I would take a bubble bath

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
or I would do some belly dancing
or I'd listen some music.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I would put--
put on fresh makeup.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And I would actually downshift
back into my feminine energy.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.340 align:middle line:84%
That's what I needed
to do now for Brian.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:90%
We had a business together.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:90%
So we'd go out to dinner.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And at 8 o'clock at night, he'd
start talking contracts to me.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And I like to say to
him, no, no, no, we

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:90%
can't talk business now.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:84%
I just spent an hour getting
out of my male energy head.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And as interesting
as you are, we can't.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we had to negotiate
that and it took about a year

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.580 align:middle line:84%
until we finally
got into a pattern

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.556 align:middle line:84%
where we could understand that
what we needed was polarity.

00:16:22.556 --> 00:16:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And we could shift
back and forth

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:84%
because he's very comfortable
in his feminine energy.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:90%
But that took time.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So it was learning
the stuff that I

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.850 align:middle line:84%
didn't know that I didn't
know was a process.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But, clearly, the
incentive was there for you

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:90%
to have this one work.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Well, not only that,
I quickly realized that if I

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't learn to listen to him,
he would need to find somebody

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:90%
who would.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.316 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:51.316 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And to
this day, I mean,

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:84%
we're together now
almost 19 years,

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:84%
there are still moments when
I have to remind myself, oh,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
you need to pay attention,
which means turning towards him,

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
putting my phone
away, listening,

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
even if it's not all
that interesting.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.217 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the time,
he's pretty fascinating.

00:17:09.217 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But there are moments where the
thoughts going through my head

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
is like, oh, I really
need to check my email.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:90%
But what is my commitment?

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.720 align:middle line:90%
My commitment is to be loving.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:84%
And what's the most loving
thing I can do in this moment?

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Give him my full attention.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Because what it's more
important than him?

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so now, from that
platform, I'm a good listener.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:90%
I can be a good listener.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:90%
I have to for a living, right?

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:84%
But in personal relationship,
it's a little bit different

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.800 align:middle line:84%
because, yes, I
can hear the words,

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:84%
but now your own programs are
running in terms of how you're

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.770 align:middle line:90%
interpreting these words.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:50.497 align:middle line:84%
So you may think you're giving
your full attention to someone,

00:17:50.497 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and I've done the
same thing you have,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Ms. Smarty Pants, you
know, playing back.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
I heard everything you
said, blah, blah, blah.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
You want to hear what
you said before that?

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Blah, blah, blah, you know, kind
of like if I were sitting here.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:17:59.984 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:17:59.984 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that
does no good at all.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Because, in essence,
what you're doing

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
at that point in terms of
not only being defensive,

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
but this is a really
big one between couples,

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.849 align:middle line:84%
you're really
trying to be right.

00:18:12.849 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about
what happens when either one

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:90%
of the people has to be right.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Sometimes you
have to make a choice.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to be right or
do you want to be loved?

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And often, for me,
in that situation,

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.384 align:middle line:84%
it means I have to
keep my mouth shut.

00:18:29.384 --> 00:18:30.883 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
like being right.

00:18:30.883 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: I love being right.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a home
where being right

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:84%
was really the highest
value, like, really,

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:84%
if you were right about
something, that was a big deal.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And I had to really
understand that being right

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.780 align:middle line:84%
often means making
somebody else wrong.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And if we're going to win
together in a relationship,

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.646 align:middle line:90%
then we both need to win.

00:18:55.646 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's a tough one
because this affects, I think,

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:01.952 align:middle line:90%
most people.

00:19:01.952 --> 00:19:02.535 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah.

00:19:02.535 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Most people want to
think they can walk away from

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
whatever the situation
is with a little dignity,

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:84%
feeling like they
weren't a total idiot.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I wanted to
bring that up because I

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.180 align:middle line:84%
know that is-- that's
a big point that you

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.696 align:middle line:84%
made in your book, is
the need to be right.

00:19:17.696 --> 00:19:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- let's
go back for a moment

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:25.420 align:middle line:84%
to-- give us a little bit of
the more technical definitions

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:84%
of these chemical cascades
and the phases we go through,

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:84%
so people can see themselves
and their relationships in that.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: You know,
Dr. Helen Fisher,

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:84%
who's one of the leading
researchers and anthropologists

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:84%
on love, has sort of outlined
the whole phases of where you

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:84%
have this infatuation,
and then you go into lust.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when all
the chemicals are going off.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually,
you go into reality.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But what she's
been able to do is

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:84%
she can take people and put
them in a CAT scan machine

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and ask them questions
about their relationship.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And by looking at the CAT
scan, tell you whether or not

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.570 align:middle line:84%
you're still in love, because
different parts of the brain

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.090 align:middle line:90%
will light up.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
The thing about that is that you
could be in the CAT scan today

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and not be in love, but
she could retest you

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:84%
in three months and you
could be in love again.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:23.557 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we can't trust our
feelings when it comes to love.

00:20:23.557 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Somebody asked me
the other day, well,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:90%
how do I know if he loves me?

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I can only
speak from my point of view,

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.420 align:middle line:90%
how I know Brian loves me.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I know he loves me because
when I injure myself,

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a klutz,
it happens often,

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I can see the
concern in his eyes.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And he'll ask me
right away are you OK.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And he'll come and help me
off the floor or whatever

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:90%
crazy thing that I've done.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Or if I'm having-- if I'm losing
it, which I do on occasion,

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
completely melt down and
lose it, he'll sit me down

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and he'll hold my hands.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And he'll remind
me what I teach.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, everything already is OK.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:84%
The problem's
already been solved.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:90%
We're in this together.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.310 align:middle line:84%
We're going to figure
this out together.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's a very
generous, loving gesture.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Exactly.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, for other
people, they don't

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.500 align:middle line:84%
feel loved unless
they're getting

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:84%
roses and candy and cards,
which is why I love that book,

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.085 align:middle line:90%
"The Five Love Languages."

00:21:24.085 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Because everybody--

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Shows it differently.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.005 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Differently.

00:21:28.005 --> 00:21:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Like, for me, if you are being
affectionate and touching me,

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:90%
that's how I feel love.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:84%
I have other friends
that need gifts.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:84%
For Brian, it's acts of
service and affection.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So it's a good fit.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Yeah, there's a
guy named Dr. Gary Chapman.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.616 align:middle line:10%
He wrote this great book,
"The Five Love Languages."

00:21:46.616 --> 00:21:49.980 align:middle line:10%
I highly recommend anybody
in any kind of relationship

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:10%
read this book.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we look at
the difference between male

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and female and what we
need from each other,

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and one of the points you make
in your book is that men tend

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
to, and these are
blanket statements,

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
but tend to value being
respected by the woman even

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.740 align:middle line:84%
more than being
loved by the woman.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Yes, actually, men
crave respect more than sex.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.557 align:middle line:90%
And most women don't know that.

00:22:19.557 --> 00:22:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: They need respect
and they need appreciation.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had a really
funny conversation

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
with my hairdresser
the other day.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Because he was--
he's doing my hair

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going off on book tour
and I tell him about the book.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:90%
And I know that he's divorced.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him why
did you get divorced?

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:90%
He said car keys.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.222 align:middle line:90%
It's like what.

00:22:40.222 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:90%
He said car keys.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Really, he said my wife and I
started this salon together,

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:90%
but she used to leave before me.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And three out of seven days,
she would take my car keys

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:84%
with her, which meant that I
had to be at the salon an hour

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:84%
longer than necessary while she
brought me back my car keys.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And she would never
apologize, and she never

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:84%
realized how
inconsiderate she was.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So, honestly, we got
divorced over car keys.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So then I said to him
tell me about the best

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:90%
day of your marriage.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And he lights up, and he said
I can tell you every detail.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:84%
He goes we were three years
into having our business open.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.030 align:middle line:90%
We were driving on the 8.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:90%
We were near the Clairmont exit.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And she turned to
me and she said,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Tom, I am so proud of you.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:84%
You've done such a great job of
making our business a success.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:90%
And you are such a good dad.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And I know I don't say it often
enough, but I really love you.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, tell me about
the worst day of your marriage.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:84%
He said I remember
like it was yesterday.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
We were driving down the 8, we
were in the exact same spot.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:84%
We were near the Clairmont
exit, and the recession

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.360 align:middle line:90%
had just started.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:90%
And our business was failing.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And she was screaming
at me telling me

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:84%
what an idiot I was that I
couldn't fix the business

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the recession.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.764 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
end of our marriage.

00:23:57.764 --> 00:23:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And I thought
what a telling story.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.810 align:middle line:84%
The thing he remembers
and values most

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:84%
was the love and appreciation
and acknowledgement.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
killed the marriage

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:90%
was the lack of respect.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Because
men need to win.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And we need to set
them up to win.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and here's the thing
a lot of people don't know.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:84%
A man can't be happy
unless his woman's happy.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can hear the
women in the audience

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:84%
saying but I tell them all the
time what I need to be happy.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And my answer to them is,
yes, and your shaming,

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and blaming, screaming,
yelling, bitching, moaning.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
he's not listening.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.365 align:middle line:90%
He can't hear you.

00:24:43.365 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
You become mommy,
and he tunes you out.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But there is a way to get all
your needs and desires met,

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:84%
but it requires a really
sweet tone of voice.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And you have to tell him what
it's going to provide for him.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.400 align:middle line:90%
So I have an example.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.525 align:middle line:84%
I have a story to share
about why this really work.

00:25:02.525 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So I can't tell you
how many women tell me

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
the thing that drives them
nutty about their husband

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:84%
is that they have
to constantly remind

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.670 align:middle line:90%
them to take the trash out.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So here's how you get them
to take the trash out.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.790 align:middle line:84%
The next time he does
take the trash out,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:22.460 align:middle line:84%
even if you have to remind him,
when he walks back in the door,

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.050 align:middle line:84%
walk over to him,
give him a big hug,

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and then whisper in his
ear you are my hero.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I am so grateful to
you for taking out

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:90%
that stinky, smelly trash.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand touching it.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea
what it does for me

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and how sexy it is when
you take the trash out.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, he's
never ever going

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:84%
to forget to take
the trash out again.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:90%
He just had this big win.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, the opposite to
that, the way women end up

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.130 align:middle line:84%
really having men
lose all the time,

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and this may come
as a surprise, is

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:84%
that any time you put yourself
down to your guy, he's losing.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.875 align:middle line:90%
Because he chose you.

00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And if you're--

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.124 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
diminishes both of you.

00:26:11.124 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I've
got too many wrinkles.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.600 align:middle line:90%
I've got cellulite.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:90%
I need to lose 50 pounds.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And any way that you're making
yourself smaller, he's losing.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:29.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I did this little
pilot show on men and love.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was myself guiding
the panel of three men,

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:90%
of different age groups.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:84%
One was from Europe, the
other two were American.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting was
at the very end of the program,

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I said what I think I'm hearing
here is that, in the end,

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:53.976 align:middle line:84%
you-- it sounds like you need
women more than we need you.

00:26:53.976 --> 00:26:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were all say-- they
said almost simultaneously yes.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.119 align:middle line:90%
We're here to serve you.

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And no one, I mean,
starting the conversation, A,

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have suspected that.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And, again, this goes back
into the archetypal energy

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.430 align:middle line:84%
of being the hero,
needing to be the hero,

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:84%
or you wouldn't
incarnate as male.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Incarnate as a
female, if you don't need that.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, looking
along these lines,

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
if we're constantly
making someone wrong

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and diminishing
ourselves, that takes away

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:84%
the potential to be
the hero, which is

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.920 align:middle line:90%
a very natural state of being.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Yeah, and the other
thing that a lot of women do is

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.220 align:middle line:84%
they give too much, and
they don't raise the bar

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.139 align:middle line:90%
for the guy.

00:27:37.139 --> 00:27:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.210 align:middle line:84%
I tend to be kind of more in
that category of just flowing

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.610 align:middle line:90%
energy out and being an enabler.

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh, don't worry,
sweetie, it was tough.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: No, they--
they want to win.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:90%
They want to prove themselves.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So you got to raise
the bar for them.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:90%
What could they do for you?

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.295 align:middle line:90%
You know, and let them know.

00:28:00.295 --> 00:28:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, like I said,
it's the tone of voice

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's the way
that you say it.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And you only want to make
one request at a time.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.032 align:middle line:90%
One, or one question at a time.

00:28:10.032 --> 00:28:11.615 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Don't lay
down a manifesto.

00:28:11.615 --> 00:28:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Right/
We can multitask.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.950 align:middle line:84%
We can handle multiple
things at a time.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:16.690 align:middle line:90%
They can not.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Their brains are
wired differently.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a question, ask
one question and then shut up

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and give them all the time they
need to answer the question.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have a request,
make one very clear request

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that they can think
about and answer.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Or you can tell them.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.409 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
tell me right now.

00:28:35.409 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:84%
You could tell me
in a couple of days.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But I'm really thinking it might
be fun next weakened that we

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:90%
go skiing up in snow mass.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But don't overwhelm
someone with your list.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And no less
in a nasty tone of voice

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:90%
or a blaming tone of voice.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It's going to kill
the relationship.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:90%
So I think we've got that part.

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, you also say that a woman
cannot expect a man to know

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.710 align:middle line:84%
what her needs are, just
intuit what her needs are.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.525 align:middle line:90%
He's focused on what he's doing.

00:29:00.525 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.691 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you talk about
a woman named Elizabeth who was

00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:05.720 align:middle line:84%
proactive and wrote
her own user's manual,

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.607 align:middle line:84%
which I think is
a brilliant idea.

00:29:07.607 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Because for her, love meant
getting lots of little cards,

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and flowers, and candies.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And even though her husband
told her all the time

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that he loved her, she
needed this demonstration.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So she eventually
wrote, you know,

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.040 align:middle line:84%
the owner's manual for Elizabeth
on how to make her happy.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And then she said
very specifically put

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:33.490 align:middle line:84%
in there what kind of flower
she wanted, what kind of candy.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This was
super proactive.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:10%
>> FORD: So that-- because he
did want to make her happy,

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.670 align:middle line:10%
but how would he know that
tulips were her favorite,

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:10%
and that she particularly
liked red and purple tulips,

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.560 align:middle line:10%
or whatever it was.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.770 align:middle line:90%
So she got very specific.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.610 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's a great idea.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what about in the
notion of the beginning of what

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:84%
looks like it could be a-- I
don't like the word serious--

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.980 align:middle line:90%
but a lasting relationship.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.440 align:middle line:84%
What if everybody
was proactive enough

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to say-- to present
the other one with,

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.200 align:middle line:84%
as you say, like
a user's manual,

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
saying this is where
I really trip up,

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
hurts my feelings.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.170 align:middle line:84%
This is what makes
me feel great.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you had the advantage
of that knowledge--

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Well, I actually wrote
that book and I give it away

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:90%
for free as a bonus package.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:27.222 align:middle line:10%
If you buy this book and you
go to MatetoSoulmate.com,

00:30:27.222 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:10%
you can download "The
Everything Book."

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And "The Everything
Book" is a fill

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:84%
in the blank book for couples
to fill out and exchange,

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
so you have all
this information.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think
it's a great idea,

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:84%
to instead of just shooting
in the dark and each hoping

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.540 align:middle line:84%
the other one perceives
things correctly.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a crap shoot that way.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're all filtering
the information

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.390 align:middle line:84%
through our own lens
of experience, which

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.862 align:middle line:84%
you can say one
thing, but you're

00:30:53.862 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:84%
interpreting-- you're
interpreting what they're

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.944 align:middle line:90%
saying totally differently.

00:30:56.944 --> 00:30:58.123 align:middle line:90%
So it's very confusing.

00:30:58.123 --> 00:30:58.914 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: It can be.

00:30:58.914 --> 00:30:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In the beginning.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: But that's sort of
the point and the purpose

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:02.481 align:middle line:90%
of the whole thing.

00:31:02.481 --> 00:31:07.450 align:middle line:10%
So Harville Hendrix believes
that we have a built in mate

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.660 align:middle line:10%
selector and that
it's not random

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.220 align:middle line:10%
that we run into our
soulmate, that we actually

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:10%
pick the perfect person for us
who's going to have the owner's

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:10%
manual to all the buttons
to all our childhood

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:10%
wounds, to bring them up, so
we can become whole and healed.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And he says that's the
real purpose of marriage,

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.850 align:middle line:90%
that it's absolutely normal.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we live
like, oh, when there's

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:84%
bumps in the road
in the relationship,

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:37.432 align:middle line:90%
that something's wrong.

00:31:37.432 --> 00:31:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: When the
reality is, it's normal.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
Jill Mangino's story.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going
to talk-- I love

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.170 align:middle line:90%
learning by way of example.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was
just a fascinating story.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.787 align:middle line:90%
She's a lovely lady.

00:31:52.787 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:90%
So Jill's a good friend of mine.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And she had many
long-term relationships

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.220 align:middle line:84%
with guys that
were just like her.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.510 align:middle line:84%
They wore organic
cotton clothing,

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and they did yoga every
day, and juice fasts,

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.710 align:middle line:90%
and they were vegans.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
difficult relationships

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.170 align:middle line:90%
and never made her happy.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Finally, she moved back to
her hometown in New Jersey.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:84%
She went to her 20 year
high school reunion.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.130 align:middle line:84%
She ran into her high
school boyfriend, Ray.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.750 align:middle line:90%
And they started dating.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And then they fell in love, and
then they moved in together,

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and then he proposed,
and she took the ring.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So every time I
would talk to her

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.070 align:middle line:90%
I would say when's the wedding?

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And for the first four,
years she would say, oh,

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm just too busy.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:38.480 align:middle line:90%
We haven't planned it yet.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.350 align:middle line:90%
There's no rush.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's
talk about Ray's reality

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:42.990 align:middle line:90%
and personality.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: I'm going to get there.

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All right.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: After the fourth
year, I said to her tell me

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.200 align:middle line:90%
what's really going on.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.520 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell me you've
been so busy for four years

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't
plan a wedding.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.880 align:middle line:84%
She said Ray's not
spiritual enough.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what
do you mean by that.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, you know, I'm a
vegan chanting yoga green juice

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.040 align:middle line:90%
fasting kind of girl.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I know all about you.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you
don't know about Ray

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.470 align:middle line:84%
is that he repairs
motorcycles for a living.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:90%
He smokes cigarettes.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.990 align:middle line:90%
He smokes pot.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:90%
He's a meat eater.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.480 align:middle line:90%
He actually hunts all the time.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't
meditate, and he doesn't

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:21.670 align:middle line:90%
read Deepak Chopra books.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's just not a good fit.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, eventually, she
broke up with him.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.947 align:middle line:84%
But because the
recession had hit,

00:33:29.947 --> 00:33:31.280 align:middle line:90%
they were still living together.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't
afford to move out.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, she
got very, very sick.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And he took very,
very good care of her.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And after she got better,
she was in the kitchen

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:84%
one morning making her chia
seed gruel with almond milk

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.460 align:middle line:84%
that she does, and he walks
in through the back door

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.670 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of dead
turkeys, and his hunting

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.710 align:middle line:84%
dog, and his rifle,
and his camo wear.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And she says to him, oh,
hi, how was your morning.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said to her,
oh, it was beautiful.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.945 align:middle line:84%
I was walking through the
forest as the sun was filtering

00:34:02.945 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:84%
through the leaves, and I
could hear the leaves crunching

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.210 align:middle line:90%
under my boots.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a really
magnificent, divine morning.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And Jill's thinking
to yourself, wow, that

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.699 align:middle line:90%
even sounds kind of spiritual.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:16.280 align:middle line:90%
And then she forgot about it.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And then later that day,
he came home from work.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.719 align:middle line:90%
And he was in tears.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.409 align:middle line:90%
She's like what's the matter.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And he said Bob died.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Bob was his boss, the owner
of the motorcycle repair shop.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And he was really
upset about it.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.179 align:middle line:84%
And he said the
funeral's in two days.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.699 align:middle line:84%
And he goes you know how
socially phobic I can be.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Will you go with me?

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.179 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yes, of course,
I'll go to the funeral.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:39.540 align:middle line:90%
So they go to the funeral.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.960 align:middle line:84%
There's 300 people
there, mostly bikers

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.500 align:middle line:90%
in leather jackets, that crowd.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And the minister gives a eulogy.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.639 align:middle line:84%
And when he's done,
he says, is there

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:53.239 align:middle line:84%
anybody who would like
to come up and say

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:55.449 align:middle line:90%
a few words about Bob?

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Nobody room-- nobody
moves, dead silence.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And all of a
sudden, Ray gets up,

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:84%
socially phobic Ray gets up,
walks to the front of the room,

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and he starts talking about
what a good man Bob was,

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.590 align:middle line:84%
what a good father, a good
husband, a good community

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:17.550 align:middle line:84%
citizen, what a good
boss, what a good friend.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:90%
And Jill starts to cry.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And she falls in love
with Ray all over again.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And she realizes
that she has been

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:84%
the spiritually arrogant one,
that she's been judging him

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
by this criteria,
when, in fact, here

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.920 align:middle line:84%
is this open-hearted generous
man who's been treating her

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:84%
like a queen for years
and she's been judging him

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:84%
because he hunts, and he
smokes, and he rides bikes,

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.000 align:middle line:90%
and he doesn't do juice fasts.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So they are now very
happily married.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad to
report that when

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I ask Jill the other day who's
your guru, she said to me

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Ray's my guru.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, this
brings up a good point.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Ever since the addition of
new age culture to society,

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.349 align:middle line:84%
it seems to have almost
created a greater divide.

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It hasn't done
what it was supposed to do,

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.400 align:middle line:84%
which is to create
bridges to one another.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.074 align:middle line:84%
It's created a tremendous
amount of spiritual arrogance.

00:36:20.074 --> 00:36:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: And judgment.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And judgment.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And the truth is
men experience and express

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.220 align:middle line:84%
spirituality
differently than we do.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So we may want to sit in the
Mile High Church or the Unity

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Church and read certain books.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And if your guy is
coaching Little League

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:84%
in volunteering at Big Brothers
and helping your mother get

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.810 align:middle line:84%
in and out of the
car, and just being

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:45.980 align:middle line:84%
an all around good
human being, what could

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.930 align:middle line:90%
be more spiritual than that?

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And yet, when
I talk to single women,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.050 align:middle line:84%
the first thing they say is, oh,
well, I want a spiritual guy.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.549 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've
heard this so often.

00:36:55.549 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And most of those people
actually are alone.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.790 align:middle line:84%
They're alone with
their conversations

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.040 align:middle line:84%
with God books, and their
workbooks, and their practices,

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.160 align:middle line:90%
and their chanting.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I had this conversation
with Elizabeth Gilbert,

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.950 align:middle line:90%
who wrote "Eat, Pray, Love."

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her what do you
love most about your husband.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
my history was

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:84%
to be with guys who would go
to meditation retreats with me.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: She said but my husband
is never going to do yoga.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.140 align:middle line:90%
He's never going to meditate.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.840 align:middle line:84%
He's certainly never
doing a green juice fast.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.060 align:middle line:84%
But when I walk into
a room, his eyes

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:84%
light up like it's
Christmas morning.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And he takes me by the hand
and leads me into the kitchen.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And he puts my feet up and
he hands me a glass of wine

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:90%
and then he cooks me dinner.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's divine, right?

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: And she's happy.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And she understands that she
is a meditating, chanting,

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.320 align:middle line:84%
green juice fasting
kind of girl.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.660 align:middle line:90%
And he is not.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.790 align:middle line:90%
But he loves her.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.540 align:middle line:90%
He's devoted to her.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:90%
He's crazy about her.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:90%
And who wouldn't want that?

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And yet, by most people
standards, is he spiritual?

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, in his own way,
because he puts all that love

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:84%
in the food which he feeds
to her to nourish her body

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.870 align:middle line:90%
and soul.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm to the point
where I can barely stand

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.910 align:middle line:90%
to hear that word anymore.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.579 align:middle line:90%
Are you a spiritual person?

00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're alive.

You're walking on the planet.

00:38:19.578 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:90%
You have passions and loves.

Yes, we don't need to
be asking that question.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:84%
But to define it so narrowly,
to, as you say, chanting,

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.630 align:middle line:84%
and yoga, and green
juice fasting,

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:33.060 align:middle line:84%

vegetarian for 20 years

and started having lot
of health problems.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was very judgmental
about meat eating and all that.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I go back to becoming
essentially a carnivore

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.920 align:middle line:90%
to support my own health again.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.940 align:middle line:84%

And I was doing it only for

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Well, I-- I believe
that the past, the present,

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and the future are all
happening right now.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So we can talk about
it as a past life,

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.430 align:middle line:84%
but it's really more
like a parallel life.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.860 align:middle line:84%
But as we talked about
earlier, we have a tribe

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and we have recognition when
we connect with our tribe.

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe
when we're planning

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.690 align:middle line:84%
to hook up in a particular
lifetime with a soulmate

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:48.540 align:middle line:84%
that we go to a place that
they call recognition school

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and we plan out the coincidences
and the synchronicities,

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.530 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
recognize each other.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:59.100 align:middle line:84%
We can fall into nature's
trick and be crazy in love

00:40:59.100 --> 00:40:59.980 align:middle line:90%
and see this.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So that we can get
together and grow and heal

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.250 align:middle line:90%
each other as a couple.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's an
important piece of it.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And you do not have to
believe in any of this

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.892 align:middle line:90%
to manifest a soulmate.

00:41:12.892 --> 00:41:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.387 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:14.387 --> 00:41:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: It's just
my personal belief.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to-- I was going
to have you tell me-- tell us

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.944 align:middle line:84%
about Donna Eden
and her mate, but I

00:41:22.944 --> 00:41:25.110 align:middle line:84%
want to get into some of
the more functional aspects

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:25.410 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:27.076 align:middle line:84%
If we have time, we'll
go back to Donna.

00:41:27.076 --> 00:41:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Because what she and her
husband David represented

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.080 align:middle line:90%
is irreconcilable differences.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there are many
reasons people come together.

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they come together
to create or produce something,

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.890 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a child,
whether it's a pottery shop,

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual school, whatever.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:84%
They're here for
purpose together.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean it's going
to be the easiest ride.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Well, there's
a guy named Dr.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:55.320 align:middle line:10%
John Gottman who's a marriage
researcher at the University

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.680 align:middle line:10%
of Washington.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.470 align:middle line:10%
And he's just a total genius.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:10%
He's actually-- he can observe
any couple for 15 minutes

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.200 align:middle line:10%
and tell you within 93%
accuracy whether or not they'll

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:10%
be divorced in three years.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And what his studies
have found is that every

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.220 align:middle line:84%
couple, not just some,
but every couple,

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.390 align:middle line:84%
has a minimum of nine
irreconcilable differences.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:21.750 align:middle line:84%
These are things on
which you are never

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.990 align:middle line:90%
ever going to agree on.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So knowing that, then
how do you co-exist?

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.850 align:middle line:84%
With respect, and love, and
appreciation for each other,

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to
communicate well,

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to create what
he calls creative solutions.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.579 align:middle line:84%
So one example of that, also
came from Harville Hendrix,

00:42:41.579 --> 00:42:43.620 align:middle line:84%
because we were having
this conversation one day.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
creative solutions,

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.600 align:middle line:90%
that sounds like a good idea.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Give me a concrete example.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.650 align:middle line:90%
He said I've got one for you.

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:53.680 align:middle line:84%
He said my idea
of the perfect day

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.400 align:middle line:84%
is to get behind the
wheel of a vehicle

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and then drive for
eight or nine hours.

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Helen, his wife and partner,
her idea of a perfect day

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:07.410 align:middle line:84%
is to stay home and do
needle point or knitting.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are two
very different things.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, how did
you solve that one.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And he started to laugh and
he said we bought an RV.

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:18.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm always driving and
she's always home, knitting.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:21.934 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: So it
requires some effort.

00:43:21.934 --> 00:43:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
creative, that's good.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.058 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And it's
not a compromise.

00:43:25.058 --> 00:43:25.705 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:43:25.705 --> 00:43:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: I don't
like compromise,

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:30.020 align:middle line:84%
because you both
lose in a compromise.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.620 align:middle line:84%
But there are ways
for everybody to win.

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's
simple as learning

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.700 align:middle line:90%
to grow a generous heart.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So I've always-- I hate
to use the word hated,

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.000 align:middle line:90%
but hated sports on TV.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.160 align:middle line:84%
That was like a thing I
never ever wanted to do.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was part of my
whole deal breaker thing.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I was not going to marry a guy
who watched football on TV.

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So I marry a former
basketball player.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know about basketball.

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Now, he loves basketball.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.010 align:middle line:84%
His whole family
loves basketball.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.497 align:middle line:84%
I never even knew
what basketball was.

00:44:02.497 --> 00:44:04.080 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, you
know, this has been

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.330 align:middle line:90%
a big part of his entire life.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I could just watch
the last quarter of a game

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.695 align:middle line:84%
with him when it's
important to him.

00:44:11.695 --> 00:44:13.682 align:middle line:90%
And so I started to do that.

00:44:13.682 --> 00:44:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And I still didn't like it
and I still didn't get it.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Until, one day, I'm watching
the last quarter of a game,

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:22.330 align:middle line:84%
and I notice that
this really short guy

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.330 align:middle line:90%
is making all the points.

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said to Brian
who's that short guy.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, that's
Avery Johnson.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.890 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the best
players in the NBA.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:32.612 align:middle line:84%
And then the light
bulb went off and I

00:44:32.612 --> 00:44:35.260 align:middle line:84%
thought I'm going to always
cheer for the shortest

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.020 align:middle line:90%
guy on any team.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I got
skin in the game.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I learned
to love basketball.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Because it was important to him.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, for Brian,
he's a movie buff.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.750 align:middle line:90%
He loves movies.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And he likes really serious,
intellectual movies.

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.700 align:middle line:84%
My favorite movie of all
time is "Legally Blonde."

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I like a stupid, funny movies.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So he grew a generous
heart by always taking me

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.390 align:middle line:84%
to any movie I want to go
to, even though he'd never

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:05.840 align:middle line:84%
go alone to see "Beverly Hills
Chihuahua," another favorite

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.900 align:middle line:90%
of mine.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.140 align:middle line:90%
But that's what you do.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.850 align:middle line:84%
You learn to love what
your beloved loves.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of
the-- some of the-- this

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:19.860 align:middle line:84%
is Dr. Gottman, again,
kind of deal killers,

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and that is criticism,
contempt, defensiveness,

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:25.500 align:middle line:90%
and stonewalling.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Yes, he calls
them the four horsemen

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.205 align:middle line:90%
of the apocalypse.

00:45:28.205 --> 00:45:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: So when he's
observing a couple,

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:34.690 align:middle line:84%
one of the things he looks
for, if either party is rolling

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:38.150 align:middle line:84%
their eyes, that is
a sign of contempt.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.410 align:middle line:90%
That's very disrespectful.

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And that the
marriage isn't going to work.

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody--
if your partner's

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:46.890 align:middle line:84%
being super defensive or
they're stonewalling you

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and they're refusing
to engage, that's

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.450 align:middle line:84%
when you know you
need to go to therapy.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Reading a book is not
going to fix this.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.610 align:middle line:84%
You need to be with
a professional who

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:57.580 align:middle line:90%
can guide you through it.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, on the
other piece of it,

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.970 align:middle line:84%
one of-- another piece of
Gottman's amazing research

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:04.960 align:middle line:84%
is that he noticed the
couples that do really

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:09.480 align:middle line:84%
well always practice
what he calls bidding.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you turn your
body towards your partner

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and you look them in the
eyes, you are bidding them.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:19.320 align:middle line:84%
You are putting your presence
and attention on them.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And they know it and
they can feel it.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And another thing I
just learned yesterday

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.050 align:middle line:84%
is that as you're
doing this, if you're

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:29.030 align:middle line:84%
looking into their
left eye, then you're

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.860 align:middle line:90%
connecting on the heart level.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So anytime you want to have
a really deep conversation

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.450 align:middle line:84%
with anybody, gaze
into their left eye.

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK,
thank you for that.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And I have read that before,
very interesting and useful.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Also, another thing
along that line, and then

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I went to get into the
rebuilding, and the oxytocin

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:51.990 align:middle line:84%
development, and all
that, after the love

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:54.910 align:middle line:84%
seems to have gone,
Harville Hendrix,

00:46:54.910 --> 00:47:00.950 align:middle line:84%
he termed criticism as an
actual act of violence.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.131 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let's
talk about that.

00:47:03.131 --> 00:47:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Because people think
it's natural to be bitchy

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.110 align:middle line:84%
or hurl a little something
at someone, which

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:10.410 align:middle line:90%
I find personally devastating.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Harville says that
there's no such thing

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:18.590 align:middle line:84%
as constructive criticism,
that all criticism is

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:20.340 align:middle line:90%
a form of violence.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And he requires his
students to take a vow

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:28.280 align:middle line:84%
to be not critical with each
other, to be not judgmental.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, we have to have
serious difficult conversations

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.050 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And so there's lots of little
tips on how to do this.

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The first one is you want to get
yourself to a place of neutral.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to go in
bashing somebody's brains out.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So get yourself to neutral,
however you need to do that.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:53.036 align:middle line:84%
And then ask your partner,
you know, I have a problem.

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:54.910 align:middle line:84%
There's something that's
really bothering me.

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I need your help with it.

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:59.680 align:middle line:84%
When could I have 10
minutes of your time?

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So you're not saying
we need to talk.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because that's--
everyone's frightened when

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:04.785 align:middle line:90%
those words come out.

00:48:04.785 --> 00:48:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: That's like the doctor
saying to you you have cancer.

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: So you never go
in there, we have to talk.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.220 align:middle line:84%
That is not going to-- you're
not going to win there.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So you just gently, kindly
say I have a problem.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:90%
I need your help with it.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.406 align:middle line:90%
When can I have 10 minutes?

00:48:18.406 --> 00:48:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Then when you get
the 10 minutes,

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.320 align:middle line:84%
you need to know the first
three minutes are critical.

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.840 align:middle line:84%
That will set the tone
for the rest of the time.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So you want to start by
saying I just really want

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.160 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge how hard
you've been working

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.800 align:middle line:90%
to take care of the family.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was just over
the moon yesterday

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.640 align:middle line:84%
when you were helping little
Johnny with this homework.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And thanks so much for
taking my mom to the doctor.

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:44.910 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea how
much that means to me

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and I probably don't
tell you often enough

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.910 align:middle line:90%
how much I love you.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: However, there
are a couple things that--

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And here's what
happened last night when we

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.180 align:middle line:84%
were at the party
with Bob and Joan.

00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know you would never, ever
deliberately hurt my feelings

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.160 align:middle line:90%
or humiliate me.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:07.180 align:middle line:84%
But when you said X, Y, and
Z, I really felt A, B, and C.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it
wasn't on purpose.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's an opening for
an apology or a response,

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.585 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to you stupid--

00:49:16.585 --> 00:49:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
not an indictment.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we need
to talk with each other.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody wakes up
in the morning thinking,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.402 align:middle line:84%
wow, how could I
ruin Regina's day.

00:49:28.402 --> 00:49:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: What could I do
today to really piss her off.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.802 align:middle line:84%
And yet we live like people
are hurting us on purpose.

00:49:35.802 --> 00:49:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: And they're not.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:39.430 align:middle line:90%
They're just like us.

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:41.740 align:middle line:84%
They want to be loved
for who they are.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.430 align:middle line:90%
They want to be accepted.

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:45.490 align:middle line:90%
They want to be acknowledged.

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet we are like these
heat seeking missiles--

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.965 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We create
enemy camps almost.

00:49:49.965 --> 00:49:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Right.

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:53.990 align:middle line:90%
You did this is me.

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they did, but
they didn't mean to do it,

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.220 align:middle line:90%
unless they're a psychopath.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.030 align:middle line:84%
In which case, you
know, call a lawyer.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.363 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We need to get going.

00:50:01.363 --> 00:50:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And another thing is,
in partnership, people

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:08.090 align:middle line:84%
tend to give what it is--
and I've seen this a lot--

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:10.910 align:middle line:84%
they tend to give what it
is they want or needed,

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:14.840 align:middle line:84%
instead of giving what the
other person wants or needs.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And it takes time
to decipher this

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.030 align:middle line:90%
and have that conversation.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Yeah, and it can
be an easy conversation.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's say your
birthday is coming up.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like I know you haven't
forgotten that my birthday is

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.840 align:middle line:84%
coming up and you probably
have ideas of what you want

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.410 align:middle line:84%
to get me, but just in case
you don't have any ideas,

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I actually was at the mall the
other day at X, Y, Z store.

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's this white
dress in a size 10

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.340 align:middle line:84%
called the Tahari
something something.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So just in case, you could
drop-- you can plants seeds.

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:51.090 align:middle line:84%
But you do it with a sense of
humor and light-heartedness.

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But when
it goes the other way,

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:57.220 align:middle line:84%
such as I remember one
situation, for a birthday,

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:01.360 align:middle line:84%
where my partner was really big
into playing rugby and gave me

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.930 align:middle line:84%
a rugby t-shirt
from a tournament,

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:05.490 align:middle line:90%
as a birthday present.

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I
don't wear t-shirts.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm not into rugby.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.990 align:middle line:84%
I thanked him for it,
but I thought we're not

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:13.950 align:middle line:90%
on the same page here at all.

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:15.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean why would he
think that I would

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.070 align:middle line:90%
want to wear a rugby t-shirt.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Well, maybe because his
fantasy that he didn't express

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:23.610 align:middle line:84%
was that you'd wear
it with nothing else.

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Maybe there wasn't
any other requests along with

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:29.120 align:middle line:90%
it, so to speak.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.760 align:middle line:84%
But, nonetheless, I
thought, huh, that's odd.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: And you could also--

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I thanked
him, but I thought--

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.739 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Put the t-shirt on
with some high heels and nothing

00:51:35.739 --> 00:51:38.930 align:middle line:84%
else and say you know what this
rugby t-shirt would look really

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:40.740 align:middle line:90%
good with?

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.742 align:middle line:84%
A diamond tennis
bracelet from Tiffany's.

00:51:42.742 --> 00:51:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: See, there you go.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:45.720 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't present
enough to do that.

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I just said, oh, well,
thank you, Eddie.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.641 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:48.641 --> 00:51:50.556 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Yeah, he just
didn't know any better.

00:51:50.556 --> 00:51:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you had "The
Everything Book,"

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.360 align:middle line:90%
he would have known better.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: He would have known
what sizes to get and where

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:57.360 align:middle line:90%
to shop.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, or just the
kindnesses that you appreciate

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.640 align:middle line:90%
in life in general.

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing,
I mean, we're

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.860 align:middle line:84%
as lost on the other side
of knowing how to fulfill

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.110 align:middle line:90%
someone else's desire.

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So I love the idea
of the user's manual,

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.510 align:middle line:84%
the-- what do you call it? "The
Everything Book," that's great.

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:18.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, another
thing is listening.

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:20.680 align:middle line:84%
As you say, this is so critical
because we may be listening,

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.820 align:middle line:84%
but we're not actually
hearing what they're saying.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And so this listening technique
is listen, mirror, summarize,

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:27.217 align:middle line:90%
validate.

00:52:27.217 --> 00:52:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So share that one.

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: It's actually
called the Imago Dialogue,

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.840 align:middle line:90%
which Harville Hendrix created.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's on page 255 in the book.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I actually give
you scripts on how

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:39.032 align:middle line:90%
to have these conversations.

00:52:39.032 --> 00:52:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.967 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: But so if you and I--
let's-- give me a complaint.

00:52:43.967 --> 00:52:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Pretend we're married and you're
going to give me a complaint.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You leave the
toilet seat up all the time.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: OK, so what I heard you
say is that you're unhappy that

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I always leave the
toilet seat up.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Is there
any-- is there more?

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it's just that
I'm the one that has to end up

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.125 align:middle line:90%
cleaning up the toilet seat.

00:53:03.125 --> 00:53:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And so it's icky and I don't--
I don't enjoy doing that.

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: OK, so--
so I understand.

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I leave the toilet seat up and
that just creates more work

00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:13.840 align:middle line:90%
for you, right?

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Did I get that right?

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: OK.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And is there
anything else that--

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's pretty
much-- that's pretty much it.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: OK, so I understand and
I am going to make a commitment

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.640 align:middle line:84%
to really try and do a
better job of not doing that.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, with the toilet
seat up, there's

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:30.110 align:middle line:84%
even a better way to
go forward with that,

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:34.456 align:middle line:84%
is just to say not only
was the toilet seat up,

00:53:34.456 --> 00:53:36.080 align:middle line:84%
but I got up in the
middle of the night

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.450 align:middle line:90%
to go to the bathroom.

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I just thought
I should have added that.

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: And it was dark and my
butt landed in the cold water

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:46.160 align:middle line:90%
and it was really gross.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know you didn't mean to
do it, but it was really awful.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That is
the other part of it.

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:51.950 align:middle line:84%
It occurred to me
after we wrapped it.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:53.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Yes, so the Imago
Dialogue's on page 255.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:00.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a really good thing to
have because communication's

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.450 align:middle line:90%
different for everybody.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:05.725 align:middle line:84%
So we need-- I need to know that
I-- that I heard what you said

00:54:05.725 --> 00:54:07.952 align:middle line:84%
and that you knowledge
that I got it.

00:54:07.952 --> 00:54:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: So we can
move to the next step.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:16.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, you say part
of this whole journey

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:19.340 align:middle line:84%
is once those
chemicals have worn off

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the
reality soup of it all

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and you're making your choice
and decisions day by day,

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and you're really
attempting to listen,

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:31.840 align:middle line:84%
to be as good a potential
mirror as you can

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:35.530 align:middle line:84%
for the other person, and so
forth, the chemicals still

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:36.530 align:middle line:90%
may be gone.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, a lot of times, other
aspects of the relationship,

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:44.140 align:middle line:84%
the juicier parts, and maybe the
sexuality, starts dying back.

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, you're
talking about the importance

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:50.494 align:middle line:84%
of recreating
oxytocin production.

00:54:50.494 --> 00:54:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: So the
first piece of this,

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.090 align:middle line:84%
this is particularly
important for women,

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:57.490 align:middle line:90%
is that we do too much.

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're working, and
we're raising kids,

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and we're taking care
of aging parents,

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:04.009 align:middle line:84%
and there's financial stresses,
and we're giving, giving,

00:55:04.009 --> 00:55:06.180 align:middle line:84%
giving, and we're
stressed to the max.

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we get bitchy because
we're stressed to the max

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and we have nothing
else to give.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So the place that
we need to start

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:17.220 align:middle line:84%
is to become what I
call a pleasure pig.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to put
yourself first and you

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:22.430 align:middle line:84%
need to rebuild your
oxytocin levels.

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin is called the
super glue of love.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's fast, easy,
cheap ways to do this.

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So the fastest way is to go get
a 20 second hug from somebody.

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:36.470 align:middle line:90%
That rebuilds oxytocin.

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:38.240 align:middle line:84%
You can get a
manicure, a pedicure.

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Get your hair done, get a
massage, get a foot rub.

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Go have drinks with
your girlfriends.

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Tell somebody you love them.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Pet your dog, pet your cat.

00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:49.640 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
rebuild oxytocin.

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.029 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But take
responsibility for it yourself.

00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Every day.

00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.528 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:55:53.528 --> 00:55:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: When you make your to
do list, put, number one item,

00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.970 align:middle line:90%
pleasure today.

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So, sometimes,
like twice a week,

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.680 align:middle line:90%
I go get a 30 minute foot rub.

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And I have this woman who
charges me a dollar a minute.

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.160 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.990 align:middle line:84%
On days when I'm too busy or I
don't want to spend any money,

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I go to my playlist
and I listen to Andrea

00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Bocelli sing "The Prayer"
for four and a half minutes.

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Fills me up with oxytocin.

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, for men, who also get
stressed out, what they need

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:24.590 align:middle line:90%
to do is rebuild testosterone.

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.715 align:middle line:84%
So they can do that by
hanging out with the guys--

00:56:26.715 --> 00:56:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Watching
a game on TV.

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Watching sports.

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:30.111 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:56:30.111 --> 00:56:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: It's the
fastest way for most men.

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Chopping wood, playing
sports, all of those things

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.820 align:middle line:90%
rebuild testosterone.

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So in order for
us to keep giving,

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:43.530 align:middle line:84%
we have to fill
ourselves back up.

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you're committed to
rebuilding your relationship,

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.610 align:middle line:84%
first you have to fill up
your own love reservoir.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:52.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's self-love.

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
see this as selfish,

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:59.800 align:middle line:90%
but the truth is it's selfless.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:04.380 align:middle line:84%
You will have more to give when
you fill yourself up first.

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So-- and then, finally,
one other thing, because we

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:10.450 align:middle line:90%
are about out of time.

00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:13.050 align:middle line:90%
And that is vulnerability.

00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:16.050 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing of
vulnerability and fear,

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:18.360 align:middle line:84%
we're afraid of
being vulnerable.

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And just give us a
quick peek at what

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:24.197 align:middle line:84%
that means to allow ourselves to
be vulnerable with one another.

00:57:24.197 --> 00:57:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yeah.

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.360 align:middle line:90%
So you and I are together.

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.660 align:middle line:90%
We've just had this fight.

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:31.140 align:middle line:84%
You've said some really
un-nice things to me.

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And I could scream and yell
back or I could say, wow,

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:38.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling so hurt right now.

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:43.680 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe that I am
on the verge of hysteria.

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.680 align:middle line:10%
And I know you didn't mean
to hurt me this deeply,

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:50.930 align:middle line:10%
but I need to take a few minutes
and pull myself together.

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:53.992 align:middle line:10%
And let's talk in a half hour.

00:57:53.992 --> 00:57:55.700 align:middle line:10%
That's being really
vulnerable and that's

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:58.570 align:middle line:10%
taking responsibility
for your own feelings.

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:00.240 align:middle line:10%
And it's hard to do.

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.052 align:middle line:10%
It's much easier to lash out.

00:58:02.052 --> 00:58:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: But you have to say
what's true for you from an "I"

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.411 align:middle line:84%
place and how it is for you,
as opposed to accusing them.

00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let
yourself be seen.

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: Yes.

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're so often
trying to position ourselves

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and hide who we are from one
another in life in general

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:20.570 align:middle line:84%
by putting the
best face forward.

00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:23.403 align:middle line:84%
So there's no room for that
in an intimate relationship.

00:58:23.403 --> 00:58:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>> FORD: No.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Final words?

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Quickly.

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>> FORD: Yeah, the thing I would
say that I know for sure is

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that if you're with somebody
that you once believed was

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:36.570 align:middle line:84%
your soulmate, I would encourage
you to give it six months

00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:40.300 align:middle line:84%
of taking baby steps and just
doing a few things that are

in ""Turn Your Mate

you're with.
