00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: I'm here
at the annual International UFO

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Congress in Scottsdale, Arizona
where we had a chance to catch

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.000 align:middle line:84%
up with some of the top people
in the world of ufology.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:84%
One such person was
Glenn Steckling,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:84%
who is the gatekeeper for
an amazing body of work

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.141 align:middle line:84%
on the life and times
of George Adamski.

00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Adamski was an elegant
but controversial figure

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:84%
who had access to popes,
presidents, and the Pentagon

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:90%
alike.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Glenn, first of all,
give us the background

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:84%
of George Adamski,
because he's not

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
a well-known name in America
when it comes to ufology.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:84%
We know more modern names
in particular and people

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:90%
in the military.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But in the rest of the world,
Adamski is extremely well-known

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and was a very highly positioned
person even in his day.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.040 align:middle line:90%
So who is this man?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>> GLENN STECKLING:
In present time,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:84%
the story of George
Adamski and his materials,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:84%
his motion picture footage,
his telescopic pictures,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.290 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be put
on the side shelf,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:90%
ignored to a certain extent.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And this has to do with
the many different tangents

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:84%
this subject has taken
over the many decades.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And so when it comes to
George Adamski's reputation

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and notoriety, I would say, as
he was claimed to be the first

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:84%
ambassador to space, the
pioneer in this field,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:84%
he was one of the foremost
individuals who came forward

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:84%
with actual tangible proof that
to this day cannot be denied

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.970 align:middle line:90%
or ridiculed.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:84%
They'll try, but there's no
scientific proof behind it

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
that his pictures and
films are not real.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And so in the '50s and '60s
while George was still alive,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:90%
he lectured worldwide.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:90%
He brought his material out.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes he gave access and
copyright printing authority

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:84%
to foreign countries
without royalties.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
He basically tried to
promote the information

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:90%
as much as possible.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.260 align:middle line:84%
This brought him
before presidents.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
This brought him before major
theological institutions

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:90%
and leaders.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
This brought him
before military.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we met
him in Washington, DC

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:84%
after we had a sighting
downtown in 1963 of one

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:84%
of these craft hovering over
the city in downtown Washington.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And they were ourselves and
about 30 other witnesses

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and a reporter from the
"Washington Daily News."

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.114 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
article in the notebook,

00:02:59.114 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
the original article
which of this is reported.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And my father, who had already
tracked these type of devices

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
for decades, went to
the Library of Congress

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and said I'm going to start
alphabetically, A for Adamski,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:84%
first book, "Flying
Saucers Have Landed,"

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:90%
the exact same photographs.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.324 align:middle line:90%
We wrote to George.

00:03:16.324 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
George said, I'm
coming out three months

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:84%
to lecture to the
Air Force reserves.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And so when he came
out there was always

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:90%
official representation.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to know what
he knew, where he went,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
who he corresponded with,
who he interacted with,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
because he crossed the lines
in this so-called subject that

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
are so difficult
of authenticity.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And so George, as we say, was
well-known in those times,

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.542 align:middle line:84%
and he's also well-known
in these times.

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is that there's

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.755 align:middle line:84%
more of a concentrated effort to
try to pay no attention to him.

00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Almost
to obscure him.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to talk
a little bit about George

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
himself, what this man was
like, how he and your father

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
came into such a
close relationship.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
since the first time

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I saw his face in
a photograph there

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.900 align:middle line:84%
was something to me that was
so kind of elevated and loving,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:84%
compassionate, warm that I
got out of that photograph.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, he would
be the kind of person that

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:90%
would have this kind of contact.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a higher
nature to his being

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:84%
that I experience
looking at him.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
What's the experience
you and your father

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.842 align:middle line:84%
had and, again, how
they came in contact?

00:04:31.842 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Many times the
question is asked, why George?

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Why not so-and-so person
with so-and-so name or doctor

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.220 align:middle line:90%
so-and-so with so-and-so name?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And in reality, those
people also had contact too.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
When George went
on the ships, he

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:84%
noted that there were often
well-known figures also

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
invited upon as well, and
he was not the only one.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But in explanation
to that, George

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
himself was a character very
much as the space visitors

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:90%
themselves were.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:84%
He was highly sympathetic
and passionate

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%
about the human condition,
our levels of understanding,

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
our many frailties, the way our
mind works and doesn't work.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, basically,
he was a very keen observer

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:90%
of human nature.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
he also practiced already

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
long before in the
1930s when he had

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
a school in Laguna
Beach dedicated

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to philosophical thought
of the human endeavor

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and in relationship to
life in outer space.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So it was by no means an
unusual concept for him,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.140 align:middle line:84%
already long before
the pictures came out

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and the great increase
in interest after '47.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And so George as a person, he
had a great sense of humor.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, while
he would recognize the fact

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that we have doubts and we have
this inner struggle within us,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
he also was a disciplinarian,
very much so to the fact

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that he recognized in
order to stay focused,

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
in order to learn the lessons
that we need to learn,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:84%
we need to have some
guidance and some help.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And we need to be
reminded, very much like we

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
do with our own
children, that you

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
have to stay along the
path of understanding

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and not waste too much time and
effort and energy constantly

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.317 align:middle line:84%
running to all these
different tangents.

00:06:36.317 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To the
phenomena of it all.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well, the
phenomena of it all and also

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:90%
to the understanding of life.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:84%
In later years, George was
not so much as concentrated

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.234 align:middle line:84%
as letting people know
that the crafts exist.

00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Because let's face it.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.690 align:middle line:84%
In reality we have
collected enough evidence,

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:90%
photographic, motion picture.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:84%
He had a piece of the
flange of the saucer

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that he gave to
Wilbert Smith, who

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.290 align:middle line:84%
was the scientist of
Project Magnet up in Canada.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
There was so much
activity and concentration

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
where it needed to be that
there was no longer the argument

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.420 align:middle line:84%
necessary and the debate
of intelligent life

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.360 align:middle line:90%
beyond this planet.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:90%
That was a reality.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Now how are we going
to translate that

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
into a better way of
life for ourselves?

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
That was his emphasis
later on in life.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have this
little booklet that's called

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:84%
"Questions and Answers" with him
from what he was shown and what

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:84%
had been explained to him
from these other off-planet

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:90%
cultures.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And what I notice is
when he answers them

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
every answer is imbued with
this compassion and grace.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: He believed
that simplicity was the key

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:90%
to things.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.670 align:middle line:84%
One of the space
contacts once told

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.150 align:middle line:84%
him to understand the
propulsion system,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
a 10-year-old could
understand it.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And a 10-year-old,
because they are not

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:84%
so cluttered in the mind and
not so rigid and predetermined

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
with so-called
theories and parameters

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that really don't exist
in the natural world.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I had an interesting
conversation

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:90%
with two doctor friends of mine.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I did a symposium about six
months ago in the southwest.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And we deal with many different
things, alternative energy,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.144 align:middle line:90%
the realization of this.

00:08:18.144 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
One of them had
his own sightings,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.994 align:middle line:84%
But as you have a conversation
with different people

00:08:24.994 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and different groups of
people from different levels

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
of understanding, you find
out that we are so often

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:84%
restricted by our
preconceptions.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And in
fact, I noticed recently

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.760 align:middle line:84%
in a scientific book where
they talk about theory,

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:84%
the definition was theory will
be accepted as fact until upon

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:84%
which time we
decide to alter it.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, theory by definition
is still theory.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Theory.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Opinion
and supposition.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.899 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: It's based upon
small amounts of information

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
that based on science we should
be able to alter our thinking

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and understanding as
we envelop more of it.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And so George talked
simply to the people.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I listened to the tape
of him in New Zealand

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:90%
when I was driving out.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.711 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions
they asked him was

00:09:12.711 --> 00:09:14.210 align:middle line:84%
have you been in
one of these crafts

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.751 align:middle line:84%
since the last time
we talked to you?

00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes, three times.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And then there was dead
silence in the room,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
because everybody
expected him to elaborate,

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:84%
to give more information,
and George didn't do that.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:90%
He went on to the next question.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:90%
George had an old saying.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.690 align:middle line:84%
He says, I always
told you the truth.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't necessarily
give you all of it.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.393 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:09:36.393 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Now that said--
now you've piqued

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
everyone's curiosity--
did he ever

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.141 align:middle line:84%
talk about his
experience on board?

00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Yes.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.139 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And can you tell
us what the nature of that

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:48.175 align:middle line:84%
experience was like
from what he relayed?

00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well,
in his second book,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
"Inside the Spaceships," he
deals specifically with his

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:84%
continuation of the contact that
he had in the desert in 1952

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that these crafts
had come more to visit him both

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
at his property in Mount Palomar
and that later on he would be

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.891 align:middle line:84%
told to go to a
particular location.

00:10:11.891 --> 00:10:14.515 align:middle line:84%
They would pick him up and then
take him out to a landing spot.

00:10:14.515 --> 00:10:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where was
that in the desert?

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Desert Center is
halfway between here, Phoenix,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.160 align:middle line:90%
and California on Highway 10.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it's
a secluded area.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:84%
You go about 10 miles--
you go along 10 to Blythe,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
to Desert Center

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and you turn off on 177
that goes to Parker.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And as you go
towards Parker north,

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.032 align:middle line:84%
about 10 miles out
of Desert Center

00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:84%
is an area of mountains
called the Coxcomb Mountains.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.615 align:middle line:84%
At the base of
that, that's where

00:10:40.615 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
that particular landing
and occasion happened.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:84%
But the interest
part of it was if you

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:84%
look in "Project Blue
Book," which is available,

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.280 align:middle line:84%
the report on our website,
we had military maneuvers

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:84%
going out of the Salton
Sea at the same day

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:90%
at the same time, 12 o'clock.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the military
pilots reported

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
the unidentified object
at the same time.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have
collaboratable evidence.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about his experience on board.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well,
George interacted--

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
to make this subject very clear,
because there's been a whole

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:84%
lot of misinformation
been promoted--

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:84%
George interacted with men
and women of various sizes

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and races and complexions, not
any different than we have here

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.174 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:11:19.174 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, that's
my understanding.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.006 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Some of the
misnomers that were talked

00:11:23.006 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:84%
about, that he dealt with
Nordics and that whole tangent

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that went out, is
absolutely nonsense.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who does five
minutes of research

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:90%
knows that that's not true.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:84%
George interacted
with men and women

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:84%
who have evolved as we would
normally evolve if we would not

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
constantly rehash
cycles that we manage

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:90%
to become so enveloped with.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We go through series of
birth, building, destruction,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:90%
remake the whole thing.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
We never truly make progressive
progress beyond that.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
We like to think of
these cycles as natural.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Thereby they're more acceptable.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, we
may go 300, 400 years

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and start the process
all over again.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
They have learned that
they can go beyond that

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.120 align:middle line:90%
non-destructively--

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are you saying
we're slow learners?

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Yeah,
we are slow learners.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.403 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:21.056 align:middle line:90%
So these are people, beings.

00:12:21.056 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Human beings.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are they saying
they're humans from the Earth

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:90%
or humans from--

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: No.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.728 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --elsewhere?

00:12:26.728 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: They
are human beings,

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.405 align:middle line:84%
which the human genome is
spread throughout the cosmos.

00:12:33.405 --> 00:12:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: If we understand
anything about astrobiology

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and chemistry, we understand
that all the essential

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:84%
elements, minerals, molecules,
amino acids, are all in space.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the research
like Dr. Panapura and then

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
the latest one I read called
"The Stardust Revolution,"

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:84%
we have become more
and more to the idea

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that life has come from space
and not this primordial ooze

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:84%
over certain billions
of years on the planet.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
You may have sections
that develop as well,

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:84%
but the evolutionary
processes is

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:84%
combined, both
external and internal.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And so once we realize
that, we understand

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:84%
that life is a
universal manifestation

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and that we are not as special
as we'd like to think we are.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And this is a
very difficult concept for most,

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
because they want to think that
we're preconditioned by science

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:84%
fiction and by certain agendas
that we have to have creature

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:90%
features.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to let our
imaginations run

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
wild so that-- and
the funniest thing

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
is is that we've become so
acceptance of the bizarre

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.020 align:middle line:84%
that when you mention human
beings that look like you

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and I, people say, oh my
god, how is that possible?

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.601 align:middle line:84%
So we have inverted
this whole rationale.

00:13:51.601 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That is true.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is specifically
one of the reasons

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.257 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to speak with you
and a few of the others

00:13:57.257 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:84%
that I've selected
at this conference.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Because the human being
aliens have become completely

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:84%
obscured with the
phenomenal, strange,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.980 align:middle line:84%
weird, also the
greys and the others,

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%
tall greys, short greys,
the praying mantis beings,

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it seems
that in the earlier

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:84%
times of the 20th century in
contact most of the contact

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.955 align:middle line:84%
was with what appear
to be human beings.

00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: As far as
several thousand years ago,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:84%
if we look at
historical records.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:29.795 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:29.795 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Exactly so.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
they shared with him

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and what that
experience was like.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: I think to a
certain degree there's some

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.390 align:middle line:90%
confusion.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Because we have
interacted with androids,

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and we have interacted
with robotics.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:90%
These craft carry them as well.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:84%
They do what we consider
would be the dangerous work

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
in between the halls of the
ship, where you have radiation

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and detrimental things
to the human body.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Things that
are upsetting to biology.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.665 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: That's right.

00:14:57.665 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And also it frees
the human being

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
in order to pursue their talents
and their particular purposes

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:84%
in life, so you're
not restricted

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:84%
by such large portions of our
existence, as we are here,

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
dominated by the
need to work and have

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:90%
a living and things like that.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have encountered
robotics and androids.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.135 align:middle line:84%
We have encountered
humanoids and humans.

00:15:21.135 --> 00:15:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the difference
between the two.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: To my knowledge,
those are the only four groups

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:90%
that we have interacted with.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I have yet to see any tangible
evidence of anything else.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we have gone
before the officials who

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:41.050 align:middle line:84%
deal with this matter,
they acknowledged the same.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have some discrepancies
in what's being said.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
But getting back to
your original idea,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.554 align:middle line:90%
what kind of people they are.

00:15:49.554 --> 00:15:57.630 align:middle line:84%
They are the most understanding,
compassionate people,

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.750 align:middle line:84%
because they live
the ever-present now.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:84%
We are so worried
about the past,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:84%
the future, other
dimensions that we

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
spend no time in
the reality of now.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they live, the
ever-constant reality of now.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.190 align:middle line:84%
For them truth is
not an opinion.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not a supposition.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not a theory.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Truth is the revelation
of what something is.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't know, they
have the means to go find out.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So while we would
sit here and try

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:84%
to theorize about
what something is

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and then make up all these other
ideas and spread it all out

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and waste so much
time and energy,

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:84%
they simply go and
realize the truth of it.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
There has been some conjecture
that because these crafts

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
appear and disappear they are
merging into another dimension.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And this question
was asked of them.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no,
absolutely not.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all, your eye is
only capable of tracking

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:90%
so many frames per second.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:90%
I think it's 4,000.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:84%
And there's a speed
associated with that.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Anything that moves faster
than that the human eye

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:90%
will not see.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So basically, since they
are capable of accelerating

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
to the speed of light
and even beyond,

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:84%
you will suddenly
see something there

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:84%
and disappear because due
to its acceleration factor.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.294 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:17:29.294 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: That
is the truth of that.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
makes total sense,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:84%
because it's a matter
of time verses density.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: So the truth
of that is the reality,

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:90%
and that's what they deal with.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And the problem we have
gotten ourselves with

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:84%
is is too much speculation
about what we don't know.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
George used to
have an old saying.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.330 align:middle line:84%
He says, ask me a question,
and if I know the answer,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll share it with you.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.645 align:middle line:84%
If I don't, I'll tell you
honestly I don't know.

00:17:56.645 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But how many people these days
decide that that's a weakness?

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.281 align:middle line:84%
And since that does not
support the concept of ego--

00:18:04.281 --> 00:18:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's not political.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:06.337 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:06.337 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: --they make it up.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.461 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And
that's our problem.

00:18:09.461 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that is our problem.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Now considering the fact
that he is a reporter of fact

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:84%
as he sees it, let's
go back to the ship

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and what the people were
like, what he was told,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and the purpose of it in terms
of extending that to humanity.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: The
interaction was several fold.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's a support
of what you know is true.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:90%
We all need that support.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Principles of life,
principles of character,

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:84%
principles of living we
have embedded within us.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:84%
That is our genetic
reality and connection

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:84%
to the creative force
that creates us.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
We are, as Jesus said, I am the
father and the father is me.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
We are offsprings
of the intelligence

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:90%
that has created us.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
receive that support

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%
from those who live that life
and you see that recognition,

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
it makes your assuredness so
much more deep, so much more

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:90%
strong, just like anything else.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.440 align:middle line:84%
You go out in life
and experience it.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.380 align:middle line:84%
If I think I can
fly an airplane,

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
then let me go see if
I can fly an airplane.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And if I can fly an airplane,
I have that assuredness

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:84%
of character that says I
was capable of doing it,

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
once again, the truth
of the actual reality

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:90%
of doing and experiencing.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:90%
So they, in part, gave him that.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, they also exposed
him to greater understanding.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Because as we have so we call
wise people in our society

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.880 align:middle line:84%
or those who come amongst
us to teach us periodically,

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:84%
they too have those who
have progressed over time

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and acquired an immense amount
of knowledge and civilization

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.410 align:middle line:84%
in the stepping stone and
the stepping ladder of life.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And so they have also
given that respect

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to those people who
also teach them.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it is a
never-ending ladder.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, it's described as
you can go up the ladder if you

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.760 align:middle line:84%
wish or you can go
down and retrogress

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:90%
if you choose that as well.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the choice
is given to us.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:84%
The exposure is saying--
they come and they say look,

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:90%
here are the ships.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:84%
They operate differently
than the aerodynamics

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:90%
that we're accustomed to.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:84%
If we can do it, then
you also have the ability

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:90%
to understand how to do it too.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And once you mime
and replicate it,

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:43.220 align:middle line:84%
you then start to have access
to greater understanding,

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:84%
because you can start to
leave this small world of ours

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:90%
as grain and molecule of sand.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And so all of that embedded
into George's understanding

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:01.060 align:middle line:84%
of where we are and
where we could be.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And that where we
could be is he was

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:84%
adamant in giving us that
picture of the future.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.680 align:middle line:84%
When we look to the future
today in science fiction

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
or we listen to talks
and we see programming,

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:84%
we paint a dismal future:
destruction, robotics, chaos.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: All toward a
transhumanist type of view

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.197 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:21:27.197 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a fan of it.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: It's
a predetermined--

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: --mantra
that is supposed to engage

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.250 align:middle line:84%
your thinking that says that
the willingness to accept

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Armageddon because that's
the only way you can renew

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:90%
yourself, which is nonsense.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.052 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Nonsense.

00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Nonsense.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, consequently,
George was there,

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and my father carried
that directly from him,

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and I try to do the
same, of giving people

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:55.950 align:middle line:84%
a progressive view of the
future that they have now

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:90%
that is a attainable now.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.555 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
that look like?

00:21:58.555 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:90%
What's it look like?

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.418 align:middle line:90%
What are we capable of?

00:22:00.418 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: We now--
in fact, I will add that

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.570 align:middle line:90%
in my presentation.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a book called
"Colonies in Space."

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
It was produced in 1977,
dedicated to President Kennedy.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you look in there,
you will find drawings

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.625 align:middle line:84%
based upon our
scientific abilities

00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:84%
of to travel in
space at that moment.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
We had the ability
technologically

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
to build crafts that were
very much like Biosphere 2

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
out here in Arizona,
complete environments inside

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:84%
in which we were able to
travel the distances of space

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:84%
or between the planets in a
semi-Earth-like environment,

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.600 align:middle line:84%
not in a little metal tin
can wrapped up and worried

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
about solar winds and radiation
and bombardments of meteorites.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we had that
technology then,

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:90%
and we are being denied it.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Because this will allow us
to make sociological changes

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:57.117 align:middle line:84%
that are not congruent with
the status quo as it is today.

00:22:57.117 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:90%
The politics--

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With the propagation
of that dystopian future

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: I don't look at
it as dystopian so much as what

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.351 align:middle line:90%
you're capable of having.

00:23:07.351 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, I'm saying what
is being propagated via media

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, which is
this very dark outcome.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.335 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: It's a very dark
outcome that we're all too

00:23:14.335 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:90%
willing to easily accept.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And by accepting it, we
are accepting the fact

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that we are running the
world through the economics

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.870 align:middle line:84%
of military industrialization,
of the use of aggression,

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:84%
the use of inflamed hotspots,
this constant political

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:84%
maneuvering of
opinion and agenda

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.832 align:middle line:84%
and the manipulation of
medicine and food and, my god,

00:23:45.832 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:90%
everything that--

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And above all--

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: --comes around it.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --limitation.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And limitation,
so that there are those who have

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.230 align:middle line:90%
and those who won't have.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:90%
So we're all familiar with that.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.690 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is turn
the news on, go to the movies,

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:90%
read the paper.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Those are a reflection
of an agenda

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.090 align:middle line:84%
to move us down
this chute that's

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.055 align:middle line:84%
very destructive to
our psyche and soul.

00:24:08.055 --> 00:24:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And
it's very distinct.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very distinct.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.041 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And
it's very distinct.

00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And to give you an
example, the propagation

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:84%
of this agenda started
in the late '50s,

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:25.005 align:middle line:84%
became testbed in '61, and by
'65 had moved into full force.

00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:90%
So now what did they show him?

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
What is our actual
future going to look

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.199 align:middle line:90%
like if we can embrace it?

00:24:31.199 --> 00:24:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously we
have a choice in this.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
If we choose to put all our
energy behind the darkness,

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:84%
well, we can put ourselves
down that chute if we like.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about what
else is possible and probable

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:84%
if we choose to put
ourselves there.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well, they came
here to also make us aware that

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:84%
with the invention of the atomic
power and atomic bombs that we

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.890 align:middle line:84%
could go instantaneously in
a direction that we could not

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:90%
reverse.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.054 align:middle line:90%
So that was very important.

00:24:59.054 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the articles
that came from microfiche,

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I originally did
some investigations.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:84%
"LA Times," '57,
mysterious objects

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.350 align:middle line:90%
seen over the first a-bomb test.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Bright objects seen
over a testing area.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea was that it
was very prevalent to make sure

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't push the button
through our own stupidity.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.377 align:middle line:84%
And to my knowledge, they
have stepped in three times

00:25:23.377 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:90%
to avert nuclear disaster.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what
I understand, yes.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.306 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And so while I
often hear from people, well,

00:25:28.306 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
how come they don't walk
amongst us-- which they do--

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and how come they don't go
over, fly over major cities?

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I have articles over
every major city.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is one of the
most precious binders that

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.510 align:middle line:84%
exists on the
planet, all of this--

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well, I
wouldn't go that far.

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, it is to me.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.453 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Let's say we
have a lot in civilian hands.

00:25:44.453 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But I can assure you in official
hands it's far, far more.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, this
is interesting,

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.470 align:middle line:84%
because this has to do with
branches of the military,

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
validation, letters to Adamski
and your father directly.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:90%
This is original too.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:90%
This is beautiful.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: I kept it that way
because in this particular day

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:middle line:84%
of so many claims, I find
that people are making a lot

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.790 align:middle line:84%
of claims and not being called
on to be responsible for them.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: These are the
original letters, yes.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: There you go.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.490 align:middle line:90%
There it is for you.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: So quickly,
our future is what we wish it

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:84%
If we see an environment,
like for instance,

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:84%
well, we all want
to go on holiday.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's say we picture Bora Bora.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:84%
We're laying on a beach, a
nice mai tai in the hand.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.330 align:middle line:84%
That can be our future
if we wish it to be.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:37.100 align:middle line:84%
We can make our future
anything we want.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully by
seeing and interacting

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.842 align:middle line:84%
with those who have made their
future something that we can--

00:26:43.842 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: More utopian, yes.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: --look at and
say this is our possibilities,

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.740 align:middle line:90%
then we know we can attain it.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But you'd be surprised how many
people who don't think that

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:84%
the utopia, as we call it--
because that makes it all too

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.680 align:middle line:84%
altruistic-- is not feasible,
that we cannot give up a system

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.850 align:middle line:84%
for something better because
we're too scared to let go

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:84%
of what we know,
even if it's rotten.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I would rather have a
rotten sandwich in my hand

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:84%
to know that I have no sandwich
at all tomorrow or not to have

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:84%
the faith that I am capable
of producing something

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:90%
better tomorrow.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:90%
We have no faith.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.274 align:middle line:84%
It's a word, but we
don't really believe it.

00:27:23.274 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:90%
So they showed him this.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about some specifics.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:84%
When they were talking about
the propulsion systems,

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:35.460 align:middle line:84%
which are said to be very,
very simple, simple aspects

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:84%
of repulsion, attraction,
and so forth--

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Magnetism.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Magnetism.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.180 align:middle line:90%
Just magnetism, so simple.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.506 align:middle line:84%
When did they say that
will be more common pla--

00:27:43.506 --> 00:27:45.130 align:middle line:84%
or did they say when
it's going to be--

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: It
was already then.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.048 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, they had it.

00:27:47.048 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But did they give
you any time frames

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.754 align:middle line:84%
as to when it might be
released for the common good?

00:27:51.754 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: To
my understanding,

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:58.200 align:middle line:84%
we have duplicated
magnetic propulsion,

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.267 align:middle line:84%
or what we would call free
energy devices already

00:28:01.267 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:90%
for the last 40, 50 years.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're there, yeah.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: We have them--

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.446 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: --just like we
have carburetion systems from

00:28:07.446 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:84%
the '30s that are
good for 100 miles.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So we have organizations and we
have forces here on this world

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.980 align:middle line:84%
who, once again, as
we talked before,

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.980 align:middle line:90%
have an established status quo.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we maintain
that status quo

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:84%
because we are totally
enveloped in the consumption

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and utilization of oil.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:32.954 align:middle line:84%
It permeates transportation,
plastics, medicine, everything.

00:28:32.954 --> 00:28:35.492 align:middle line:84%
And you do not switch
that overnight.

00:28:35.492 --> 00:28:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that's
not a fair question.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:90%
We had already done it by then.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.790 align:middle line:84%
It's that if you can't allow it
to come forward because we're

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.930 align:middle line:84%
constricted by whatever these
other military and corporate

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.815 align:middle line:84%
forces are, it's
kind of irrelevant

00:28:47.815 --> 00:28:49.245 align:middle line:90%
until-- how do we overcome that?

00:28:49.245 --> 00:28:50.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to know.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: We are restricted
also, each and every one of us.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.374 align:middle line:84%
We have to take
personal responsibility.

00:28:55.374 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: True.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: We
all have 401(k)s.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:84%
We have retirement that
we're looking forward to.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.440 align:middle line:90%
We have investments.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to say, OK, what
kind of a principled person

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:90%
am I?

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to put my
money in something

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.290 align:middle line:84%
that has a high return that may
be the production of weapons

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:90%
or the distribution of this?

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Or am I going to put it in
solar power or wind power?

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Or am I going to
invest it in people,

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.230 align:middle line:84%
which there's a
much smaller return?

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So the problem is is while
we hold everybody else

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to high standards
in our minds, we

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:32.670 align:middle line:84%
don't hold ourselves to
the same high standards.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.844 align:middle line:84%
Because the changes
begin with us.

00:29:34.844 --> 00:29:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.050 align:middle line:90%
No, I agree with that.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And the average person
now doesn't have an IRA.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.090 align:middle line:84%
The average person would love
to see this kind of future

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:84%
become our reality but feel
powerless in the face of-- you

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.250 align:middle line:90%
know what I'm saying.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well,
it's purposely done.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.483 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:29:50.483 --> 00:29:55.609 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Division has
been our greatest enemy.

00:29:55.609 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:84%
The other day I was
asked a question.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And it says, well, how do
you feel about the one world

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:00.650 align:middle line:90%
government?

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:04.065 align:middle line:84%
Because we are used to using
this term in a negative aspect,

00:30:04.065 --> 00:30:06.565 align:middle line:84%
whether the Bushes were involved
with it or the Rockefellers

00:30:06.565 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:84%
We believe that this
is going to take away

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.840 align:middle line:90%
from our individualism.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:84%
But yet, if we look at
the reverse of that,

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:84%
so much destructive time
is wasted in nationalism.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And whose face is
printed on the bill

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.160 align:middle line:84%
of the denomination
of the dollar?

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I don't care if
it's Washington, the Queen,

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:84%
or a hemp plant as
long as it works

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.820 align:middle line:90%
for what it needs to work for.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:37.810 align:middle line:84%
We place so much emphasis
on that which has no value.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And in reality, if we worked
towards a cohesive unit

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:84%
of government and
administration to the people,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:53.710 align:middle line:84%
a one-world government is
our natural progression.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well now, about three
years ago I was interviewing

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:90%
a woman named Sheila Gillette.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And she is a person who's done
channeling for the last 40

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.410 align:middle line:90%
years and has a good reputation.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to the
THEO group about this.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, tell us
what our future is

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:13.020 align:middle line:84%
going to look like in terms of
the structure of it and also

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.160 align:middle line:90%
economically.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what they said.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.820 align:middle line:84%
They said, you are
moving toward what

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:84%
people call a
one-world government

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and a one-world
currency ultimately.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.680 align:middle line:84%
But-- and they were
very clear to underline

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.270 align:middle line:84%
this-- do understand,
by the time

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.260 align:middle line:84%
this occurs, the
consciousness on the planet

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.900 align:middle line:84%
will have elevated
itself to the point

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.110 align:middle line:84%
where this is a
desirable things,

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and you'll become
a planetary culture

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:41.770 align:middle line:84%
with regional proclivities,
differences, foods.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:42.520 align:middle line:90%
All that exists.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Individuality still exists.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Greater
individuality.

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Greater
individuality,

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:84%
but not this fighting and
jostling for resources

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.330 align:middle line:90%
and power.

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:53.630 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that's true.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.745 align:middle line:84%
The term one-world government
has taking on an exclusively

00:31:56.745 --> 00:31:57.245 align:middle line:90%
negative--

00:31:57.245 --> 00:31:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: That's true.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --meaning.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Because we use
that to project that each

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and every person will not have
the freedoms they think they

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.050 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.052 align:middle line:84%
In reality, you have very
few freedoms as it is.

00:32:07.052 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And when
you think about it,

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.390 align:middle line:84%
you really don't have freedom
from economic prejudice.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:17.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't have freedom from the
demands that are made upon you.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.150 align:middle line:84%
In reality, your life
is highly regulated.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you think
the only freedom

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.682 align:middle line:84%
you do have is the freedom of
consumerism, which drives--

00:32:25.682 --> 00:32:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well--

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: --the
world economy.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --there
is one other freedom.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.849 align:middle line:84%
And I remember years
ago I interviewed

00:32:29.849 --> 00:32:31.390 align:middle line:84%
a man named Rob
Williams, and he said

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.010 align:middle line:84%
what we're coming down to
is there really is only one

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.810 align:middle line:84%
freedom left, and that's
the freedom of the ability

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to conceive and create,
the freedom of the mind.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the last frontier.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.103 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: That's true.

00:32:41.103 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I'd like to find
out what did they share with

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Adamski about our ability to
create on the mental frontier?

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: They have taught
us that we are struggling with

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.170 align:middle line:90%
ourselves in a twofold way.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:04.210 align:middle line:84%
We here on this world have
learned the exultation

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:84%
of the mind, the
power of the mind.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:13.125 align:middle line:84%
And for the short-term, the
mind can get you results.

00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:15.345 align:middle line:84%
The trouble is
they're not lasting.

00:33:15.345 --> 00:33:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I liken this to an example of
putting a coin in your hand

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and squeezing it as hard as
you can for as long as you can.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you cannot
exert that pressure forever,

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and you're going have
to relax your grip.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And so you're wasting
so much energy

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.000 align:middle line:84%
to hold onto something
that you can already

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.070 align:middle line:84%
have the power of
through consciousness

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:84%
or your other part of your
intellectual and intelligence.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And so while the power of
the mind will bend a fork,

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:49.590 align:middle line:84%
the power of consciousness will
levitate it across the room.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So you have the two
halves of ourselves.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And that's where
you have the trinity, body,

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.990 align:middle line:84%
mind, and consciousness,
the father, the mother,

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.370 align:middle line:90%
and the eternal spirit.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And so this struggle
for self and ego verses

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:12.659 align:middle line:84%
universality happens with each
one of us every single day.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:16.739 align:middle line:84%
They have learned to
discipline themselves

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:22.159 align:middle line:84%
to realize that by giving
in, as we would call it,

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:27.250 align:middle line:84%
or being the peacemaker
or being flexible,

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:30.250 align:middle line:84%
you can attain far more things
than constantly demanding

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.010 align:middle line:84%
your own way, demanding
your own opinion,

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
demanding your
own justification.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And so this struggle between
mind and consciousness

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.989 align:middle line:84%
is the duality that
they come to show us.

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And they come to show us that if
you live in a mind environment,

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.550 align:middle line:90%
you have a me society.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.429 align:middle line:84%
And I think you can
safely say that's what

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:51.540 align:middle line:90%
we're living here today--

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Rather than in--

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:52.239 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: --a me society--

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --in the
broader consciousness, yes.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.185 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: --which is a
broader consciousness of an us

00:34:56.185 --> 00:35:00.066 align:middle line:84%
society, which doesn't mean that
you are any less the individual

00:35:00.066 --> 00:35:00.565 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:02.790 align:middle line:90%
You have greater individuality.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is, like a family unit,

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:84%
you're willing to encompass
and make accommodations.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Because you say, well,
this is my son or daughter.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.270 align:middle line:90%
This is my family.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.380 align:middle line:90%
This is my blood.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.710 align:middle line:90%
So I can be a bigger person.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, that stretches
into our community.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.240 align:middle line:90%
That stretches into our nation.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
hopefully it stretches

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.457 align:middle line:90%
into our concept of humanity.

00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And it's interesting.

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.420 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about the need for us

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.170 align:middle line:84%
to be not only
thinking in the larger

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.420 align:middle line:84%
concept of us but
this flexibility.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And that just flashed
back into my mind

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing Dr. Rocco
Errico, an Aramaic scholar.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying that
the passage in the Bible

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:47.040 align:middle line:84%
called "and the meek shall
inherit the Earth," he said,

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.370 align:middle line:90%
do you know what that means?

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.079 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone thinks
it means cowards.

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:50.786 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: No.

00:35:50.786 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He said, that means
the flexible shall inherit

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:56.125 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, those who can bend
with what's needed and adapt.

00:35:56.125 --> 00:35:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: That's
exactly what that means.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.625 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:35:58.625 --> 00:36:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: It means that
by being the representation

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.640 align:middle line:84%
of something greater, this
is what your heritage can be

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and that the rest of us will
tear ourselves to pieces

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:15.120 align:middle line:84%
in the process and that those
who choose to disconnect from

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.830 align:middle line:84%
that will be
inheriting the Earth,

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:84%
because they're the only ones
left, if we allow that to be.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: There's such a
great dichotomy in translation.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading--
and I've already

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.510 align:middle line:84%
known this, having to do
with historical record.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:34.276 align:middle line:84%
And George wrote extensively
about biblical history.

00:36:34.276 --> 00:36:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, I saw that.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: I have-- well,
some of it's in the archives,

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:37.640 align:middle line:90%
no one's seen.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.017 align:middle line:90%
But anyway--

00:36:39.017 --> 00:36:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us the
juiciest stuff, by the way.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Yeah,
everybody wants the scoop.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's go there,
since you brought it up.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask the
scoop on the nature of some

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.680 align:middle line:84%
of the more well-known prophetic
figures throughout history

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.870 align:middle line:84%
and what they may have told him
about these beings, who they

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.590 align:middle line:84%
were, what they came for
at that particular time.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Were they humans that were in
contact with others imbued?

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Or were they actually,
perhaps, some of these beings

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.840 align:middle line:90%
that walk among us?

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a big,
fat, long question.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well, I
think, first of all,

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
universal principle, regardless
of where it comes from,

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:90%
is what is most pertinent.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:33.000 align:middle line:84%
If it comes from a
scholar of this world

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.690 align:middle line:84%
or from those who come to visit
us from others, if it comes

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:44.040 align:middle line:84%
from the so-called sages
and teachers of the past,

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.500 align:middle line:84%
it is what they said
that made the most

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:84%
importance and the
principles they

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.130 align:middle line:90%
lived which were most dire.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:54.500 align:middle line:90%
I had to laugh the other day.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I watched a black comedian
who said, you know,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.455 align:middle line:84%
have you ever noticed that
everybody's arguing about what

00:38:01.455 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:84%
so-and-so said and
so-and-so said.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:07.540 align:middle line:84%
He says, but have
they got the message?

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.876 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's gotten the message.

00:38:08.876 --> 00:38:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Nobody applies the message.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Nope.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And so it has been
said in biblical records to be

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.620 align:middle line:84%
aware that you have
entertained sometimes angels.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Because we have
to put everything

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:23.220 align:middle line:90%
in the context of that time.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Anything that came from
the sky was angelic.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:28.610 align:middle line:84%
You had nothing
else to relate to.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.090 align:middle line:84%
You had nothing else
to compare it to,

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:84%
because we did not live in
a technology at that time

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.185 align:middle line:84%
where you could say,
well, that's an airplane

00:38:35.185 --> 00:38:36.770 align:middle line:84%
or that's a balloon
or that's a blimp.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.352 align:middle line:84%
So that when things
came from the sky,

00:38:39.352 --> 00:38:40.810 align:middle line:84%
they had to compare
it to what they

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.580 align:middle line:84%
had, the wheel with the wheel,
the flying shield, the flying

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.184 align:middle line:90%
scroll, the--

00:38:45.184 --> 00:38:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Chariots of fire.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: --chariot of fire.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Those people who came
amongst us and so-called

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:55.000 align:middle line:84%
were giants in understanding--
and now the other day,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I had to listen to somebody
make this, well, they

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.420 align:middle line:90%
must have been 10 feet tall.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.060 align:middle line:90%
And I felt like saying, idiots.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We have giants of industry,
and they're not 10 feet tall.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So consequently, we
misinterpret everything.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.420 align:middle line:84%
We cut it down,
we it analyze it.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.590 align:middle line:84%
We put it frontward,
backwards, and we come up

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.710 align:middle line:84%
with meanings that
had absolutely nothing

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.660 align:middle line:84%
to do with what
was going on there.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So consequently, when
we look at Buddha

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.995 align:middle line:84%
and you look at Confucius
and you look at Jesus

00:39:22.995 --> 00:39:24.745 align:middle line:84%
and you look, to some
degrees, at Muhammad

00:39:24.745 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and what these
people had to say,

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.230 align:middle line:84%
they all taught some
basic principles.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:40.610 align:middle line:84%
One, that life is precious,
that we should honor our father

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:42.811 align:middle line:84%
and mother, which doesn't
mean our biological father

00:39:42.811 --> 00:39:43.310 align:middle line:90%
and mother.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:46.700 align:middle line:84%
It means our father,
who is our creator,

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and our mother, who is
the natural principles

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and the planet
upon which we live.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.600 align:middle line:90%
They have taught us not to kill.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I've seen so many
arguments about this.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.390 align:middle line:84%
One woman, she
argued about the fact

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:04.667 align:middle line:84%
that, well, he didn't say
thou shall not kill or thou

00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:05.375 align:middle line:90%
shall not murder.

00:40:05.375 --> 00:40:07.625 align:middle line:84%
I said, you have the Old
Testament, commandment number

00:40:07.625 --> 00:40:08.440 align:middle line:90%
six.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Bottom line is is that
it says you're not

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.710 align:middle line:84%
supposed to take
someone else's life.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how you cut
it and try to justify it,

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.270 align:middle line:90%
you can't do that.

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.454 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yet each religion
kills in the name of--

00:40:19.454 --> 00:40:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Oh, yes.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --its own religion.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So I guess the real
question I'm asking here

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.720 align:middle line:84%
is you talked about humans,
beings that are humans that

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.170 align:middle line:84%
walk among us, humanoids
that walk among us,

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:32.020 align:middle line:84%
beings from other places with
other levels of understanding

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:32.905 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge.

00:40:32.905 --> 00:40:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So the characters that we've
just spoken about historically,

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Confucius,
Buddha, Muhammad,

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, are
any of those beings

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.100 align:middle line:84%
said to be some of
these humanoids, humans

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.710 align:middle line:84%
who walk among us
from other places?

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well, some of
them have made that claim

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:48.260 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.305 align:middle line:90%
Jesus made the statement.

00:40:49.305 --> 00:40:52.400 align:middle line:84%
He says, I am in your
world but not of it.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, there you go.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And so of
course religion has its own

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.620 align:middle line:90%
interpretation of that.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But the idea here is
that understanding

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:18.190 align:middle line:84%
is a progressive state of the
development of an individual.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And so Christhood is a
level of understanding,

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.700 align:middle line:90%
a level of an attainment.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.975 align:middle line:84%
And that is a level that
we are all capable of.

00:41:26.975 --> 00:41:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: If you
remember, he made a statement,

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.161 align:middle line:84%
there are those of you who will
do greater things than I have

00:41:32.161 --> 00:41:32.770 align:middle line:90%
done.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we believe the
religious interpretations who

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.000 align:middle line:84%
say he was God, how do you
do greater things than God?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So clearly that's not the true
explanation of that statement.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, it's a
realization that each person

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:50.220 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to
progress and to understand

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:54.010 align:middle line:84%
their own natural
continuation and progress

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:57.640 align:middle line:84%
in the ever-moving
stream of life.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.889 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And so whether
they have come from other

00:42:00.889 --> 00:42:08.410 align:middle line:84%
places or not, this is something
that will be debated for a long

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:09.470 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:11.810 align:middle line:90%
I will say at least this much.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:16.570 align:middle line:84%
This is as much as I'm willing
to say, is that most of them,

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:20.096 align:middle line:84%
at one time or
another, had contact.

00:42:20.096 --> 00:42:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're talking
about Adamski's archives

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:28.370 align:middle line:84%
that we don't all
necessarily have access to.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So I get that there are levels
of information out of there,

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and I appreciate
your sharing that.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well, it's not
because there's any great

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.370 align:middle line:84%
mystery or any great
need to withhold.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:43.240 align:middle line:90%


00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to
understand something.

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:48.400 align:middle line:90%


00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.060 align:middle line:84%
As you go through the level
of accumulating knowledge,

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.920 align:middle line:84%
you cannot have it all
dropped on you at one time.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.660 align:middle line:84%
The mind wants to say give
me everything you've got.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Because we want to accumulate.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.950 align:middle line:84%
We want to have it
in our possession.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.900 align:middle line:90%
We want to do what have you.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, we
have to be walked

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.899 align:middle line:90%
through aspects of understand.

00:43:10.899 --> 00:43:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:14.230 align:middle line:84%
But I think that process
is definitely speeding up.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And with the younger
generation being born,

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.710 align:middle line:84%
it's going to move much
more quickly, for those that

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:24.060 align:middle line:84%
can unplug from the way the
perceived notion of who we are

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and where we're headed via
the media is taking us.

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.570 align:middle line:84%
As long as people
are individualistic

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:31.010 align:middle line:84%
in their thinking,
that's my own opinion.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:33.830 align:middle line:84%
But I want to go into the church
part of it a little bit more.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Because Adamski met with the
pope, and very few people

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:90%
know this.

just for a still shot of it.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:90%

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.720 align:middle line:90%
to the pope's death.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.310 align:middle line:84%
George went to
Rome by invitation.

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.550 align:middle line:90%
He took two witnesses with him.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:39.326 align:middle line:84%
One was by the name of May
Morlet, May Morlet-Flitcroft,

00:44:39.326 --> 00:44:40.450 align:middle line:90%
who now lives in Australia.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:43.330 align:middle line:84%
She's one of the very
few surviving coworkers,

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:46.350 align:middle line:84%
along with my mother,
from the original cadre.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And the other one was a lady
by the name of Louzette Stag.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And so George went to Rome,
and a very young representative

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:56.990 align:middle line:84%
the Church came and took
George to the Vatican

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:01.820 align:middle line:84%
through the side entrance
into the papal residence.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And the message was delivered.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:08.960 align:middle line:84%
George described the pope as
far as his medical condition,

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.070 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Then he was taken
back to his hotel,

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.935 align:middle line:84%
and he was given the
gold medal from the pope

00:45:17.935 --> 00:45:20.185 align:middle line:84%
as an appreciation and
acknowledgement for the service

00:45:20.185 --> 00:45:22.220 align:middle line:90%
that he had conducted.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And so George, he
was not a person

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.310 align:middle line:84%
who ran around and
flaunted things.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:29.120 align:middle line:90%
He didn't need to.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.440 align:middle line:90%
He carried it in his pocket.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Desmond
Leslie, Lord Leslie,

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.040 align:middle line:84%
who was one of his
co-authors would

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:39.210 align:middle line:84%
remark and say, well, George,
what are you doing today?

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:40.900 align:middle line:84%
He says, oh, well,
I'm going fishing,

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and I got the medal in my
pocket in case anybody's

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.220 align:middle line:90%
interested in seeing it.

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:52.040 align:middle line:84%
He was not overly,
shall we say, taken

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.470 align:middle line:90%
with himself because of it.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.881 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And
so the message--

00:45:56.881 --> 00:45:58.380 align:middle line:84%
if the question's
going to be asked,

00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.540 align:middle line:90%
what did the message contain?

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right, yes.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:03.088 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Yes, I'm aware
of what the message contained.

00:46:03.088 --> 00:46:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But I will leave that to
the discretion of the Church

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to decide if and at what time
they are willing to share that

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:10.240 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of the public.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:10.823 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:46:10.823 --> 00:46:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And we know that they're
deep into the study

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.150 align:middle line:84%
of intelligent life
beyond the Earth,

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:90%
outer space and so forth.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.485 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well, it goes
to the very foundations

00:46:21.485 --> 00:46:23.580 align:middle line:90%
of their beginning.

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.609 align:middle line:84%
We mentioned that the
sages of old had--

00:46:26.609 --> 00:46:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:27.675 align:middle line:90%
Contact, yes.

00:46:27.675 --> 00:46:29.341 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: --contact
and interaction.

00:46:29.341 --> 00:46:33.820 align:middle line:84%
In reality, that is
also contributing

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.000 align:middle line:84%
to the foundation of
the Church itself.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:36.876 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:36.876 --> 00:46:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: How it's been
represented or misrepresented

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.114 align:middle line:84%
since that time, well, we're
dealing with the fallibility

00:46:42.114 --> 00:46:42.780 align:middle line:90%
of human beings.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
high level for him

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.090 align:middle line:84%
to connect with in
the world of religion.

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:52.270 align:middle line:84%
But he also had very easy
access to the Pentagon.

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:53.955 align:middle line:90%
He was buried at Arlington.

00:46:53.955 --> 00:46:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well, that's
no significance to that.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.180 align:middle line:90%
That's a misnomer.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Is it?

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.673 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: First of all,
he want to see Queen Juliana

00:46:59.673 --> 00:47:00.560 align:middle line:90%
in the Netherlands.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.912 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:47:01.912 --> 00:47:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And there
were discussions there.

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.940 align:middle line:84%
The press itself was very
angry because he would not

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:11.100 align:middle line:84%
discuss personably exactly
what the queen said.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And so he deferred
and said that it's

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.085 align:middle line:84%
the right of the royal family
to discuss at which time

00:47:15.085 --> 00:47:15.710 align:middle line:90%
they wished to.

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So they became very
critical of him

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:20.430 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't just blab
like everybody else would.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:23.040 align:middle line:84%
He was scheduled to see the
royal family in England.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.640 align:middle line:84%
But due to the negative
press in the Netherlands,

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:29.820 align:middle line:84%
the royal family officially
withdrew but not unofficially.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So when George
was in, English he

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.520 align:middle line:84%
was sponsored by
Lord Dowding, who

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.700 align:middle line:84%
was the Lord Air Marshal
of all the Air Force,

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.920 align:middle line:90%
during his lectures there.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he debated
with Patrick Moore.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And so he had very high level
sponsors and very high level

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.677 align:middle line:90%
access.

00:47:47.677 --> 00:47:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And I know the royal
family in England

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.120 align:middle line:84%
have been interested, because
I, myself, my father's book

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.020 align:middle line:84%
after his lecture in
the House of Lords

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.080 align:middle line:84%
was given to Prince Philip, and
we received the acknowledgement

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:56.735 align:middle line:90%
for that gift.

00:47:56.735 --> 00:47:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And so there's
some talk, as we did with Tim,

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.550 align:middle line:84%
that had to do
with-- Timothy Good--

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:08.110 align:middle line:84%
that when Lord Mountbatten,
his uncle in the Irish estate,

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:09.951 align:middle line:84%
of one of the saucers
touching down.

00:48:09.951 --> 00:48:11.450 align:middle line:84%
That was an actual
event, and that's

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:14.510 align:middle line:84%
been known for probably 30
years at least at this point.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So some things get rehashed
as new, where, in fact, they

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.630 align:middle line:84%
have been circulating
for quite a while.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But going back to
George and the Pentagon,

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.350 align:middle line:84%
there's been some speculation
that because he had access

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:29.202 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, limited access,
that he was working for them.

00:48:29.202 --> 00:48:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And nothing could
be further from--

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, no.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:31.720 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't-- actually--

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: No, no.

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:33.060 align:middle line:90%
But I want to--

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.096 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --I hope you know
that that's not what I was

00:48:34.096 --> 00:48:34.596 align:middle line:90%
suggesting.

00:48:34.596 --> 00:48:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: He was not working
for them in any shape or form.

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And so what he did is he made
his material easily available.

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.250 align:middle line:84%
When he took the
pictures, he invited

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:46.500 align:middle line:84%
them to come up to Mount
Palomar because the Hale

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Observatory was up there.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
back and forth,

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:50.675 align:middle line:84%
and he was friends with
a lot of the astronomers.

00:48:50.675 --> 00:48:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he has an
amazing array of photos.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And he has an
amazing array of photos taken

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.050 align:middle line:90%
with telescopic conditions.

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:57.190 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be faked.

00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: They have been
analyzed and proven that.

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:02.039 align:middle line:84%
And so he gave them freely
to the government and said,

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:06.430 align:middle line:84%
you boys are in charge of
the people on this planet

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:middle line:90%
or in this country.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.350 align:middle line:84%
You need to know
what's going on.

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:11.558 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, right here,
Department of Air Force.

00:49:11.558 --> 00:49:13.456 align:middle line:84%
There's one letter here
from George Freeman,

00:49:13.456 --> 00:49:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Colonel
in the US Air Force.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:15.871 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Yeah.

00:49:15.871 --> 00:49:20.530 align:middle line:84%
If you go in and look at any
UFO history in the late 1950s,

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:22.656 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Freeman was
one of the major--

00:49:22.656 --> 00:49:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he's
saying we, the Air Force,

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.230 align:middle line:84%
are interested in your footage
and exploring this further with

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.480 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.271 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Yeah.

00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:30.240 align:middle line:84%
We went there in '67
and showed the films

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.447 align:middle line:90%
and interacted with them.

00:49:32.447 --> 00:49:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:36.384 align:middle line:84%
So we get that they were
interested, for good reason.

00:49:36.384 --> 00:49:37.800 align:middle line:84%
There was something
about him that

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.570 align:middle line:84%
had a degree of
credibility, to say nothing

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:44.330 align:middle line:84%
of an incredible array of
physical photographs and film

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:45.650 align:middle line:90%
that are not to be denied.

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:48.364 align:middle line:84%
So the military has known about
this, obviously, all along.

00:49:48.364 --> 00:49:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Oh, yes.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We know that
from before Roswell on.

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:52.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to get into
the world of a little more fact

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:56.270 align:middle line:90%
or fiction.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Mm hmm.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So there's a story,
and this story

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:03.479 align:middle line:84%
was by Desmond Leslie told
Lieutenant Phillip Corso--

00:50:03.479 --> 00:50:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Yeah.

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --that Adamski didn't
have a normal belly button,

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and he was somehow physically
different from other humans,

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that often ETs don't
have belly buttons.

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So now what do you and your
father have to say about that?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see
his belly button?

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: First of all, the
reason that I'm reluctant with

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:32.740 align:middle line:84%
this story is because it is
these type of things that are

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:38.100 align:middle line:84%
easily magnified out of context
and easily misinterpreted

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.330 align:middle line:90%
and misunderstood.

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.710 align:middle line:90%
George had a symbol.

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.130 align:middle line:84%
That symbol existed
while he was alive.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:49.320 align:middle line:84%
When he passed away,
so did the symbol.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And this was witnessed on his
body after his heart attack

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.900 align:middle line:90%
and before his cremation in '65.

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And so basically,
to make a long story short,

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.900 align:middle line:84%
when you are the
living representation

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:16.860 align:middle line:84%
of the principles and
the example of that,

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:21.880 align:middle line:84%
then you can carry
some of those markings.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
don't like to say

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.750 align:middle line:84%
this is because over the
years and having been involved

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:30.160 align:middle line:84%
with this subject for half
a century, most of my life,

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.190 align:middle line:84%
I have gone and
been at conferences

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and I have seen people who
run around with bleeding hands

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and things like that
that say that they

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:43.080 align:middle line:84%
are receiving the
wounds of Jesus.

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, if anybody truly knows
and remembers our history,

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.180 align:middle line:84%
he was not nailed
through the hands.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.870 align:middle line:84%
You're nailed
through the wrists.

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Crucifixion was through the
wrists and through the bones

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.500 align:middle line:84%
here in the ankle, a
very nasty business.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And so while these
people have run around

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to mime certain things in
order to get notoriety,

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.110 align:middle line:84%
they weren't even
historically correct

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:08.330 align:middle line:90%
in what they were miming.

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:09.549 align:middle line:90%
So what I'm saying--

00:52:09.549 --> 00:52:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What was the symbol?

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.298 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: --is
that the symbol,

00:52:12.298 --> 00:52:17.010 align:middle line:84%
in the past I have told
people that it's irrelevant.

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:19.980 align:middle line:90%
And in reality, it is.

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Because for those
who don't understand,

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:24.720 align:middle line:84%
they will blow this
out of context.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not really
an indicator of who

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:31.710 align:middle line:90%
and what he was.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Still, it
had to be brought up,

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.960 align:middle line:84%
because the stories
are out there.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: True.

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.260 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
couple minutes left.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.386 align:middle line:84%
We've covered a great
amount of topics in depth.

00:52:43.386 --> 00:52:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
else you wanted

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.821 align:middle line:84%
to add to this that we--
there's so much more.

00:52:46.821 --> 00:52:47.570 align:middle line:90%
There are volumes.

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Oh, yeah.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:48.566 align:middle line:90%
There's volumes.

00:52:48.566 --> 00:52:50.733 align:middle line:84%
We could do hours of tapes,
and we have in the past.

00:52:50.733 --> 00:52:51.482 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:52:51.482 --> 00:52:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But for this,
anything else you'd

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:56.500 align:middle line:84%
like to add as a
final statement?

00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: This
subject is like an onion,

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and there's multiple layers
to its level of representation

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.710 align:middle line:90%
and its level of understanding.

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:13.330 align:middle line:84%
On the peripheral,
we have things

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:15.720 align:middle line:84%
like the conventions
that we go to

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and the public relation events,
occasionally such things

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:21.740 align:middle line:84%
like the disclosure hearings,
which, to a certain degree,

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I was severely
disappointed on what

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:28.490 align:middle line:84%
was talked about and the
rehashing of old agendas.

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You talking
about 2001 or '13?

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: This
one just recently.

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And so this is
the outer layers of the onion.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And as you progress
into inner ones,

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:42.030 align:middle line:84%
you can progress
to the point where

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.474 align:middle line:84%
you can talk to the next
level of understanding.

00:53:44.474 --> 00:53:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So you'll have
some officials that

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:49.180 align:middle line:84%
are public about
their disclosures,

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:52.820 align:middle line:84%
such as Gordon Cooper, Edgar
Mitchell, Maurice Chatelain.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:55.050 align:middle line:84%
You have these people who
came forward and willing

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:57.210 align:middle line:90%
to talk to a certain degree.

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Then you go to a
deeper level where

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:01.110 align:middle line:84%
you have some scientific
communities that

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:03.890 align:middle line:84%
are working and
trying to educate us

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:06.640 align:middle line:84%
in a way that will develop the
understanding the same way.

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to be necessarily

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:11.220 align:middle line:90%
through the subject of UFOs.

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you continue
to go deeper and deeper.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And I can only say that our
family has been extremely

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:22.350 align:middle line:84%
fortunate because
we came from a time

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and interaction and
contacts with George

00:54:25.850 --> 00:54:27.300 align:middle line:90%
that were directly related.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to visibly
see some of the ships

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.980 align:middle line:84%
with him, interact
with some of the people

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that were his
contacts, and we were

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:40.350 align:middle line:84%
able to carry that forth
for many years thereafter.

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And that has nothing
to do with me.

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.540 align:middle line:84%
That has to do with
their desire to have

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.440 align:middle line:84%
a conduit of
information available,

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.610 align:middle line:84%
which my father made himself
easily available towards.

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And so when my parents
and Mrs. Rotifer

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.790 align:middle line:84%
went to NASA in '67
before 22 scientists,

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:01.700 align:middle line:84%
it's important for people
to realize that, one, they

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:05.670 align:middle line:84%
knew how the ships worked,
where they come from,

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:06.890 align:middle line:90%
who pilots them.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:08.860 align:middle line:90%
This was no secret to them.

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:12.430 align:middle line:84%
They were interested
in the use of telepathy

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and how it can be used
communication-wise.

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.620 align:middle line:84%
They used it as a backup
for the Apollo program

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.150 align:middle line:90%
with the astronauts.

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were interested in how
many space people, human space

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.190 align:middle line:84%
people from other planets
in our solar system,

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:28.180 align:middle line:90%
were actively visiting us.

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And they were given a
number, in which they also

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.850 align:middle line:84%
had the same number, so they
were satisfied that they

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:35.300 align:middle line:84%
were getting
accurate information.

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ballpark figures?

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:38.122 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Unimportant.

00:55:38.122 --> 00:55:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS] OK.

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And this
interaction shows that

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:52.770 align:middle line:84%
officially there is much more
recognition that cuts away

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:59.370 align:middle line:84%
the layers of all this outside
nonsense that is so easily used

00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:03.340 align:middle line:84%
as lures to pull us in and
that there is true information

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:03.890 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:05.820 align:middle line:84%
The other day in the
conventional hall,

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I heard this statement,
and I walked around--

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:10.440 align:middle line:84%
because this is how I
compose my lectures, by going

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.480 align:middle line:84%
around and listening to what the
trends going on-- and I hear,

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.310 align:middle line:84%
well, everything
is hidden from you.

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.010 align:middle line:90%
There's no truth.

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It's conspiracy
this, mysticism this.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.440 align:middle line:90%
And all of that's not true.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.120 align:middle line:90%
The truth is available for you.

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.820 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's not out there.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:26.340 align:middle line:90%
It's in front of your face.

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Two, nothing is held
from you if you really

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:31.730 align:middle line:90%
are looking to find it.

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Knock and the door
shall be opened.

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:37.080 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to know
what you're looking for.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.746 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let me ask
you at this point,

00:56:38.746 --> 00:56:41.670 align:middle line:84%
because we're about out of
time, what would you recommend

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:45.875 align:middle line:84%
as the best of Adamski's work
for people to connect with?

00:56:45.875 --> 00:56:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well, what
we do is we made the first

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.690 align:middle line:84%
publication, "Flying
Saucers Have Landed,"

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:53.770 align:middle line:84%
which has the contact in it,
and we combined it with "Inside

00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.700 align:middle line:84%
the Spaceships"
into one edition.

00:56:55.700 --> 00:57:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I think this gives people a
general introduction of George

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.912 align:middle line:84%
and, as you talked
about, his interactions

00:57:01.912 --> 00:57:03.120 align:middle line:90%
in the ships with the people.

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: He
describes the people.

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:07.090 align:middle line:84%
He describes a meeting with
some of the teachers there

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and some of the lessons
that were given by.

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.981 align:middle line:84%
I think that is very good
information for people.

00:57:10.981 --> 00:57:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Website.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING:
Adamskifoundation.com.

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.696 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: And all that
material is available there.

00:57:16.696 --> 00:57:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you've
just opened the door.

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:20.880 align:middle line:84%
We've barely scratched
any surface at all here.

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But what we have done
I very much appreciate.

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It's been lovely, and
it has good depth to it.

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING:
You're very welcome.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's what I like.

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> STECKLING: Well, I'd be more
than happy to give you any more

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:30.885 align:middle line:90%
information you need.

00:57:30.885 --> 00:57:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:32.675 align:middle line:90%
>> STECKLING: Selectively.

00:57:32.675 --> 00:57:33.258 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:57:33.258 --> 00:57:34.100 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:36.915 align:middle line:84%
