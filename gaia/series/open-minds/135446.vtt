>>REGINA MEREDITH: What
do fluoride, Hitler,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:10%
and HAARP have in common?

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:10%
They're all co-factors
in what has become known

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:10%
as societal brain entrainment.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Many wondered how this may have
played out in the infamous 2016

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:84%
presidential election as
an amazing level of discord

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:90%
emerged.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Adam Trombly, of Project
Earth, is here with us today

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:84%
to speak about the means
by which our minds have

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:90%
been subdued en masse.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.159 align:middle line:84%
And this is something you've
been studying for a long time.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go into
the deep, deep history

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:90%
and implications of it.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But before we do
that, I mean everybody

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:84%
has been focusing on
how our society is going

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:84%
to be forced into
change as a result

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of the presidential
election, and Trump

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:90%
coming into the presidency.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:90%
But let's go back.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you and I talked
right after that election

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and you said that there was
an amazing level of brain

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:84%
entrainment when
Obama was elected.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Because this isn't a
political conversation,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.777 align:middle line:84%
this is a conversation
about societal manipulation.

00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAM TROMBLY: Yeah, I
mean, from my perspective,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.857 align:middle line:90%
it's just data.

00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just data.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at it
that way toward an end.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Right.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:10%
>>TROMBLY: And basically we've
been watching entrainment

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:10%
and commercials and political
elections going back--

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What's that look like?

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Is it an advantage?

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: It shows up
on a spectrum analyzer.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.734 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
does it look like?

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:10%
>>TROMBLY: It
looks like repeated

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:10%
anthropogenic
waveforms basically,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:10%
intermodulated on the waveform
that is the broadcast.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's an additional
layer of information,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:90%
of a frequency-based nature?

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yeah.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:90%
It's frequency.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:84%
As humans, we have
something called

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:90%
frequency following response.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of our genetics.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So when we have
exposure, when we've

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to repeated
frequencies, repeated sounds,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.650 align:middle line:84%
our brains tend to go into
synchronization with those

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:90%
sounds for good or for bad.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is why
companies have mottos,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and political candidates
have mottos, slogans.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yeah.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the root
of mantra ultimately.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean this is just
as you're saying, this is data.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.330 align:middle line:90%
This can be used for elevation.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And it can be used
for the reverse.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.912 align:middle line:84%
So when you saw that in there,
what was your understanding?

00:02:48.912 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
How did you interpret
that when you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:84%
started noticing
these on this spectrum

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:90%
analyzer in the ads themselves?

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:90%
What did that tell you?

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: We knew,
for example, that one

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
we frequently saw

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:84%
was called the Lilly
Wave which was actually

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:90%
invented by John Lilly.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And when he was
visiting us in 1990--

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.910 align:middle line:84%
without going into a
big story about it--

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
but he saw something
as I was booting up

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
one of the instruments
in the morning.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said where is it
waveform from coming from?

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said it's coming from
the harness of our house

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:90%
and from the electrical grid.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.392 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, it can't be.

00:03:23.392 --> 00:03:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not
supposed to be there.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: And I said, why not.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I never even thought
about what that waveform

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.896 align:middle line:90%
was to tell you the truth.

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.780 align:middle line:90%
That's the honest to god truth.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
It was just there in the
boot up process, you know.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:90%
He says that's a Lilly Wave.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And he invented
the Lilly Wave when

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the National
Institutes of Health,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
under contract with the US
Navy was implanting electrodes

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:90%
into dolphin's brains.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered that
dolphins cannot be stimulated

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.830 align:middle line:84%
by sine waves because they
would go into seizures,

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
because their brains
actually work.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%
And that took processing time.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So he had to give a
response pause, which

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:90%
he called the response vector.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a wave and
then you have this pause

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the [ZZZT]
then you have a pause.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
pause allows the brain

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
a chance to catch
up with the data

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:90%
without going into seizure.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Exactly.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK so now looking at
this in the commercials, what

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:90%
were you seeing?

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well we, also,
having decent brains

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
that we don't use enough
most of the time, we also

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.190 align:middle line:84%
actually have a response
vector it turns out.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
We're much more responsive
to the Lilly Wave

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.577 align:middle line:90%
than we are to sine waves.

00:04:35.577 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But not as
responsive as dolphins.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Most humans, no.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:84%
But actually we
are, we're actually

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:84%
more responsive than
dolphins in some ways

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
when it's done
properly, because we

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.951 align:middle line:84%
have greater foliation in our
neural structure in our brains.

00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Foliation as
in foliage and branching,

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:90%
aberrations.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yes.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Foliation aberration.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And basically, so
if you do it right

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and you intermodulate correctly,
then our brains really

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:90%
respond to the Lilly Wave.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is on the
harness of our houses,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:90%
we discovered this that day.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is a
harness of a house?

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: The
electrical harness.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.866 align:middle line:84%
The electrical
harness of a house.

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:19.012 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And that means
that it's on the grid.

00:05:19.012 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere we've
measured in the country,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.787 align:middle line:90%
we've found Lilly Wave.

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So wouldn't
you say it would

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:84%
be totally natural that it would
be embedded in that commercial?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Or is that special?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:90%
Is that intentionally embedded?

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well,
actually, we hadn't

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:84%
found that before John
explained the Lilly Wave,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:90%
we didn't even see that.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So it was like once he did
that, we started looking.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:90%
So that was 1990.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:90%
And we started looking.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at everything.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at TV signals.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.919 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at HAARP.

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at everything.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.793 align:middle line:84%
I mean by the time we
were looking at HAARP,

00:05:53.793 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:90%
it was '93, '94.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered incredible,
incredible entrainment

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.890 align:middle line:84%
algorithms being played
out through these very

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated broadcasts,
especially from HAARP.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:84%
The most unbelievable broadcast
I've ever seen in my life,

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:90%
and that was 22 years ago.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And we know that they've had a
lot of time to fiddle with it

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.733 align:middle line:84%
and upgrade these
technologies and make them

00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
more effective and less
detectable, theoretically,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:90%
over the last 26 years.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're more dastardly
now, certainly more

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:90%
stealth-like in a sense.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: It is very
stealth-like because when

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
subliminals were outlawed
in commercials back

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s, when they were
flash flames where they said

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.366 align:middle line:90%
buy this and stuff like that.

00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pack of cigarettes.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.796 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yeah.

00:06:38.796 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And other things
that we won't even

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
get into, but the
fact of the matter

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:84%
is that when they
discovered that they

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.331 align:middle line:84%
could use frequency following
response to entrain people

00:06:48.331 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
while they were
watching commercials

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:90%
to get them to buy things.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.331 align:middle line:84%
This was actually had
Lilly over the top

00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:84%
when he found out
this was going on.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:84%
When John heard
about this, he just

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:84%
went-- he says I
knew somebody was

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:90%
going to abuse this technology.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:90%
And they were not just using--

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.595 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well one might
argue they were abusing it

00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:10.400 align:middle line:84%
by doing this to dolphins,
but that's a second argument.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well we
know how, for example,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.160 align:middle line:84%
in the lab at Monroe
Institute, this whole spectrum

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.661 align:middle line:84%
of signatures has been explored
in terms of the integration.

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:21.076 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to go there,

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:84%
by the way, and your
experience with them.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.746 align:middle line:90%
In just a little bit.

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to get back
to what we saw

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:90%
embedded in those commercials.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Good.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you have
this situation where

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:90%
people are watching something.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And we know how to-- they,
not we-- but somebody

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
knows how to stimulate
the pleasure center

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:84%
by intermodulating the sound
and the light in such a way

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that the brain, without any
consciousness of it whatsoever,

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.514 align:middle line:84%
suddenly feels like
I want to buy that.

00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
vote for him or her.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: That's going
to give me more pleasure.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even like it's
going to give me more pleasure

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.955 align:middle line:84%
consciously, it's just
like all of a sudden I

00:07:56.955 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:84%
want it because I feel
this pleasure that moment.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're saying
the Obama campaign was

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.380 align:middle line:90%
using that technology.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.796 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: The most unbelievably
sophisticated entrainment

00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:84%
technology that-- and
people were calling me

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
up from various
places because I've

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:90%
been lecturing a long time.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the
initiator of this.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:90%
People were looking into this.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And then when John informed
me about the Lilly Wave,

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:90%
they got into it.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said I picked up the phone
and I called a bunch of people

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and I said guess what, it's on
the harnesses of our houses,

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's coordinated
like intermodulation

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
is coordinated during
various events,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
for example, like
the Super Bowl.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:84%
You have millions and
millions of people watching

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
a specific event and you
want a specific outcome

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:90%
from an election, let's say.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
necessarily the outcome

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:90%
that people are expecting.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:90%
But you want a program it in.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about this election.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And also going back all the
way to Obama, because we

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:90%
have the illusion of democracy.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:90%
We don't really have democracy.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I think most people know
that the democracy is

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.100 align:middle line:90%
kind of a sham.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.067 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry to say.

00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:12.942 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no, no.

00:09:12.942 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I think viewing this
understand the reality of that.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: So just like
people buy products

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.690 align:middle line:84%
without even knowing why they're
buying them half the time,

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
people vote for people
without even really knowing

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:90%
why they're voting for people.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do both sides
use the same technology?

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yes.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does
that occur if you're

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.280 align:middle line:84%
looking at a vested interest
from, say, some ruling

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
elite at the top and they
have an interest in one

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
party versus the other
winning the election?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Why would both
parties have access

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:84%
to this incredibly
sophisticated technology?

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well, it used to be
only the Republicans used it.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, with Obama, the
Democrats started using it.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.850 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time
we ever saw it used.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how do they
even get access to it?

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.418 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well how
they got access to it

00:09:57.418 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:90%
is a mystery to me.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean I can't say.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I'm saying
I can see if you have a glo--

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:90%
and I know it's not this neat.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I know that this whole
notion of global elite

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:84%
is a messy, contradictory
affair in a lot of ways--

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:84%
but we do know
there are those who

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
choose to imprint
certain messages

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.230 align:middle line:90%
and feelings upon society.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:90%
We know this in general.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: So a
sequence of events.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:84%
John Lilly in 1959 discovers
the Lilly Wave, discovered

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that was effective
against-- or not against,

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
but in relationship to dolphin
behavior with electro-implants

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:90%
in their brains.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Starts there, 1959,
it's a long time ago.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And somebody goes,
oh, look at this,

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.080 align:middle line:90%
will this work with humans?

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And so somebody
does an experiment

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:90%
to see if it works with humans.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Now we've been studying
frequency following response

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:84%
since after World War II
because where it really started

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:84%
was in the '30s in
Germany when they

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
were developing the EEG,
the electroencephalogram.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
developing the EEG,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
basically, they discovered
alpha entrainment.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
They discovered that
they can manipulate

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and they've discovered
brainwaves, basically.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they discovered they
could manipulate brainwaves.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And even like the
stadiums were rebuilt.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.659 align:middle line:84%
Albert Speer was the
architect, Hitler's architect.

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For the famous
Hitler's speeches.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Nuremberg.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And that stadium was
acoustically redone.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So that everybody
standing in there

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.780 align:middle line:84%
in their neat little
semi-conductor looking rows

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:90%
were completely alpha entrained.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:84%
They were having this
pleasurable experience

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.840 align:middle line:90%
of listening to Hitler.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was then extended
into the radio broadcast.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wait, one minute.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:84%
You and I talked off camera
about this at one time.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:84%
You said it wasn't
just the crowd.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Hitler himself was being
stimulated into this--

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Oh, you bet.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
He was being hyper
stimulated, yeah.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:84%
They had put him in
a diaper actually.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's a fact.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's remarkable that they
were able to-- even when things

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
started going badly-- they
started taking the fluoride out

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of the-- they used
fluoride experimentally

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
in the concentration camps and
figured that wow this really

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%
helps placate our inmates, calms
him down, makes him impotent,

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
makes him sterile,
completely makes him sterile.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And so those guys
won't be reproducing.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:90%
They won't be misbehaving.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.550 align:middle line:84%
We need fluoride in the
water, also, now for the Reich

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.196 align:middle line:90%
because the Reich's collapsing.

00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So they started
putting it in the water

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.985 align:middle line:90%
so that people wouldn't panic.

00:12:37.985 --> 00:12:39.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wouldn't
rise up or panic.

00:12:39.485 --> 00:12:41.289 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: That's right.

00:12:41.289 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was that the
beginning of fluoridation?

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: That was begging.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
public water supplies.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: That is really
the beginning of fluoridation

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:90%
in the public water supply.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
who make claims

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that there is an experiment
done in this country.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But in point of fact,
this is going back

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
to the early days of
the whole program.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So they had fluoridation in the
water which subdues the ability

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
to really function and think
clearly even on one level.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:84%
It just takes it
down a notch, right?

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yes.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same time,
they were using this other kind

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:90%
of EEG stimulation, right?

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yes.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To the crowds.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: So EEG stimulation,
by frequency following response

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:84%
in the broadcasts-- so
they would have propaganda

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:90%
broadcasts being broadcast.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.211 align:middle line:84%
And they would be in radio
broadcasts and everything.

00:13:27.211 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was binaural,
and some people think because--

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not
binaural, monaural.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: They think
because of Hemi-Sync

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:84%
that you have to have
it be like binaural.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But, actually, one of the
things that you can do,

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.300 align:middle line:84%
if you know how to do
it, is you can actually

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:84%
take a monaural signal and you
can create a binaural beat,

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:90%
even with a monaural signal.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:48.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
were essentially--

00:13:48.655 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Slightly out of
phase on the same broadcast.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
getting that same effect.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yes.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:90%
They were getting that effect.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:90%
So the Republicans programmed--

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And they, of course,
had no idea, none whatsoever.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now we're
what 50, 60, 70 years

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.480 align:middle line:90%
past the understanding of that.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And our processing
power and everything else,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:90%
you add all of that.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:84%
When a colleague of mine,
former colleague of mine,

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.070 align:middle line:84%
called me up-- and this is very
relevant to this whole thing--

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and said you've got to
see what I'm seeing.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
The entrainment
extends to HAARP.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But HAARP isn't
just-- there's not

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:84%
just one ionospheric heater,
our ionospheric heater, which

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.080 align:middle line:84%
we built to defend
ourselves partially

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:84%
against other ionospheric
heaters in the world.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:39.641 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line is that
once this got really going,

00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and people realized what you
could really do with it--

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With HAARP?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: With HAARP
and other such things.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.726 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well
Woodpecker out of Russia?

00:14:46.726 --> 00:14:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Started
it out, that's

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.850 align:middle line:90%
where it was first discovered.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It was actually something that
Tesla had proposed as a weapon.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And that was picked up on
by the Soviet government

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.180 align:middle line:84%
because Tesla was feeling
very isolated and very

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
disenfranchised by our
government isolated

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:90%
in his hotel room.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
correspondence that occurred.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And in point of fact, they did
all kinds of experimentation.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I worked with the Yull
Brown-- whose real name

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:84%
isn't Yull Brown,
by the way-- but who

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
is famous for
so-called Brown's gas,

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:84%
the stoichiometric mixture
of hydrogen and oxygen.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And in point of fact,
what he told me was

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:84%
they could take a theater full
of people watching a romance.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And they would run out of the
theater horrified because they

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.250 align:middle line:84%
had fight or flight from a
romance, from people kissing,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:84%
because they were
able to induce that

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:84%
through the intermodulation
of the sound wave right

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:90%
into the brains of the audience.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, he was an
engineer in Germany, right?

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Oh, yeah.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And were they
conducting these experiments

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.562 align:middle line:90%
with him or on him?

00:15:58.562 --> 00:16:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: No he was
actually an engineer

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:84%
who had been released
from the Gulag

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.505 align:middle line:84%
because he had been a
Nazi during World War II.

00:16:05.505 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Then they discovered that he was
also a very brilliant engineer.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:90%
And so they brought him in.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And they said, why
don't you work for us.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.834 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, this is a
lot better than the Gulag.

00:16:15.834 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And the plot thickens when we
move up in time a little bit

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and as-- I saw a film called oh,
god "Something the Woodpecker"

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:90%
you can go online and find it.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I saw it a film festival.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.624 align:middle line:84%
It must be out there somewhere,
but the Russian woodpecker.

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And people can take
a look at that film.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And it is a wild artist,
brilliant, but he's an artist.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
all over the place.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But, essentially-- and I'd like
to run this by you because I

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:84%
haven't asked anybody--
what he is saying

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:49.334 align:middle line:84%
is that Chernobyl
was allowed to occur.

00:16:49.334 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:90%
They knew what was going on.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:90%
They key people were informed.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:84%
They each chose to ignore what
had to be ignored at the moment

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
so the meltdown could
occur, because the meltdown

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:84%
was directly impacting
the now malfunctioning

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Russian woodpecker.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was going to be some
findings of either malfeasance

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.400 align:middle line:84%
or negligence on the part of the
Russian government, those who

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.810 align:middle line:90%
were operating the Woodpecker.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.518 align:middle line:84%
So they just kind of
blew the whole thing

00:17:15.518 --> 00:17:18.012 align:middle line:84%
with the frequencies
from Chernobyl.

00:17:18.012 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard
anything about that?

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.079 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: No.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.941 align:middle line:84%
Let's go let's move
on down the road.

00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating idea.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.790 align:middle line:84%
They said it was used as a
cover to obscure and get rid

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:90%
of the whole Woodpecker.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.666 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: All I can
say about Chernobyl

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is there were signs of
instabilities for months

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:90%
And they were ignored.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Just like signs of
instabilities at Fukushima,

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.940 align:middle line:84%
prior to the tsunami,
were ignored.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.198 align:middle line:84%
So that's a whole other can of
worms, but it's interesting.

00:17:43.198 --> 00:17:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: It's a
huge can of worms.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it all
goes together somehow.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: It all goes
together completely.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.624 align:middle line:84%
So that you have to take up and
start researching on your own.

00:17:51.624 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But see if you can
find that documentary

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
"The Russian Woodpecker."

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:90%
So now let's go back.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.464 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking about the
use of these frequencies.

00:17:59.464 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:84%
You've built your
own HAARP device

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:84%
to counter HAARP kind of into
your own ionospheric heater

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:84%
to stop any intrusion
from these frequencies.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.376 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: No, no, no.

00:18:08.376 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:84%
The HAARP itself is
an ionospheric heater.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.655 align:middle line:84%
What we did was we
actually-- I had--

00:18:13.655 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was anti
ionospheric heater device?

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: No, no.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a spectrum analyzer
so we could see everything.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh I see.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: We could
see everything from DC.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that time up through 38
gigahertz in high resolution.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:84%
The instruments now
go way above band,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
but they've cut off-- almost all
the instruments you can buy now

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.899 align:middle line:90%
are cut off below 9 kilohertz.

00:18:33.899 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you can't measure.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: There's this
whole extremely low frequency

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.220 align:middle line:84%
the bottom of the
very low frequency.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.415 align:middle line:84%
But the extremely low
frequency is almost completely

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:44.215 align:middle line:90%
impossible.

00:18:44.215 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.326 align:middle line:84%
We need to go back
to the implications--

00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: This is
important for entrainment.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do they use
these ultra-low frequencies?

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well we function in
the extremely low frequency,

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:90%
our metabolism.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And so entrainment
happens within this part

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:90%
of the spectrum.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:84%
That you can't see now
in spectrum analyzer

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:84%
you buy from Tektronix or
all of these other companies.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can't
detect what's going on.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: You can't see it.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Because unless you know about
the analogs and the harmonics

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and subharmonics,
and once you know

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that there are subharmonics,
et cetera, going upband.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Look, we found intermodulation
for DNA in 1994.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:90%
You know, I mean double helix.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Double helix marching across.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But explain
in these common terms

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.252 align:middle line:84%
what the net effect
of that would be.

00:19:33.252 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: What the net
effect of that would be

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
is that you could
trigger mutations

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:90%
and/or genetic disease.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's been out
there for how many years?

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well at
least since 1994.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At least since 1994.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.289 align:middle line:84%
And can be used at will
and in targeted areas

00:19:47.289 --> 00:19:48.580 align:middle line:90%
with targeted groups of people.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Right.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Which was before the
public announcement

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
of the full genome,
which, obviously,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:84%
somebody already had access
to in order to do that work.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing,
because it was

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:84%
on the frequencies of the
DNA molecule as a waveguide.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.290 align:middle line:84%
It was on the frequency
of the chromosome

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
in its relaxed and excited
state and preparing et cetera.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
There was a whole spectrum
and incredibly sophisticated

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is
electromagnetically induced,

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.900 align:middle line:84%
so this is the other
component of this.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Water molecules
in our bodies can

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:84%
respond to extremely weak
magnetic electromagnetic

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:90%
signals.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Extremely weak.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, you
can induce changes

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
with very little
amplitude in the field.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you can
have this broadcast

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:84%
which broadcasts 100
megawatts into the ionosphere.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And then that gets
multiplied by 1,000 according

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:90%
to Eastland who invented it.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
With the Russians who were
working in companionship,

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I recall.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:56.734 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well he certainly
used some Russian research.

00:20:56.734 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
reading that.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yeah.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So and he finally acknowledged
on camera at one point

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
that HAARP also was a
biological warfare weapon.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So and this
would make sense.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you look at just
classic homeopathy, right?

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.940 align:middle line:84%
It's information being
relayed from practically none

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of an original substance,
very, very low amounts of data

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.890 align:middle line:84%
in the homeopathic substance to
inform the water in the body.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Exactly.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:27.496 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then that in
effect informs everything else.

00:21:27.496 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:90%
So you can do it with that.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:84%
You can do it with
electromagnetic frequencies.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.975 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: I mean
what's a virus?

00:21:31.975 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
A virus is this incredible
small thing that

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.926 align:middle line:90%
suddenly disrupts a metabolism.

00:21:36.926 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
begs another question

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and that is do you
know of any evidence

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:47.010 align:middle line:84%
of very specific targeted
people or regions of the world.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Areas in which genetic
defects of a particular kind--

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Anybody
can be targeted.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Once somebody has follicular
hair or some other DNA sample,

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:84%
once you have the full
DNA of an individual,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:90%
you can target them very easily.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was obvious to
us in 1994 that they

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:84%
were targeting somebody because
this was DNA marching across

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:14.050 align:middle line:84%
with-- you know I spent a lot
of time looking at chromosomes

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:90%
and DNA.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.250 align:middle line:84%
My sister was a biochemist,
biophysicist, and a geneticist.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't go
off of that tangent.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.776 align:middle line:84%
Now before we go
off there, I want

00:22:22.776 --> 00:22:24.392 align:middle line:84%
to go back to the
Monroe Institute

00:22:24.392 --> 00:22:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and the binaural beats.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of entrainment,
because theoretically-- I mean,

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:84%
not theoretically,
Bob Monroe was

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
working to find ways in which
we could enhance our function.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Sure.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So at some
point, in the early stages,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I believe you knew
Bob Monroe, right?

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: I met him in 1987.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what was happening then.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Using binaural beats, trying
to use them in a new way.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
experimentation being done.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Oh yeah.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:53.686 align:middle line:90%
The Munroe Institute--

00:22:53.686 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is Hemi-Sync
because I think most

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.406 align:middle line:90%
our viewers know of Hemi-Sync.

00:22:57.406 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Yeah,
hemispheric synchronization.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:90%
I met Bob in 1987.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced by
Dr. Lee Sannella,

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:84%
who is a psychiatrist and
a neurophysiologist, Yale

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:90%
educated.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.242 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one who
Bob called as a therapist

00:23:13.242 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
when he first started having
out of body experiences,

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:84%
when he was experimenting
with his loudspeakers.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Because he was developing
loudspeakers at this land

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:90%
he bought.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.310 align:middle line:84%
He was the chief engineer for
National Broadcasting for NBC.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And so he was
making decent money.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.170 align:middle line:84%
He bought some land
in Faber, Virginia.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And he started experimenting
with his loudspeakers.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.239 align:middle line:84%
It was the early days when
you're finding the sweet spot.

00:23:36.239 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Blasting himself
right out of his body.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And the test tones
on and he found his face pressed

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.870 align:middle line:90%
up against the ceiling.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.055 align:middle line:84%
And he thought he
was going crazy.

00:23:45.055 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, Lee said no,
every culture until now

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
has had a tradition of
out of body experiences.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And so he felt very assured
that this incredibly credible

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:84%
individual with great government
creds and everything else,

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:90%
too, was saying you're OK.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:90%
We need to look into this.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And so Bob started
exploring how to make

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:90%
it happen intentionally.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And that ended up becoming
hemispheric synchronization

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:84%
where he discovered
a way to coordinate

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
both the left and
the right hemispheres

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:84%
of the brain in such a way
that they go into resonance.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:90%
They go into total resonance.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.137 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I
got there in 1987,

00:24:26.137 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:84%
they'd already gotten to the
point where they could have

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:84%
everything from the
hippocampus, everything

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.260 align:middle line:84%
from the pineal and the
pituitary, everything,

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:84%
the corpus callosum, the
medulla, the cerebellum,

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.720 align:middle line:84%
the entire cerebral cortex
goes into resonance.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And it is the most amazing
thing when it's done right.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Because all of a
sudden your IQ goes up

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.460 align:middle line:84%
many, many, many,
many, many points.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And you start seeing
and understanding things

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:84%
differently, if you get
it, if you go into sync.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just about
leaving your body,

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you that much.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.959 align:middle line:84%
And so once I experienced
that in '87, I was like--

00:25:03.959 --> 00:25:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is a holy grail.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: I said I
volunteer and I will

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:90%
help promote this worldwide.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And in interviews I would talk
about it and things like that.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Bob and I became good friends.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I introduced him to
John Lilly and whatever.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.710 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is that
it was all about frequency

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:90%
following response.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And it still is and benign
ways of applying it.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Including, by the way, in
classrooms where Hemi-Sync

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:84%
was applied to classrooms
full of ADD children who

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.626 align:middle line:84%
were taken off of drugs
completely after six weeks.

00:25:35.626 --> 00:25:36.916 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:25:36.916 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural thing to do.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And their IQs, on
average, jumped 20 points.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Now this gets me
to a point that-- I

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:84%
think by this time a lot of the
viewers will be saying, hey,

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing that we're being
blasted with all this stuff.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
We're being manipulated
in insidious ways.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And my guess is there's probably
very few, if any, situations

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.050 align:middle line:84%
in which this technology is
being employed to enhance

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:06.240 align:middle line:90%
humanity's experience.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.835 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Not unless it
has a strategic advantage.

00:26:08.835 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, there you go.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: OK.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:84%
you want a pilot to be
able to concentrate?

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.675 align:middle line:90%
You use Hemi-Sync.

00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I'm talking
about the nefarious stuff

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.570 align:middle line:84%
we find in the advertising
and in the field.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:19.736 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: No, I understand.

00:26:19.736 --> 00:26:21.730 align:middle line:84%
No, I was just saying
there is also that.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
The nefarious stuff we
find in the field is

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.680 align:middle line:90%
pretty wide ranging.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.454 align:middle line:84%
It's not that every
major corporation has

00:26:27.454 --> 00:26:28.620 align:middle line:90%
this kind of sophistication.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I
wouldn't think so.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.500 align:middle line:90%
But the point is--

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: But the networks do.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And the networks and Department
of Homeland Security do.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And Department of
Homeland Security

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.614 align:middle line:84%
monitors all the
national feeds now.

00:26:41.614 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yeah.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And there is a great
deal of sophistication.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you
there's sophistication

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:90%
at NSA level and CIA level.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying this
is just it's all bad.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like you have to understand
this stuff in this day

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and age when we have 50
petaflop computers running.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's 50,000 trillion-- I
mean it's like a petaflop is--

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It goes into numbers
that start with a G or a Z

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:90%
or something, right?

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: A petaflop is
1,000 trillion floating point

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:90%
operations a second.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:90%
And we have 50 trillion.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Cray's
coming out with one

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.370 align:middle line:84%
next year I think it's
170 trillion in 2017.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
are specifically--

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.469 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: 170 petaflops.

00:27:29.469 --> 00:27:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
are being employed how?

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And that's
in the public domain.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what's known
in the public.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you have 30
years ahead of time.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:90%
And the stuff that's going on.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Black Ops, yeah.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yeah.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the level
of sophistication

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that is occurring right
now in all of this

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:90%
is really remarkable.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Why would people do this to
other people is the question.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.390 align:middle line:90%
If I may.

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you may
please now go down,

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.130 align:middle line:90%
let's go down that road.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.546 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Why
would they do that?

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, going back to
Nazi Germany, the people who

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.030 align:middle line:84%
originally were working
with the development

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:84%
of the electroencephalogram
were not

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:84%
intending to manipulate
people and change

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:90%
their mood and their politics.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:16.790 align:middle line:84%
But an aggressive parasitic
type of personality saw this

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and heard about it and said,
oh, can we use it for this?

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Like you put Goebbels
together with entrainment

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and you get really
effective propaganda.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.266 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
people are Sieg

00:28:29.266 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:90%
Heiling all over the place.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:90%
And they don't even know.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.743 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
know why they're doing.

00:28:33.743 --> 00:28:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: It's a
physiological response

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.060 align:middle line:90%
that's actually subconscious.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's like they feel
joy and enthusiasm.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's a good thing
that's happening because

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:84%
of destabilization of the
magnetic field of our planet,

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:84%
which is incredibly
unstable right now--

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:90%
and getting more so every day.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.115 align:middle line:84%
Exponentially over the
last several years,

00:28:57.115 --> 00:28:59.240 align:middle line:84%
the dipole moment of this
planet has been decaying,

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.614 align:middle line:84%
but that's a whole
other subject,

00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:84%
except for how it
relates to this.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.410 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming harder and harder
to keep people entrained.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
is a good thing.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:90%
The entrainment isn't holding.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not really having its
intended effect on us now

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.990 align:middle line:90%
like it used to.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Not as much.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Acutely, it still has
a big impact people.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Watch the World Series.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.720 align:middle line:90%
People watch the Super Bowl.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.830 align:middle line:84%
People watch some kind of
political campaign event

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Or they're in the stadium
where we discovered

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:90%
the level of sophistication.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't really me.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:84%
A group of people were in
Oregon in a stadium in Portland

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.640 align:middle line:84%
when Barack Obama
spoke there in 2008.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And they had really good
digital, very high definition

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:84%
for the time, actually,
extraordinary for the time.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.312 align:middle line:84%
And they were in an
experimental phase--

00:29:51.312 --> 00:29:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some kind of
spectrum analyzer again?

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well no, these
are actually microphones.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But they're incredibly sensitive
Piezo digital microphones

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.869 align:middle line:84%
with really good resolution,
really high resolution.

00:30:01.869 --> 00:30:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And some people would
say well wouldn't you

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:90%
want to have analog?

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Well a lot of this is
digital information.

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's being
triggered into our cells

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.156 align:middle line:90%
and in step wise manner.

00:30:11.156 --> 00:30:13.467 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What did they find?

00:30:13.467 --> 00:30:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: I just got this call.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.966 align:middle line:84%
And you know so I didn't
even know this is going on.

00:30:16.966 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:84%
This guy called me he said, god,
I'm going to vote for Obama.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said you're going
to vote for Obama?

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.054 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah,
and I said wow.

00:30:25.054 --> 00:30:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a
flip-flop apparently.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: I said you are
the most Republican Oregonian

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I have ever known
in my entire life.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying you're
going to vote for Obama.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.206 align:middle line:84%
And he says yeah,
and you wouldn't

00:30:34.206 --> 00:30:36.920 align:middle line:84%
believe the level of entrainment
it took to get me here.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.380 align:middle line:84%
He said he had the
entire stadium.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said well maybe
is it possible--

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.570 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want to believe
that Democrats were using it

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that much-- is it possible that
he's just that charismatic?

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:90%
And he said no effin way.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.890 align:middle line:90%
He said this is entrainment.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.230 align:middle line:84%
He said it's the
intermodulation,

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.550 align:middle line:84%
the level of sophistication
is like we've never

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:90%
seen anybody do it this well.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And we know it's not
Barack Obama doing this.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But it was who wanted him to
be elected who was doing it.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well and you can look
back at it and the forensics

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:09.960 align:middle line:90%
historically.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot happened
under his presidency.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Really we didn't our commitment
to the military industrial

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.345 align:middle line:90%
We didn't go after Wall Street.

00:31:19.345 --> 00:31:20.886 align:middle line:84%
We actually didn't
go after anything,

00:31:20.886 --> 00:31:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well there's so many
things that we could get into.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to
go into the politics,

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.500 align:middle line:84%
but the point is it
was business as usual.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.875 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: There is something
really important about what

00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:84%
you're saying,
because, basically, we

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:39.420 align:middle line:84%
have people who make rhetorical
impact without actions.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's Barack Obama.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:41.988 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That did
happen that way.

00:31:41.988 --> 00:31:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Barack Obama,
under his administration, Ken

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Salazar, as the Secretary
of the Interior,

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:50.130 align:middle line:84%
every talks about oh, we
don't want Sarah Palin.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:51.213 align:middle line:90%
We don't want Sarah Palin.

00:31:51.213 --> 00:31:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Look at what Ken Salazar did.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:57.270 align:middle line:84%
He issued more oil and
gas drilling leases

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:84%
than any other Secretary
of the Interior in history

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:04.710 align:middle line:84%
with fracking, which has
contaminated aquifers

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:05.980 align:middle line:90%
all over the country.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is about
this entrainment,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:84%
also, because people just rolled
with it because it was Obama.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.840 align:middle line:84%
A Republican could not
get a nuclear reactor

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.730 align:middle line:84%
built in this country
even after 9-1-1.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean even in that
swansong period of the Bush

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:28.470 align:middle line:84%
administration, they
could not get a reactor

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.330 align:middle line:90%
built in this country.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Barack Obama gets elected
as the Trojan horse

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.610 align:middle line:84%
of the nuclear industry with
an incredible entrainment

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.040 align:middle line:84%
orchestration going
on in the background.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's 33 that are
now licensed for building.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.036 align:middle line:84%
And there's seven
under construction.

00:32:43.036 --> 00:32:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And people don't even
know this has happened.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they don't.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fair to say, I
like that what is that called?

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Rhetorical, not
entrainment, rhetorical

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.600 align:middle line:90%
what did you call it?

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: It's
rhetoric without action.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.184 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rhetoric
without any action.

00:32:58.184 --> 00:32:59.849 align:middle line:84%
That's right, because
it didn't turn out

00:32:59.849 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:84%
to be change we
could believe in.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: People are
saying oh Barack was

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.780 align:middle line:84%
such a great president,
and the environment,

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.330 align:middle line:90%
and all of these things.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:10.982 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually look
at the impact, in reality.

00:33:10.982 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:84%
The number of people
who actually are out

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.565 align:middle line:84%
of work, the number of
people who have become

00:33:14.565 --> 00:33:15.790 align:middle line:90%
disenfranchised.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean completely
disenfranchised,

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:84%
like vacated from the
system, but they're not gone.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:21.510 align:middle line:90%
They're not dead.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
just not counted.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And,
then, on top of that,

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:84%
you add what's being
sprayed in the air,

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.924 align:middle line:84%
which is also coupled
with the entrainment.

00:33:28.924 --> 00:33:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
we're going next.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yes.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it wasn't intended
to make a political commentary

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.350 align:middle line:90%
about Barack Obama.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to lead into the
whole subject of entrainment

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and how it was discovered
in that campaign.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So we can only guess
how it was utilized

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:84%
in the campaign between Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I brought this
up is because people were not

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.170 align:middle line:90%
acting like themselves.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.440 align:middle line:84%
People were unfriending
people on Facebook

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.780 align:middle line:84%
throughout that campaign
that were formerly friends

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.510 align:middle line:84%
because just kind
of outrageously

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:05.325 align:middle line:84%
polarized viewpoints
that were developing.

00:34:05.325 --> 00:34:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Well, let's say
you're an enemy of the United

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.750 align:middle line:84%
States of America,
what better thing

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.145 align:middle line:84%
can you do than to cause
this deep psychic division

00:34:13.145 --> 00:34:13.945 align:middle line:90%
in the country?

00:34:13.945 --> 00:34:14.861 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It happened.

00:34:14.861 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And people getting
divorced, people committing

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.400 align:middle line:90%
homicide, for God's sakes.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:84%
And all of them--
and I don't just

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:84%
mean them, I'm conscious of it,
so I have found myself watching

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.690 align:middle line:84%
somebody on TV-- I've
watched Barack Obama on TV

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.389 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly thought, oh,
wow, I really like him.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do, too.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Everyone liked -- a lot
of people liked him.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: He's
hard not to like.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.090 align:middle line:90%
He's a very charismatic guy.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.090 align:middle line:84%
He's very intelligent,
all of that.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.389 align:middle line:84%
And we can blame him
and demonize him,

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:84%
which we do way too much
of-- with presidents,

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:51.949 align:middle line:84%
we put too much burden on the
Executive because basically

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and way too much power
is concentrated there.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.610 align:middle line:84%
It's really out of the
checks and balances range

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:57.510 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the
matter is somebody

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.240 align:middle line:90%
is pulling the strings.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.870 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things, an
interesting aside one day,

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:10.140 align:middle line:10%
relative to Bill Clinton--
because I was there

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:15.030 align:middle line:10%
at the inauguration and
there was this messianic aura

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.350 align:middle line:10%
of the whole thing.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:20.250 align:middle line:84%
But I was told six months
before the primaries

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.440 align:middle line:84%
that he was going to
be the next president

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and that Al Gore was going to be
the vice president, whether he

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.690 align:middle line:90%
liked it or not.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was like and that's
the way it played out.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So somebody-- and as
a scientist I abhor

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.650 align:middle line:90%
spookiness for no reason.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But when I've seen
it with my own eyes.

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And the laboratory
where we recorded

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.770 align:middle line:84%
the HAARP data, for example, got
raided by 13 federal marshals

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.330 align:middle line:84%
right after I wrote
an article, which

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.900 align:middle line:84%
was also pulled from the
web from my own website.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.630 align:middle line:84%
My own website was just
shut down completely,

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.450 align:middle line:84%
which was much easier to do
back then than it is now.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:03.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's happened since
then again a couple times.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:09.120 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is it
isn't just a one-sided thing.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So there are people who know
this can be used for good.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's people who know
it can be used for evil.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's just plain evil.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: It's just
plain evil and there's

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:23.200 align:middle line:90%
no two ways about it.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And the degree to
which people are

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:84%
willing to damage other
people for the sake

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:33.160 align:middle line:84%
of their political gain is
always just remarkable to me.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:40.120 align:middle line:84%
My god, it's like excuse me,
not only do we systematically

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.904 align:middle line:84%
under educate our
population, even in fact,

00:36:42.904 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:84%
compared to the
rest of the world,

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.440 align:middle line:84%
we're just falling further and
further and further behind.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller
said in 1969, 1970,

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.740 align:middle line:84%
that this was one of the
most insidious things

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.780 align:middle line:84%
that he could see that
was going to impact

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.790 align:middle line:84%
the future of the
United States of America

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and its security as much,
or more, than anything else,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.140 align:middle line:84%
because it was becoming
less and less informed

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.420 align:middle line:84%
democracy because of the
failure of the school systems

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:84%
back then, which looks stellar
compared to the school systems

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.830 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.720 align:middle line:90%
What the heck happened?

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the entrainment
that has grown hand in hand

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:16.960 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Right.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you have people
who entrained into dead ends

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and loops in their own brains
where things, patterns,

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.220 align:middle line:84%
are being repeated even
after the stimulation is

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:31.110 align:middle line:84%
gone that's usurping the
circuitry of their brains.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And I mean if I was
somebody listening to this

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:40.570 align:middle line:84%
and I was a skeptic, which
is not a bad thing to be,

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I would have many questions.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say that
I understand why people

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:48.550 align:middle line:90%
would have many questions.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to campaign
for that-- well,

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.300 align:middle line:84%
actually, in a certain
sense, I am here

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.060 align:middle line:90%
saying this is ridiculous.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And we need laws
that are up to date.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:05.500 align:middle line:84%
We need real monitoring by the
Department of Homeland Security

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.410 align:middle line:84%
so that we know that
we are not being

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.870 align:middle line:84%
subjected to this by
any corporation and/or

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.760 align:middle line:90%
by our own governments.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And not just in this country,
people in the European Union

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.665 align:middle line:84%
have found themselves
falling into lockstep.

00:38:17.665 --> 00:38:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
friends in Europe.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:25.744 align:middle line:84%
And this also is coupled with
the chemical attack aspect.

00:38:25.744 --> 00:38:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think most
people listening to this,

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:31.120 align:middle line:84%
or watching this right
now, talk about skeptics

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.990 align:middle line:84%
would be almost in
unison skeptical

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.170 align:middle line:84%
that the powers that
be would take it on

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.909 align:middle line:84%
to protect the citizens against
what we're being subjected to.

00:38:41.909 --> 00:38:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anyone
has faith that's

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:84%
going to happen on an
institutional level.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Which is
also because we have

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.720 align:middle line:90%
a very unstable magnetic field.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.330 align:middle line:84%
We have a huge amount of
stress and strain buildup

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.160 align:middle line:90%
in the crust of the earth.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't have time to
get into the models.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we
don't but, right.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.701 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: But the
fact of the matter

00:38:58.701 --> 00:39:00.550 align:middle line:84%
is there's huge
amount of heat that's

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.620 align:middle line:84%
built up under the crust
of the earth right now.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And the rock
glaciers are moving.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And the volcanoes are going
to go off more and more.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way to
reverse it for the next 200

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:16.120 align:middle line:84%
years short of really actually
putting like Russia and China

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and the United States working
together-- not just those three

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.030 align:middle line:84%
countries, but they happen to
have the greatest conservation

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.830 align:middle line:90%
resource.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Canada, Germany, huge resources
there in terms of intellect,

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:31.160 align:middle line:84%
huge resources, and
really sophistication,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.320 align:middle line:90%
a lot of sophistication.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to service
scientists in Europe

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.200 align:middle line:84%
for a long time about
this, and believe me,

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.986 align:middle line:84%
they're watching
on the one hand.

00:39:39.986 --> 00:39:41.860 align:middle line:84%
But they're still allowing
chemtrail spraying

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.860 align:middle line:84%
to go on there on the
other hand under the guise

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.865 align:middle line:84%
of geoengineering,
which it's not.

00:39:46.865 --> 00:39:47.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:47.665 --> 00:39:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But we talked about
another thing off camera

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:54.010 align:middle line:90%
and that was that Putin has--

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Putin's
banned chemtrails.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Putin's banned GMOs.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And Putin's banned
fluoride in the water.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: So the great
demon Vladimir Putin,

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:11.832 align:middle line:84%
from the Orwell-esque
projection side of things.

00:40:11.832 --> 00:40:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean you know if it
wasn't for the fact

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:16.790 align:middle line:84%
that he's still bombing Aleppo,
he might have more credibility.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:17.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Just sorry, I had to add that.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.589 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is of the matter
is he has at least stood up

00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and said you're not going
to do that in my skies,

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:27.550 align:middle line:84%
because we've
discovered lithium.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.910 align:middle line:84%
We've discovered
iridium-192 which

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:34.500 align:middle line:84%
is a hepatotoxic,
hepatocarcinogen,

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.570 align:middle line:84%
it causes liver
cancer, which we're all

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:38.740 align:middle line:90%
breathing all the time.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.780 align:middle line:84%
It's ubiquitous
everywhere I've gone.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've traveled a lot
with radiation meters,

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.305 align:middle line:90%
with spectrum analysis.

00:40:45.305 --> 00:40:46.804 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Iridium
is everywhere now?

00:40:46.804 --> 00:40:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And
iridium-192 is ubiquitous

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:52.180 align:middle line:84%
in the northern hemisphere
of this planet, at least,

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.242 align:middle line:84%
and anywhere chemtrail
spraying is going on.

00:40:54.242 --> 00:40:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But especially in the
northern hemisphere where

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.160 align:middle line:90%
it's been concentrated.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.535 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
whole other subject

00:40:58.535 --> 00:41:03.100 align:middle line:84%
why that's happening but to be
on the subject of manipulation

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:07.980 align:middle line:84%
of political will, probably the
most important component we see

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.670 align:middle line:90%
is lithium.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We know
what lithium does.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And then I shouldn't
say the most important,

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:19.330 align:middle line:84%
the most important component
is nano aluminum silicate.

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now most people
haven't heard of that.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: It's
basically just very, very

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.290 align:middle line:84%
small particles of
aluminum, bonded with quartz

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:32.904 align:middle line:84%
in like nano, like
billionths of a meter.

00:41:32.904 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does that work
on the immune system,

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:35.590 align:middle line:90%
the nervous system?

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.170 align:middle line:90%
What does it work on?

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:38.461 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: It gets absorbed
through the nasal passages,

00:41:38.461 --> 00:41:43.390 align:middle line:84%
goes directly in the frontal
lobes area of the brain.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.790 align:middle line:90%
It goes into the hippocampus.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:50.860 align:middle line:84%
It goes into-- and gets
absorbed by the neurons.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And then interrupts
the flow of current

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.230 align:middle line:84%
in those neurons in
such a way-- aluminum

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.590 align:middle line:84%
is the number one model we find
in autopsies of Alzheimer's

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:04.150 align:middle line:84%
dementia patients-- this
aluminum goes and causes

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:07.864 align:middle line:84%
rapid, rapid degradation, much
more rapid than we used to see.

00:42:07.864 --> 00:42:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Severe
dementia quickly.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Severe dementia
in 14 and 15-year-old kids

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.530 align:middle line:84%
who are dying of
Alzheimer's disease now.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.630 align:middle line:84%
This is being
sprayed in our skies.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And when confronted, somebody
from a local place here,

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.190 align:middle line:84%
when confronted
about geoengineering

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:27.730 align:middle line:84%
was quoted very recently
as saying that's

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:28.960 align:middle line:90%
out of my specialty.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.500 align:middle line:90%
That's beyond my specialization.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
physiological impacts are.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And the questioner,
who is a neurologist,

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:41.370 align:middle line:84%
neurophysiologist,
and he said well

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:44.170 align:middle line:84%
what do you mean you don't
know what the impact is?

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.210 align:middle line:84%
How could you spray
this in the skies

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:49.300 align:middle line:84%
of the world in a
coordinated effort

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.290 align:middle line:84%
through the United Nations,
who has superseding authority

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:56.230 align:middle line:84%
in this, how could you do that
to the population of Earth

00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:84%
if you know that it might
be causing and, in fact,

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I can confirm to you as a
neurophysiologist-- not me,

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.460 align:middle line:84%
but he was saying
this, Dr. Blalock--

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.020 align:middle line:84%
he said that this
is something that

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.890 align:middle line:90%
is happening to my patients.

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:10.690 align:middle line:90%
This is something--

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
Robert Blalock, right?

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.503 align:middle line:90%
He's wonderful.

00:43:12.503 --> 00:43:12.846 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yeah.

00:43:12.846 --> 00:43:13.646 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:13.646 --> 00:43:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: He's
really very brave man.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He is

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And it's
extremely important

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that scientists, male and
female, develop courage.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Because this is ridiculous,
this is extermination.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:90%
This is a global Auschwitz.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And that is really
what's happening.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like total
paranoid craziness to say that,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.210 align:middle line:84%
but, in point of
fact, it's happening.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.610 align:middle line:84%
When we see this
happening and we

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:45.270 align:middle line:84%
confront people about
it, various people.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I have conference call
after conference call,

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:48.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to people.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, OK, you guys
know about the nano aluminum

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:53.170 align:middle line:90%
silicate?

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a bunch of them
do, sometimes they don't.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I said do you realize
that at this level,

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:01.710 align:middle line:84%
not only does it
stay in suspension

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:05.590 align:middle line:84%
much longer than anybody
ever anticipated--

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.420 align:middle line:84%
they didn't really
do experiments first

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to see what the
hang time would be

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:13.400 align:middle line:84%
for these particles and the
slang term to apply to this--

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.400 align:middle line:84%
but the fact of the matter
is they didn't really

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.110 align:middle line:90%
do the homework.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:90%
They just started spraying it.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And they said well this will
really effectively reflect

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.390 align:middle line:84%
sunlight into space and that
will justify geoengineering.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:31.030 align:middle line:84%
But the lithium and the damage
between the lithium calming

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:32.730 align:middle line:90%
everybody down and making--

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And iridium.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And iridium
to absorb neutrons

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:39.880 align:middle line:84%
from the spontaneous
fissioning of isotopes

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.300 align:middle line:84%
from Fukushima that
are still circulating

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:46.520 align:middle line:84%
in the upper atmosphere
of the Earth to this day.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:84%
They're really
still circulating.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.210 align:middle line:84%
We have plutonium
fissioning and we

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.210 align:middle line:90%
have neutron storms happening.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:55.720 align:middle line:90%
We've measured neutron storms.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.665 align:middle line:84%
And Patrick Flanagan measured
a neutron storm in Costa Rica.

00:44:58.665 --> 00:45:00.790 align:middle line:84%
He called me up from Costa
Rica and he said my god,

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.420 align:middle line:84%
you're not to
believe I'm getting

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:06.190 align:middle line:90%
6,000 neutrons a second.

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm flying up over
the pole a couple of years

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:11.290 align:middle line:90%
ago going to lecture in Europe.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I was measuring going
up over the pole.

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
we're always used

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.440 align:middle line:90%
to seeing cosmogenic neutrons.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But I had spectrum
analyzer capabilities.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So I was seeing
plutonium-239, you know.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing cesium-137,
cesium-134, et cetera.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.440 align:middle line:90%
And I have the data.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And we were in a neutron
storm for four hours.

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And so having survived
cancer from exposure

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.480 align:middle line:84%
to radiation right
here in Boulder,

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.050 align:middle line:84%
right out in Broomfield
actually in a dairy farm

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:49.150 align:middle line:84%
next to Rocky Flats-- in
1974 is when I got exposed.

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:52.450 align:middle line:84%
10,000 times 80-- actually
the highest sample

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:56.260 align:middle line:84%
was 80,000 times permissible
levels of plutonium oxide

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that I had in a baggie
in my back pocket

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.440 align:middle line:90%
because it was number 10 bag.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It was my last bag.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:04.547 align:middle line:90%
So I have to say something now.

00:46:04.547 --> 00:46:06.755 align:middle line:84%
So you found your way back
to health, thank goodness.

00:46:06.755 --> 00:46:09.017 align:middle line:84%
And you've been monitoring
all this and go ahead.

00:46:09.017 --> 00:46:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And so I
have-- it's called

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.790 align:middle line:84%
enlightened
self-interest, but it's

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.500 align:middle line:90%
from real hard won experience.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I know what these
things actually do.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're all being
exposed to it.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:22.890 align:middle line:84%
The campaign is-- to me,
to tell you the truth,

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.830 align:middle line:84%
honestly-- the whole thing
is a bloody distraction

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:27.270 align:middle line:90%
from reality.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Because in point of fact,
what we have to demand,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and everybody has to demand
this all over the world,

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.900 align:middle line:84%
we have to demand that the
spraying of these chemicals

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.250 align:middle line:90%
stops now.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People have
tried repeatedly.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I started in on
this 16 years ago.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.980 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
everybody, taking pictures,

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.460 align:middle line:90%
calling every agency.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Dennis Kucinich.

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I was there when he announced
his candidacy in Marin County.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that came
up was that his ban on space

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:59.420 align:middle line:84%
based weapons agenda
that he was putting out.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.560 align:middle line:84%
He eliminated the chemtrail
portion of that legislation.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Someone in the crowd
was aware of this,

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:08.480 align:middle line:84%
stood up, and said why did
you bail on chemtrails?

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.845 align:middle line:84%
And he said because
if I continued,

00:47:10.845 --> 00:47:14.070 align:middle line:84%
it would take everything
else I'm trying to do down.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Next.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.230 align:middle line:90%
And he's a brave man.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Dennis was a brave man.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:21.497 align:middle line:84%
But even he wouldn't
even talk about it.

00:47:21.497 --> 00:47:22.580 align:middle line:90%
No one will talk about it.

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Nobody wants
to talk about it, I know.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:25.433 align:middle line:90%
Hardly anybody wants talk.

00:47:25.433 --> 00:47:28.022 align:middle line:84%
More people are talking
about, a lot more people.

00:47:28.022 --> 00:47:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well let's not
get into the politics of it.

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into
another area of it.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:32.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So we're being exposed
to all of this.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yes.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You notice that
some people are definitely

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:40.800 align:middle line:84%
more susceptible to developing
symptoms than other people.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Some people's brains
are super sensitive,

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:46.400 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they're getting
more saturated levels.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.830 align:middle line:84%
The point is what
can we do in terms

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:53.210 align:middle line:84%
of just the one thing
aluminum saturation

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:54.520 align:middle line:90%
in our frontal lobes?

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: You could
take magnesium malate.

00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I hope everybody's
writing these names down.

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Magnesium malate
is the most important thing

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:06.120 align:middle line:84%
to counteract the
impact of nano alum--

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it
chelate it or something?

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: It does.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.800 align:middle line:84%
The malic acid, the
most effective way

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:15.080 align:middle line:84%
to deliver the malic acid to
our systems and to our brains

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.500 align:middle line:90%
is married with magnesium.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So as it's coupled
with magnesium,

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:22.354 align:middle line:90%
it's delivered very effectively.

00:48:22.354 --> 00:48:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And you get the benefit of the
magnesium at the same time.

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Magnesium malate is
the ticket, because it

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:31.000 align:middle line:90%
will bond with the aluminum.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.500 align:middle line:84%
It will get it out
through the kidneys.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.540 align:middle line:90%
And we will eliminate it.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.450 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:37.520 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.540 align:middle line:90%
And I highly recommend it.

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:41.549 align:middle line:84%
Shilajit it is also
very important.

00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Shilajit, yeah.

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:44.140 align:middle line:90%
That's rising in popularity.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: The most
important thing

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that we've found so far
as a source of humic acid.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And humic acid is the
most effective chelator

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.910 align:middle line:90%
of radioisotopes.

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:56.710 --> 00:49:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So what do you guys take
in terms of the humic acid?

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Oh, it'd be like me
plugging a specific product.

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
want to do that.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.209 align:middle line:84%
But is there a range
of them or something?

00:49:07.209 --> 00:49:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Just go online and search
for really high quality

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:10.010 align:middle line:90%
humic acids?

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:11.468 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: There's
only one company

00:49:11.468 --> 00:49:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that we know of that actually
purifies their shilajit's such

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:19.100 align:middle line:84%
that they make sure that
there's no heavy metals in it.

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Because shilajit tends to have,
from some areas in particular,

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:24.500 align:middle line:84%
tends to have
heavy metals in it.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be
careful of that.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: S-H-I-L-O-G-E-T?

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: S-H-I-L-A-J-I-T.
That's just one way they also

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.634 align:middle line:90%
called it mumie.

00:49:36.634 --> 00:49:37.800 align:middle line:90%
They call it various things.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Like when you're in Afghanistan,
it's called one thing.

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.420 align:middle line:84%
When you're in
Nepal, it's called--

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but if we're
searching online in America,

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.500 align:middle line:90%
if we're googling it, shilajit.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Shilajit, yeah.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's the only
one that has been purified.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: There's
only one company

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:49.240 align:middle line:84%
that's doing that, that's
doing the chemo analysis.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
says that on that--

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And actually
every single batch

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.500 align:middle line:90%
has chemo analysis.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to say
it because it's pure black.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
go off the charts.

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter
is people need to know,

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.179 align:middle line:84%
how to get this stuff
out of our systems.

00:50:08.179 --> 00:50:09.011 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, we do.

00:50:09.011 --> 00:50:10.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's our job.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: We need to
know about nootropes.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.540 align:middle line:84%
We need to know about
all of this stuff.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.920 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the
matter is we also

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.660 align:middle line:84%
need to know about
how easy it is

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.140 align:middle line:90%
to counteract the entrainment.

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.481 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was coming to next.

00:50:21.481 --> 00:50:22.670 align:middle line:90%
This is for the body.

00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Get this junk out of
our brains and bodies.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yes.

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have a
couple great suggestions.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate your
revealing the name as well.

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Sure.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:32.368 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then now,
let's look at Hemi-Sync

00:50:32.368 --> 00:50:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and other means by which
we can start taking

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:35.790 align:middle line:90%
our own entrainment back.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Right.

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.057 align:middle line:90%
And meditation.

00:50:38.057 --> 00:50:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, meditation.

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Meditation is
an essential foundation.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Basic breath.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.480 align:middle line:84%
People are never
taught to breathe.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that
harmonizes the hemispheres

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:49.620 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And
kids, for example--

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I know this from
personal experience

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.853 align:middle line:84%
because we had our own schools
out in California that we

00:50:54.853 --> 00:50:57.350 align:middle line:84%
created-- and the very
first thing that kids

00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:01.630 align:middle line:84%
learned how to do was to breathe
and to feel with their breath.

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's an
incredibly empowering

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:07.480 align:middle line:84%
to do that from the
time that a child begins

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to become articulate and to
incorporate that into instead

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.370 align:middle line:84%
of behavior
modification and do this

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:17.925 align:middle line:84%
and don't do this,
stop and breathe.

00:51:17.925 --> 00:51:18.800 align:middle line:90%
What are you feeling?

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Are you feeling good?

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Are you feeling happy?

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to feel this way?

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Feel, what are you feeling?

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Ask anybody.

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Any of us, it's not like
any of us are immune.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm certainly not
claiming immunity.

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I have to stop
and breathe a lot.

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And who doesn't?

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:40.630 align:middle line:84%
If you know how to
do it, you do it.

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So the very first
thing anybody can do,

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:46.750 align:middle line:84%
without spending a dime, is to
learn how to stop and breathe

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:48.340 align:middle line:90%
and to feel.

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling literally
causes the electrical current

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:53.860 align:middle line:84%
to branch out through
our nervous systems,

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.710 align:middle line:84%
through our cellular structure
in such a way that it

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:58.570 align:middle line:90%
helps counteract all of this.

00:51:58.570 --> 00:51:59.950 align:middle line:90%
And we can stay awake.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:02.455 align:middle line:84%
But first, we have to understand
that we're being impacted.

00:52:02.455 --> 00:52:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: So
understanding that we're

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.714 align:middle line:84%
being impacted doesn't mean that
we curl up in a corner and go,

00:52:06.714 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:84%
oh, no, they are doing
this to me again.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.330 align:middle line:90%
They're doing it to everybody.

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:11.756 align:middle line:90%
It's not just one person.

00:52:11.756 --> 00:52:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So the paranoid schizophrenic's
can put it away and get over it

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.970 align:middle line:90%
and start breathing.

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Seriously And so
everybody can do that.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can start
drinking good water.

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And people say don't
drink reverse osmosis

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:26.200 align:middle line:90%
water it's dead.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, well you can reverse
osmos your water,

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.450 align:middle line:84%
which everybody should be
doing to get all of this stuff

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:33.160 align:middle line:90%
that you can get out out.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, add magnesium
and calcium back in.

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can put it through
something that energizes it,

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.620 align:middle line:90%
makes it alkaline.

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.420 align:middle line:84%
It's worth the
investment because it

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.840 align:middle line:84%
will save you in terms of
the health of your family.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.840 align:middle line:84%
This is something
everybody can do,

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.250 align:middle line:84%
almost everybody can do
this I mean there are people

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:56.290 align:middle line:84%
out there in the rural areas,
I'm sure, who would say,

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:59.030 align:middle line:84%
well, we just don't have
the money to do that.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Well do you have the
money for your kids

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:03.880 align:middle line:90%
to be sick chronically?

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.270 align:middle line:84%
What is it worth to you to be
able to remember why you just

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:09.430 align:middle line:90%
went to the store?

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And how many
millions of Americans

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:13.930 align:middle line:84%
get to the store, who are
in their 30s and 40s now

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hearing this from all
over the country and the world,

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:19.980 align:middle line:90%
people having these fuse.

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:21.530 align:middle line:84%
It used to be called
senior moments.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:24.370 align:middle line:84%
But what do you call it
when it's a 21-year-old kid

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:26.271 align:middle line:90%
or a 18-year-old kid?

00:53:26.271 --> 00:53:27.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't call that
a senior moment,

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:30.400 align:middle line:84%
you call that dementia
that's being induced.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So we need to take
responsibility.

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.220 align:middle line:84%
You and I and everybody
in the entire world

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.310 align:middle line:84%
needs to take responsibility
for ourselves.

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you say, OK,
you can't do this to me.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.960 align:middle line:84%
You may have your
[? femtocell ? ] signals,

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.850 align:middle line:84%
you may have your
chemtrails spraying,

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:47.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take malate.

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
the isotopes out

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:51.280 align:middle line:84%
of my system that have been
streaming from Fukushima

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.340 align:middle line:84%
in spite of the fact that the US
government has been denying it.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.672 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do whatever
I have-- not just the US

00:53:56.672 --> 00:53:57.630 align:middle line:90%
government, by the way.

00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Basically, and
Hemi-Sync, there's

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:02.440 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of things
you can buy online.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.910 align:middle line:90%
They're actually quite good.

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I went to sleep last night
using a brainwave program that I

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:09.370 align:middle line:90%
downloaded it onto my iPad.

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And anytime I'm on
the road, I play this

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and I can tune it
for lucid dreaming.

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.252 align:middle line:90%
I can tune it for deep sleep.

00:54:17.252 --> 00:54:18.460 align:middle line:90%
I can tune it any way I want.

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's the company?

00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Just
Google brainwave.

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Or go to the app store
and go brainwave.

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see a whole
thing that will come up.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.455 align:middle line:84%
Now I have another
question, so--

00:54:27.455 --> 00:54:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: There's
not just one company.

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But I mean this
particular company

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.830 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of things
that are binaural.

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:34.450 align:middle line:90%
They're very good.

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:35.440 align:middle line:90%
They work.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Good so we can do that.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.885 align:middle line:90%
We have it in our pocket.

00:54:37.885 --> 00:54:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, ideally not in our
pocket, but we have it somewhere

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:43.360 align:middle line:90%
near us on our iPhones.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: And also HeartMath.

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:46.043 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And HeartMath as well.

00:54:46.043 --> 00:54:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: HeartMath is
really very powerful.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:49.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's very simple.

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:51.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's an amazing thing.

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I hope
to do with my grandchildren

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.920 align:middle line:84%
is to work with them and help
them learn how to do HeartMath,

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.660 align:middle line:90%
because what a great thing.

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:01.334 align:middle line:84%
Imagine having
HeartMath competitions.

00:55:01.334 --> 00:55:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very smart.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Where kids
learn how to cohere.

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And, man, I'll tell you
in my own experience

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:11.320 align:middle line:84%
when I first started
waking up in my teens.

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It was like I was very mental.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:19.530 align:middle line:90%
I was seriously mental.

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:21.676 align:middle line:90%
I was mental.

00:55:21.676 --> 00:55:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the fact of the matter
is that it's the breath.

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:31.720 align:middle line:84%
The [INAUDIBLE] in the
most esoteric Buddhism.

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Even in esoteric
Judaism, which we

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.210 align:middle line:84%
have a great example
of in Jesus Christ,

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.930 align:middle line:84%
for example, which we tend
to forget that he was Jewish.

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But in point of fact the ruach
hakodesh, the holy breath,

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:47.650 align:middle line:90%
is the root of everything.

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So the breath, again
and again, people

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:52.090 align:middle line:90%
say it can't be that simple.

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:56.770 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be able
to oxygenate ourselves.

00:55:56.770 --> 00:56:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Also we need to take care
of ionic environments, too.

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.190 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
things that we can do.

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that we can do
right now is breathe always.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we can buy
whatever we afford to buy.

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Magnesium malate, MegaHydrate.

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.061 align:middle line:90%
MegaHydrate's important.

00:56:18.061 --> 00:56:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: MegaHydrate's
Patrick's product.

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:20.515 align:middle line:90%
Yes, OK.

00:56:20.515 --> 00:56:21.973 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: It's
extremely important

00:56:21.973 --> 00:56:24.880 align:middle line:84%
because it is negatively
ionized hydrogen. He found a way

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.440 align:middle line:90%
to deliver this to our system.

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one charge
carrier in the body.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And you know your cells will
no longer stack and stick

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:34.600 align:middle line:90%
together, if you're taking it.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And you will eliminate
toxins like you didn't even

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:37.940 align:middle line:90%
know you could.

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I basically, from the
time I started doing it

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:44.090 align:middle line:84%
in 1999, three years
later, I finally

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:46.820 align:middle line:84%
got through with
detoxing from cancer.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.420 align:middle line:90%
So those are--

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: I thought.

00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody infected
me with something else,

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:58.410 align:middle line:90%
another form a virus of cancer.

00:56:58.410 --> 00:56:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunate.

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Unfortunate But you
see, the point is that I'm here

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.000 align:middle line:90%
laughing about it.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah and you
detoxed from it and so again--

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: That great
song "I'm Here."

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:06.030 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're here.

00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:07.810 align:middle line:90%
And MegaHydrate's here.

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:10.330 align:middle line:84%
We know Patrick's product has
been out there for many years.

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And I don't
mind plugging MegaHydrate

00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:14.390 align:middle line:84%
because I've turned
so many people onto it

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:15.190 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:18.080 align:middle line:90%
And it has saved so many people.

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.140 align:middle line:90%
We are all toxic.

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:21.480 align:middle line:90%
We are all cranky.

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.350 align:middle line:90%
We are all forlorn.

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:26.660 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of people who
are like wondering whether they

00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:28.370 align:middle line:90%
should even be alive next week.

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:30.490 align:middle line:84%
They think that Donald
Trump is the worst

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:32.000 align:middle line:90%
thing that ever happened.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:32.980 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.480 align:middle line:84%
The worst thing
that ever happens

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.970 align:middle line:84%
is to presume that it's the
worst thing that ever happened.

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:37.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is correct.

00:57:37.425 --> 00:57:38.716 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree with you more.

00:57:38.716 --> 00:57:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: The worst thing that
happens is when people give up.

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have to give up.

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:45.317 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even
know who this guy is.

00:57:45.317 --> 00:57:47.900 align:middle line:84%
He was a Democrat before he ran
for president for God's sakes.

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:50.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
who Donald Trump is.

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.140 align:middle line:84%
We only know that
somebody decided that he

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.370 align:middle line:90%
was going to be president.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:59.317 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't the it wasn't
the majority of Americans.

00:57:59.317 --> 00:58:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do know that.

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.350 align:middle line:90%
Also something else.

00:58:01.350 --> 00:58:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you look at it from
an astrological point of view,

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and other points of
view, we are in a time

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.660 align:middle line:84%
that is requiring and
demanding a change.

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.200 align:middle line:84%
A change in our
thinking, a change

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.500 align:middle line:84%
in all institutional
thinking, systems

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:19.970 align:middle line:84%
need to start folding up shop so
new ones can be given birth to.

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And we needed to have an event
that would trigger change.

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't
learn the easy way.

00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:26.240 align:middle line:90%
We learn the hard way.

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And in
a certain sense,

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.040 align:middle line:84%
having Donald Trump
be elected president

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.540 align:middle line:84%
was a slap in the
face, which says

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to the progressive democratic
so-called movement-- which

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.850 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been moving
for a long time,

00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:40.580 align:middle line:84%
it's been stagnant-- is
that you've been stagnant.

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.872 align:middle line:84%
You haven't really taken
care of the environment.

00:58:42.872 --> 00:58:44.580 align:middle line:84%
You haven't really
taken care of nuclear.

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:46.040 align:middle line:90%
You've proliferated nuclear.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.430 align:middle line:84%
You haven't really
done your job.

00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:50.414 align:middle line:84%
And so you didn't
really represent.

00:58:50.414 --> 00:58:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Hillary
Clinton was saying

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:54.030 align:middle line:90%
GMO was getting a bad rap.

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:54.830 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So she could get
money from Monsanto?

00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:00.010 align:middle line:90%
I was very disappointed in that.

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that God bless
her and Bill and everything,

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.690 align:middle line:90%
but really?

00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So maybe some
miracle will happen.

00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe Donald Trump will
turn out to be somebody

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:14.370 align:middle line:84%
who actually once he's read
into what's really happening

00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:19.060 align:middle line:84%
will go, oh my god, it's
worse than I ever thought.

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wouldn't mind if
he took the cues from Putin

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:25.850 align:middle line:84%
at least on chemtrails,
GMOs, and fluoride.

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I think we'd all
appreciate that part of it.

00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:30.910 align:middle line:90%
But the reality is the gig's up.

00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:32.810 align:middle line:84%
As you say, the
earth is becoming--

00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:36.620 align:middle line:84%
the crust itself is becoming
unstable and heated.

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:37.700 align:middle line:90%
And so are we.

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.640 align:middle line:84%
All of this is being
transferred into us.

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Right.

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.140 align:middle line:84%
We suffer fight
or flight, sorry.

00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.440 align:middle line:90%
We should be upset.

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.060 align:middle line:90%
We should be demanding change.

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:47.560 align:middle line:84%
But it has to start
with ourselves.

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: That's right.

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that we
discovered in the early days,

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:55.060 align:middle line:84%
right after Elizabeth
Rauscher and Bill van Bise

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:56.810 align:middle line:84%
turned me on to
what they were doing

00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:59.440 align:middle line:84%
in the very early days of
forecasting earthquakes,

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and also in
monitoring ELF signals

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.830 align:middle line:84%
with these really simple
little spectrum analyzers

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:09.080 align:middle line:84%
we had back then,
as time went on,

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.490 align:middle line:84%
we would see that before
an earthquake people panic.

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:14.170 align:middle line:90%
They have fight or flight.

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we have
this instinctively.

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So we know, OK, we know
ahead of time enough

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.030 align:middle line:84%
usually that in the old days, a
sizable part of the population

01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:24.830 align:middle line:90%
would just move.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.413 align:middle line:84%
OK, it doesn't feel
good here anymore.

01:00:26.413 --> 01:00:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And people relied
on their feelings

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
because they were
living in nature.

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.100 align:middle line:90%
So they had to.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
intelligence that we've lost.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And we don't measure that in
the IQ tests, unfortunately.

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:41.060 align:middle line:90%
But it's extremely important.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And we would find
homicide levels going up.

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:52.510 align:middle line:84%
We would find heart attacks,
premature delivery of children.

01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
There was just lined up
all these stress factors

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.925 align:middle line:84%
before an earthquake
or an eruption.

01:00:59.925 --> 01:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, before Mount St.
Helens, very similar stuff

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.520 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Not just in Oregon,
because this is transmitted

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
through the ionospheric,
lithospheric waveguide of Earth

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and it goes far afield
from just the primary site.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And the problem now is like when
Elizabeth, and Bill, and I were

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
sitting in Emeryville in
their trailer there looking

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.670 align:middle line:84%
at this little
screen that they had,

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:27.520 align:middle line:84%
this electrosonic,
little spectrum analyzer,

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.915 align:middle line:90%
or electroscopics, anyway.

01:01:28.915 --> 01:01:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking
at this thing

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and there were like a
couple of spikes standing up

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:37.390 align:middle line:84%
in the background of the noise
of the extremely low frequency

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:40.850 align:middle line:84%
magnetic electromagnetic
field of the Earth.

01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And now, when you look
at a similar instrument,

01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:48.850 align:middle line:84%
the entire screen is
filled with indications.

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those spikes
indicate stress and strain

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
at an acute level at
a location on Earth.

01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Now the whole Earth, more and
more of the Earth, has this.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So people are
feeling disquieted.

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:03.800 align:middle line:84%
People are suddenly
feeling, out of nowhere,

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.920 align:middle line:84%
they're feeling like
completely anxious.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And they look at
their spouse and it's

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.370 align:middle line:90%
the only person that's close.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And so they immediately,
without even knowing why

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
it's happening-- I don't even
know why I'm arguing-- people--

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's millions
of people who say--

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know there are.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: And so
having these insights

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
can also be important
because people don't even

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.100 align:middle line:90%
know why they're fighting wars.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Because they're being
manipulated into fighting wars.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.900 align:middle line:90%
This is a business.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.430 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge
business, going back

01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to the industrialization of
warfare in the 19th century.

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge business.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And there are people,
there are really

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
people who are that parasitic,
and really, ultimately,

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.260 align:middle line:90%
that stupid.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, it's
just stupid to do this.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not a smart thing to do,
because, in point of fact,

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:56.160 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I said I know a number of
people who are billionaires.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And all I can say is
this, I say your money

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.520 align:middle line:84%
isn't worth anything in a world
that is totally destabilized.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you think you're
going to go live on Mars

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and be happy, good luck.

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Have fun there.

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Meanwhile.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.727 align:middle line:84%
So just in summary, because
we are well out of time.

01:03:16.727 --> 01:03:17.526 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Sure.

01:03:17.526 --> 01:03:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just
in summary, we're

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
living on a planet that's going
through its own process that

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.070 align:middle line:90%
is unstable.

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TROMBLY: Yes.

01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're living
in an environment

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:26.666 align:middle line:84%
where these people
you talk about,

01:03:26.666 --> 01:03:29.660 align:middle line:84%
megalomaniacs of whatever kind,
are projecting all of this

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.870 align:middle line:90%
onto us for their own means.

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:33.669 align:middle line:84%
We're also dealing
with chemtrails.

01:03:33.669 --> 01:03:34.960 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with all of this.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But all we have to
do is make the choice

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:41.000 align:middle line:90%
to stay stable amidst it.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Start with breath,
meditation-- which we all

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
have control over-- and
then a few key products,

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
which we've just mentioned,
to start bringing our physical

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.180 align:middle line:84%
either chelating or bringing
us back into harmony, right?

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
A little Hemi-Sync
thrown on top, maybe

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:57.431 align:middle line:84%
some beautiful music, laughter,
dancing, love, friendship.

01:03:57.431 --> 01:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: Global
meditation events.

01:03:58.930 --> 01:03:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:00.520 align:middle line:90%
And global meditation events.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TROMBLY: They're
already happening

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:03.850 align:middle line:84%
where tens of millions of
people are participating.

01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And people may think that
this is a silly thing,

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
but we are seated all
of us in the midst

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
of this boundless field
with illimitable energy

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
that we can connect directly
to no matter what our belief

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:17.660 align:middle line:90%
system is.

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.180 align:middle line:10%
If we get over our
belief systems,

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.910 align:middle line:10%
we can feel it, more
readily sometimes,

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:24.890 align:middle line:10%
because we know it's
infinitely present everywhere.

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:29.150 align:middle line:10%
And if we can do that, wow,
we could change the world even

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.950 align:middle line:10%
now.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:33.100 align:middle line:10%
But we have to do it.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nothing more to say
than that, we have to do it.

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Adam, thank you so much.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:38.486 align:middle line:84%
I know we could go on
for another three, four,

01:04:38.486 --> 01:04:41.470 align:middle line:90%
five hours.

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, so much.

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.100 align:middle line:90%
