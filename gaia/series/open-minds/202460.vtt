00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: It's
the dance of energy

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.550 align:middle line:10%
between the environment, our
bodies, our minds, past lives,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:10%
chakras, and our
auras that determines

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:10%
the quality of our lives.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:84%
If we continue to address only
one aspect of an intolerance

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.810 align:middle line:84%
or imbalance, we do so at the
expense of our total health

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and well-being.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Cyndi Dale, known to most
of us for her research

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and her publications
in the field of chakras

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
now expands that
story in her new book

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
called "Energy Healing," which
kind of brings it all together,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.260 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:84%
CYNDI DALE: It does, especially
that we're in a traumatic time.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.030 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: We certainly are.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
dive right into that

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and then kind of
back into our story.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, I just want
to say how much I appreciate

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you do
such incredible research

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:90%
and due diligence.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really
approach your subject

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
in about as academic a way as
you can without losing people

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
where they can't hang
in there with you.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's hard work, and I
really have a lot of respect

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:90%
for what you do.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Thank you.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:90%
It is hard work.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:10%
DALE: But we're
scientific creatures.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:10%
We have done a lot of
research to figure out,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:10%
at least to some level,
how the universe functions,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:10%
how the body functions,
how the mind functions.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we need to
tap into all sides of energy,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
not just the subtle, not
just the woo-woo, not just

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
the chakras that are still a
little bit difficult to prove

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.983 align:middle line:90%
the terms of their existence.

00:01:41.983 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
things we know,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:90%
so why not draw on that too?

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.215 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get to that in a bit

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
because in your chakra
system, it's 1 through 12, OK,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and in the auric system, in the
rings and fields of the aura,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:90%
1 through 12.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
surprising things

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:90%
in that part of your story.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.672 align:middle line:84%
I like the eighth one, the
eighth ring in the aura.

00:01:58.672 --> 00:01:59.880 align:middle line:90%
DALE: I love the eighth ring.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.010 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, we're
going to talk about that.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:90%
DALE: We'll just go there.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a fun one.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.373 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: We will talk about that.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, let's
talk about the fact--

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
because you mentioned
this in your work--

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:84%
that it appears that humanity
seems to still learn best

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
through trauma, and we're in
a state of great, great trauma

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.000 align:middle line:90%
on so many levels right now.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Your take on it.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:90%
DALE: I know.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:90%
It's sad.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I feel sad about it.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I see this sometimes
with individual clients,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that they need to keep
learning through trauma,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and hardship, and trying the
same thing over and over.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And we all have that penchant,
but humanity as a whole--

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
think about how many eras
we've existed on this planet--

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and they've all ended in
destruction-- and how many

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:84%
beautiful cultures
seem to get wiped away,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and art forms get destroyed.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So we do mainly
learn through trauma.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we need to.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to take
a stand individually

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and, in whatever culture we live
in, to say, no, it's enough.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.912 align:middle line:90%
And to me, that's on us.

00:03:00.912 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And the only way, I think,
we're going to get there--

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:84%
so an individual
voice can say no--

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
is to know it's on us, as
individuals, to say, no more.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn through grace.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:90%
I want to give grace.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to do something
that's about love in motion.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, too, the only
way we're going to get there

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:84%
is to say, OK, if it's on me,
Cyndi, then it has to be in me

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Absolutely, because
this is a maturity issue.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
As a species, we have
not matured to the extent

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
where we can honestly
evaluate ourselves

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on around
us and our interface with us,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes, not take the
responsibility needed to be

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.315 align:middle line:90%
able to have a higher outcome.

00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
requires a little work

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.273 align:middle line:90%
and a little discipline to boot.

00:03:45.273 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And we're not really down with
that, as a species, per se,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:90%
which is really--

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:90%
you're right-- it's all on us.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to
me, we're being

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.890 align:middle line:84%
given an amazing
opportunity now to mature.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:90%
DALE: We are.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And are we going to
as an individual?

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:90%
If it's on us, it's in us.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I just like that phrase.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.500 align:middle line:84%
DALE: It means I've set
myself up for this experience.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:84%
DALE: I don't believe we
cause everything in our world.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not responsible
for what everybody else does,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:84%
but I am responsible
for what I do.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
DALE: And every city
is responsible for what

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:84%
it's doing, the decisions
it's making, every country.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:84%
DALE: Each person--
well and we probably

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:84%
don't need each
person, to be honest.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Most of us know the story
of the hundredth monkey,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that when you get to a certain
percentage, things flash.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.420 align:middle line:90%
They get to change.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.327 align:middle line:84%
But I want to be
part of the change.

00:04:34.327 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to help other people
be part of the change.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's not about what we say.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:90%
We can say anything we want.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:90%
We can meditate.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:90%
We can pray.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
You can do whatever
you want, but it's

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
what energy you're sending
out and what you're actually

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:90%
accomplishing with it.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:84%
How aligned are you
with what you think?

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And I just see it as
an amazing opportunity

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
to rethink, slow down,
rethink for a minute,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and then reapply ourselves in
a good direction for ourselves,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:90%
and ideally, even for others.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're on the
same page on that.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've had
that kind of conversation

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
about our thinking
en masse as humanity,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.905 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start drilling
down a bit into the subject

00:05:16.905 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
that you talk about
in your book, which

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:84%
has to do with unhealed
trauma, but also,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.420 align:middle line:84%
the rise in abuse,
and in suicide,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:84%
drug use, alcoholism-- a lot
of trauma being inflicted right

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:90%
now, some of it self-inflicted.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is where you come
in and your work comes in.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So you notice that
a lot of people

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
come to you with unhealed
trauma to begin with,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and this starts, essentially,
inspiring chronic illness

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.210 align:middle line:90%
in their bodies.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Where do you even start
pulling the thread?

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:84%
As multi-dimensional creatures,
like I said, in the open,

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:90%
all these things matter.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Someone comes into you.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Say, they have-- oh, I have
chronic, horrible digestion

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It's gone on for years.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Where do you even start?

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:90%
DALE: That's a great question.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So there are current traumas,
as you're pointing out.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
are reacting because

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening right now.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't sound
very polite to say,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:84%
but that's easier to deal with,
that if they're triggering

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:84%
old trauma because maybe it's
just stop eating the Twinkies,

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
or take your digestive
enzymes, or turn off the news,

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:90%
or take a walk.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:90%
You can take a walk.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Get a dog, and it's going
to make you take walks.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So I like to start
simplistically.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So if we can do
something simple,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.270 align:middle line:84%
something here something
now-- get on the phone,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:84%
learn how to use Zoom,
learn how to text, whatever

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:90%
it is, let's start there.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But you know, 99% of the
time, that's not what it is.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It's not.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.245 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: We're going to go for
the deeper one, long-term,

00:06:48.245 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:90%
chronic.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
DALE: We got to go
for the deeper stuff.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So then we have to find what
I call the "causal issue."

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Like, what's the root
of today's symptoms?

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.330 align:middle line:90%
When are they?

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And again, I like to just
go backward in time slowly.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Is it from your adulthood?

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Is it childhood?

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Is it the womb?

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:90%
And those go farther back.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Is it past life?

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But we also have to splinter
off sometimes and go,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:90%
is it in your ancestry?

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we have 14
generations, at least,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
of our ancestors' memories
in our epigenetics.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So I'm glad we talked
about that because we're

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:84%
talking about this mind, spirit,
physical matrix, including

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.350 align:middle line:84%
the chakra system,
which we're going

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:90%
to get into in a little bit.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you start unwinding it,
you're going all the way back.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
You go all the way back
into the ancestral part.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:38.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So why do we keep attracting
the same kind of trauma

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.080 align:middle line:84%
over and over, even though,
now, someone's come to you--

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and you kind of work
your way through this,

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and then they call
you up a year later,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
eh, eh, it's happening
again, or yeah, I

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:84%
ended up in the exact same
kind of relationship again.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So what is it, looking
at us from a more--

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
almost a mechanical
model, in a sense--

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.022 align:middle line:84%
that keeps drawing back
the same circumstance

00:08:04.022 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:90%
and energetic patterns?

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Negative trances.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:90%
We're cavemen.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Think about caveman--
cavewomen, cavemen--

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:84%
let's be gender-neutral,
whatever we want to be.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
You're not so scared of
the gentle spring rain.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:84%
You're scared of
the lightning storm.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
You're not scared
of the pussycats.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You're scared of this
saber-toothed tiger.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So our energetic system
and our biology--

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:84%
our vagus nerve, our
microbiome, our chakras, which

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:90%
are subtle energy centers--

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:90%
we can't live our purpose.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.843 align:middle line:90%
If we don't stay alive.

00:08:36.843 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't get to
our spiritual purpose.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:90%
We can't get to the happy stuff.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We can't get to the, I'm a
healer, I'm helping people,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do this, I'm going
to do that if we're not still

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:90%
alive.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So we have to keep
the body alive.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So almost everything
for thousands of years

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
has been programmed into us
genetically, epigenetically,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
even into our chakras, the outer
wheel of our energy centers

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:90%
to stay.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:90%
First, live.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
living, survival means fit

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.100 align:middle line:84%
with the clan, don't be
weird, don't stand out,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:90%
don't be the voice saying--

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:84%
we can do this in
a peaceful place--

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.150 align:middle line:90%
get stoned, right?

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Or if you do the
right thing, you

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
don't believe you're
going to survive.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:90%
It's all programming.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:90%
I think it takes a long time--

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still working
on it to figure out--

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:84%
there's a different
programming inside of us.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a spiritual
programming, there's

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:84%
a dharmic programming that's
about goodness, that's

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:84%
about love, that's about all
these things that we need

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:90%
to make real, not conceptual.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:84%
But so far, we're
raised in families--

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:90%
97% are dysfunctional.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:90%
I learned that 30 years ago.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: True.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:84%
DALE: I think it's
more than true.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And we just go, you know what--
if I'm going to get to 18,

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.527 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to go
with the negative.

00:09:53.527 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do whatever
it's going to take.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.570 align:middle line:90%
And then we don't change at 18.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:90%
We just keep going.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So what you give off is
what you draw to you.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Most of what we give off--

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
99.99%-- of all
energy is subtle.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:90%
It's invisible.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And most of that is negative,
just like most of our thoughts

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:90%
are negative.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
we're thinking.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just happening
inside of us,

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's not going to change
until we decide to figure out

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
how to change it,
which we can do,

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:90%
but we have to figure out how.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Hints?

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:90%
DALE: I know.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: People are going to
be saying, wait a minute.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:84%
You're just leaving
us hanging on that?

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:90%
DALE: I know.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.467 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
leave us hanging.

00:10:30.467 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I love
working with chakras.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I know that most of my
family thinks I'm bizarre.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
They tease me now
that I like chakras.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Like, I sat at a family function
not too long ago, and my uncle,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:84%
who was drinking-- and he's
super funny when he drinks--

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.370 align:middle line:84%
he was like, you know, there's
a pyramid out in North Dakota.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
You should come out there and
just bring the aliens on down.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.270 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't being mean.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:84%
He was like, you're just
an oddball, but I like you.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just say something
odd that probably makes sense

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:90%
I like chakras because--

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:90%
this is the geeky chakra me--

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:84%
there's two wheels
to every chakra.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.020 align:middle line:84%
There's an outer wheel--
we got tons of chakras.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't care how many people--

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:90%
you can work with one.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't make any
difference to me.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
The outer wheel
holds the survival.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.210 align:middle line:90%
It holds the programs.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.300 align:middle line:84%
It holds the, I'm going to
get you before you get me.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:84%
It holds, I'm going to do
my fifth alcoholic husband.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It holds, this is
what's comfortable.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to fit in.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You know what-- there's an
inner wheel to every chakra.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
It has this sort of
beautiful absolute light.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.098 align:middle line:90%
It's a real light, science says.

00:11:38.098 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I like to quote science
because otherwise, people

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:90%
think I make it all up.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
DALE: So there's an
absolute line in there

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that holds positive
programs where love wins.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:53.403 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, all we really need
to do is go, I have it inside.

00:11:53.403 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to breathe inside.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use what that
Cyndi Dale woman said.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to imagine I
have these energy centers,

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to breathe into
the middle of my heart,

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to feel
what's good, I'm

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
going to give permission
for it to grow.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:90%
It'll push out the negative.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:84%
It'll push it out because
it's inside of us.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
about meditating.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:84%
You kind of need
to know what you're

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:84%
doing when you're
meditating if you

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.753 align:middle line:84%
want to grow this sort of
beautiful process for yourself.

00:12:22.753 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That's lovely.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.503 align:middle line:84%
It's very simple and
very direct because you

00:12:25.503 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:84%
don't have to really buy
into too much of anything.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:84%
You just say, OK, even if
I just have one big one.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:84%
DALE: You don't have to be
religious or not religious.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.960 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It's right here.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:90%
It's in the heart.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.646 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Easy.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Easy.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And that
one alone starts

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:84%
shifting the frequencies of your
thoughts and your physiology

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It does.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.390 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.973 align:middle line:84%
DALE: Well, if you
look back at time--

00:12:40.973 --> 00:12:42.750 align:middle line:90%
I look back at my life--

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:90%
everything big was simple.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.190 align:middle line:84%
It's when I finally decided,
OK, I'm not going to eat wheat,

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
or I really am going to
meditate from my heart

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and share this
light, or I really

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
am going to stay away and
not marry an alcoholic again.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:90%
It comes down to simple.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
contort ourselves.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:90%
We just don't.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of fun to
do that sometimes

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
because we can feel
powerful the more we do.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's simple.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Bring good energy up
through your feet.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:90%
The Earth holds good energy.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:84%
DALE: The stars
hold good energy.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Picture it, feel it,
think it, bring it up.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Feel it in the body.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.290 align:middle line:84%
There's heavenly
energy up there.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:84%
There's beautiful
energy up there.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you
call it "magnetics."

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you
call it the "sun god."

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you call
it "streams of grace,"

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:90%
which I like to call it.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Just image it, make it gold.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:90%
That works.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Make it pink.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Bring it into the body, and
feel it, and you can use it.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.812 align:middle line:90%
We kind of have to feel it.

00:13:46.812 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That's the big thing.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:90%
It can't just be conceptual.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that with
all of the various schools

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:84%
of new thought, in
the end, it always

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.380 align:middle line:84%
came down to this one,
oftentime, missing ingredient

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:90%
or missing step.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was down to
not just seeing it,

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
but you have to be able to
feel that moving through you.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And just the difference
between feelings and emotions

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
can oftentimes
trip people up too.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Exactly.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, it's not
just about feeling sad.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
If you do feel sad,
cry, and get on with it.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And move it to a
healthier place,

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:84%
because I believe every
feeling has a message,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and if you follow
it, it'll get you

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:84%
to a place of some form
of joy, maybe just relief,

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:90%
like thank God that's over.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:90%
But it has to be in the body.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:90%
But the body's so cool.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:90%
It has these photons.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:84%
It has quantum-physics
particles of light in it

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.455 align:middle line:84%
that can reach
everywhere at once.

00:14:47.455 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
My favorite part of
the body is that it

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:90%
has these little phonons--

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
P-H-O-N-O-N-S. I talk about
it in my "Energy Healing

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:90%
for Trauma."

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:84%
They're these subatomic
particles there,

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and they're created
every time a heart beats.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:84%
every time there's
pressure in the body.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:90%
And you know what they share?

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:84%
In the body is whatever
you're focusing on inside.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you're sitting
there going, woe is me,

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.827 align:middle line:84%
I'm not lovable,
which, come on--

00:15:12.827 --> 00:15:13.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're human.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.993 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do that sometime.

00:15:14.993 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So have a pity party,
and get on with it.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself an hour
to feel that way,

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:90%
and then just say, not anymore.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Do it, and get over it.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But the more we're able to
sense gratitude, goodness--

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, maybe that person wasn't
a jerk because it's me--

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's about
them, not about me--

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
The more we're able to go
to some form of positivity,

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:84%
those little phonons
will share positivity.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:90%
And we're healthier.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle line:90%
It's proven.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:84%
We get healthier when
we think healthier.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And as you say,
oftentimes, our minds are--

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
just they just randomly
have negative thoughts or--

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:90%
DALE: I know.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: --you know, just
useless, more than anything,

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.800 align:middle line:84%
even just random and
kind of neutral thoughts.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:84%
But we're not taking
the time to program them

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.128 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of the energy
we'd like to see manifest.

00:16:04.128 --> 00:16:05.670 align:middle line:84%
DALE: You said that
in the beginning.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:84%
You talked about that
when you introduced it.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.270 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:84%
DALE: Kind of our talk
today is discipline.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't like discipline
any more than anyone else does,

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:90%
but I get up every morning.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I get in the car, I put my dogs
in there, I go to the dog park.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And now I wouldn't be able
to function without it.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Even here, I got to sleep
in because my dogs weren't

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:90%
waking me up because I'm here.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.463 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Because they
want to go to the park.

00:16:29.463 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
DALE: I know, but I still
got up, and I walked outside.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:90%
So we are responsible for--

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.155 align:middle line:84%
even if we have to trick
ourselves into a good habit,

00:16:38.155 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:84%
reward yourself
for a good habit,

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:90%
but not with a worse habit--

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:90%
just start.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Just get one thing going.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.570 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, we're focusing on
autoimmune because this is big.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's getting bigger?

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Tons.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Tons.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:90%
There's different statistics.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I read that anywhere between
30% to 70% of all Americans,

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:84%
probably people
in the world, will

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:84%
have some kind of chronic
condition some time

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, so we know that
there's infections,

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:84%
we know that our
food is inflammatory,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:84%
we know that there's these
little mast cells that come out

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:84%
of our bone marrow
that take over,

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:90%
and then we get inflammation.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
So we know some of what
happens on the physical level,

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.589 align:middle line:84%
but I like to ask
what's happening

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.300 align:middle line:90%
on the invisible level.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.089 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe
autoimmune dysfunctions--

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I would include allergies
and addictions in there, too,

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:84%
because it's a way of
heart being harmed--

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and basically,
autoimmune dysfunctions

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
occur because our immune
system is beating up

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:90%
our healthy cells.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.228 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think our immune
system is trying to do that.

00:17:38.228 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're
trying to be an addict.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're
trying to have allergies.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:90%
So what's happening?

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Typically, it
starts with trauma.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And you know what--
when we're traumatized,

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:84%
when there's an injury from
outside to inside, whether we

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.432 align:middle line:84%
know it or not, there's
energy forces coming into us.

00:17:55.432 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a baseball
that hits us on the head,

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:84%
but there's a physical
force that gets in.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But I believe a lot of
other people's energies

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
enter us when we're
being traumatized.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:84%
We can't process energies
that are not our own.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Now, then you're getting
into incompatible frequencies

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.265 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:18:14.265 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yes, you are.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't process
our own reactions

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.290 align:middle line:84%
to a problem or
a trauma, now, we

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:84%
have a buildup of
our own frequencies,

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.630 align:middle line:84%
of our own feelings,
and our own emotions.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going
to be in trouble

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:84%
because we can't sort
through what's ours

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:90%
and what's not ours.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So sooner or later,
the body's going

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to go, OK, I'm just going
to beat up on everything.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to try
to drive out what's not

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:90%
been dealt with that's my own.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to drive
out these energies that

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.875 align:middle line:90%
aren't my own.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And guess what-- we have
an autoimmune dysfunction.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:84%
We just have an
overactive system

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.520 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't know where the
real enemy is because it's all

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.847 align:middle line:90%
seen as an enemy.

00:18:54.847 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.595 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Isn't it fascinating?

00:18:56.595 --> 00:18:57.395 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It is.

00:18:57.395 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So how does one go about
sorting through that?

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Because it is becoming
more prominent.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:90%
It's on the rise-- autoimmune.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It's not fast.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I do healing work, but I
don't promise people this

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen overnight.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it does.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.720 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I tell a client this
is going to take a long time,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:84%
they're the person that, like,
has the overnight success.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But you have to go
through the process.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So I typically try
to look for, what's

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:84%
the easiest trauma
to get a hold of?

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:90%
What's uppermost?

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:90%
What do they most remember?

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Is it when they were two,
or when they were 10,

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:84%
or what happened with
their last wife or husband?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
You just have to start
somewhere where there's

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:84%
some emotional engagement,
help them feel it,

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
process it, figure out
they didn't deserve it.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Try to uncover what
they might have

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:90%
been subconsciously thinking.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
If you can get your toe
in, you can start on whined

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:90%
to the older, deeper traumas.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And that has to happen before
the body can be convinced

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't need to
have this overreaction

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
to environmental
factors, to foods, to,

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got to have the alcohol,
I have to have the opioids.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think we have to start
with a trauma the person can

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:90%
get a hold of.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:84%
You start somewhere,
and it does unravel.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
If you can stay with
yourself and get

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
somebody loving
to stay with you,

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.840 align:middle line:84%
it actually will
start to unravel.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So the
question, then, is,

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:84%
you feel it almost always
requires a good facilitator?

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult for people
to unravel it on their own?

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yes.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:84%
By the time you have an
autoimmune occurrence,

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
or a deep unwieldy addiction,
or a lot of allergies,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.310 align:middle line:90%
I think we need help.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And we are on this planet
with billions of other people.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
There's somebody there who
can help and who can care.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you need several
people in different orders

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.882 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:20:59.882 --> 00:21:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you just need
somebody to sit

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:84%
with you so you feel accompanied
and loved enough to go deeper.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It's so hard to
do it on our own.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you just need to go
to a 12-step program to start.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So you quit whatever keeps
cycling the reaction.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been in many,
many 12-step programs.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm sort of a 12-step fanatic.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And once in a while, I call
into Al-Anon or this or that

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:90%
because it's used--

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're free, which is
nice, because otherwise,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:84%
this stuff can take a long
time and a lot of money--

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and just hearing somebody else's
story that's like, well, OK,

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling down and I
went for the ice cream,

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:90%
and then I didn't--

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.325 align:middle line:84%
so that can help me say, Cindy,
you go for the ice cream--

00:21:44.325 --> 00:21:45.950 align:middle line:84%
I actually don't go
for the ice cream--

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:46.970 align:middle line:90%
I go for the cookies--

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
you have a tendency
to go for the cookies

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:90%
when you're feeling scared.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:84%
If you don't go for
the cookies, you're

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:90%
going to deal with the fear.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to get to a place

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:84%
where you can work
through the fear

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and do some self-healing
work, and then you're

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:84%
going to be in a
better, healthier place.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
feel better, and you're

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:90%
going to feel stronger.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.037 align:middle line:90%
You know what happens?

00:22:06.037 --> 00:22:07.910 align:middle line:84%
The inflammation goes
down in the body.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Your negative emotions
start to disappear.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:90%
You're not shaming yourself.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:90%
You're not in a shame cycle.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I do think it's
helpful to have people

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.712 align:middle line:90%
however you can get to them.

00:22:19.712 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Now what
about the energies

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.750 align:middle line:90%
that are prevailing around us?

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have our own that we're
generating and creating.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:84%
We have our own subconscious,
our own traumas.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:84%
But right now, you
can almost say--

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get
into the notion of viruses

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:84%
in some of the beings that
help facilitate this--

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:84%
but prior to that, let's talk
about the energy at large.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:84%
We now feel we're being
bathed in a very chaotic soup.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Some people will call
these very dark times.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:48.430 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yes.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So how is the
prevailing energy affecting us?

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It's so strong.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the most
self-aware person right

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:10%
now, usually, has to sit
back and go, is this mine?

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Is this Memorex?

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Or am I picking up
what's in the culture?

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Because it's scary.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:90%
People are scared.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.530 align:middle line:90%
And when you start to get--

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:84%
I typically call them "thought
forms" or "emotional forms."

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.300 align:middle line:90%
They're energetics.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even mean
somebody is doing this to us.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:84%
But when you have enough of the
masses frightened, or scared,

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:84%
or angry-- now anger's
starting to take over, right?

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:84%
First, we did a lot of fear,
now we're doing a lot of anger,

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:90%
now we're doing a lot of rage--

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, that's
a seeking of power.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Fear is like, I'm not safe.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.800 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to get safe?

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.430 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard not to go
with it because that's

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.862 align:middle line:90%
invisible energy.

00:23:41.862 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can turn on
the news and see somebody

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:90%
doing something scary, right?

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's in the air literally.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:90%
There's subtle energies.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:90%
There everywhere.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we really
need to pay attention

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:84%
to what I call our "own
subtle boundaries."

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.460 align:middle line:84%
We have to empower
who we are inside.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:84%
We have to visualize, or
feel, or be who we are,

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and take the actions every
day that help us be stronger.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of it just comes
down to electrical energy.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:84%
We're electrical beings,
and the more electricity

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:90%
we have going through our body--

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:84%
which requires moving,
eating healthy, thinking

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:84%
positive thoughts-- the
more electromagnetic fields

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.550 align:middle line:84%
we have outside of us, the less
apt we are to pick up what's

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.745 align:middle line:84%
hanging in the atmosphere-- the
fear, the anger, the doomsday

00:24:28.745 --> 00:24:29.545 align:middle line:90%
philosophy.

00:24:29.545 --> 00:24:31.212 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: By strengthening
your own field.

00:24:31.212 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:84%
DALE: You strengthen
your own field,

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and you won't pick it
up or catch it quicker.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I can feel when I'm around
somebody who's in terror.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:90%
I take a step back.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.140 align:middle line:84%
You know a really simple
way to deal with it?

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I teach this to my young people.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
You cross your arms
over your solar plexus.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.640 align:middle line:84%
You cut off the openness
of your energy field,

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and whatever somebody
else is going

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.130 align:middle line:84%
through that's overwhelming you,
you're not going to pick it up.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Test anxiety-- I
tell kids do this--

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.480 align:middle line:90%
put an arm over your stomach.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.225 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to pick up
everybody else's text anxiety.

00:25:05.225 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:90%
You can deal with your own.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.048 align:middle line:84%
You can't do with
a room of 30 kids.

00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:09.590 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, this
might also explain

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.215 align:middle line:84%
why people, when they
get into a debate

00:25:11.215 --> 00:25:13.040 align:middle line:84%
her argument with
someone, almost

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:90%
automatically go like this.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
DALE: Yes, they do,
or cross their feet.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.240 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Trying to
protect themselves.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Exactly

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.260 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right?

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:90%
DALE: But it does work.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:84%
DALE: So it's an
overwhelming time.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:84%
We've got to each focus on
what keeps us from bringing

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.605 align:middle line:90%
in what's not our own.

00:25:29.605 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And also, I think,
just to take it a step further

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:84%
before we segue into the next
subject, which is intriguing,

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:84%
is that when we have this
mass anxiety, rage, fear,

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, one of the
terms that is often used

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:45.870 align:middle line:90%
is "egregore."

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:49.140 align:middle line:84%
You're creating an
actual massive entity,

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.830 align:middle line:84%
feeding it, giving it its own
characteristics, which becomes

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:90%
real in another dimension.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It does.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.630 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Now you have to
contend with this massive being

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:90%
that you've created out of rage.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.210 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Exactly.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:90%
It is like a being.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a consciousness,
and it grows.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:04.765 align:middle line:90%
And it runs thing.

00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:05.640 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:84%
DALE: And science is saying
that, at least mathematically,

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
the brain fires in at least
11 dimensions simultaneously.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So some of what we
refuse to deal with--

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I usually think of the
lower dimensions as denser,

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:84%
the higher dimensions
is somewhat more light--

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.470 align:middle line:84%
but you can have bad stuff
in a higher dimension.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:84%
You can have skewed thoughts,
and concepts, and philosophies.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, come on.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:84%
The lower dimensions
are really weighty,

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:84%
so if we don't acknowledge
that we're doing this

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:84%
or it's happening, it just
kind of goes into the corners

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.225 align:middle line:90%
and strikes us when--

00:26:40.225 --> 00:26:42.600 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: When you're feeding
it, unconsciously feeding it.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.830 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.980 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, so let's look
at the notion of viruses.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:84%
You say this in your book,
that viruses are often

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:84%
moved and motivated by
dark forces around us--

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
sometimes other
entities, disincarnate

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.170 align:middle line:90%
beings and so forth.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.750 align:middle line:90%
DALE: I perceive that.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it because
approaching people with viruses

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.750 align:middle line:90%
with that point of view--

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.450 align:middle line:84%
if I'm able to help
them disentangle

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.265 align:middle line:84%
from some kind of entity
or energy outside of them--

00:27:13.265 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And it could be
this egregore, so to speak.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.598 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It can be the egregore.

00:27:16.598 --> 00:27:18.960 align:middle line:90%
It can be anything-- an arcane.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:90%
It can be a family system.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
It can be a family
spirit that wants

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:84%
to still control the family for
generations and generations.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.850 align:middle line:84%
It could be a part of us
from a different life.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.470 align:middle line:90%
We don't always know what it is.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But I assume at this
point that if we

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:90%
have a virus occupying us--

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if
it's Epstein-Barr,

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:90%
SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-1--

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.330 align:middle line:84%
whatever it might be, it's
connected and empowered

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:84%
through what we call a
"cord" in this field,

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.035 align:middle line:90%
through some sort of--

00:27:49.035 --> 00:27:52.710 align:middle line:84%
like, a garden hose to
something outside of us.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's that outside energy or
entity is feeding the virus--

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:90%
because viruses aren't smart.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.430 align:middle line:84%
They have either RNA
or DNA inside of them,

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.660 align:middle line:84%
but scientists don't even really
think they're actually alive.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what they are.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:84%
They don't even say
they're living beings.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:84%
They're like, they're
sort of alive.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:90%
They're sort of not.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
They just carry
these chromosomes

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.500 align:middle line:90%
that take over your cells.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So where's the
brain of the virus?

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.770 align:middle line:90%
It's outside.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So knowing that, you can
send images of light.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
You can just be willing to
be freed up from whatever

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.723 align:middle line:90%
is connected to you.

00:28:29.723 --> 00:28:31.140 align:middle line:84%
You can be willing
to say, I don't

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.700 align:middle line:90%
know what I'm getting out of--

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.910 align:middle line:84%
subconsciously, maybe getting
out or having this being,

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:84%
like, have a hold in my body,
but I want to be done with it.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.257 align:middle line:84%
And you can collapse
viruses that way.

00:28:43.257 --> 00:28:44.090 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Interesting.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about bacteria, too,

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.122 align:middle line:84%
because you say that
they store emotions.

00:28:48.122 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll get
through this because I

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:84%
want to get into the nature
of the aura and so forth.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:51.806 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Excellent.

00:28:51.806 --> 00:28:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.710 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But let's talk
about bacteria for a moment.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yeah.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.430 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: They store emotions,
and it can be dense.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yes.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And they also
have a positive function.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:90%
DALE: They do.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.210 align:middle line:90%
I think they store our emotions.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:84%
DALE: I think they
store the emotions we

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:06.210 align:middle line:84%
haven't let ourselves
feel or we've never

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:08.280 align:middle line:90%
had the chance to feel.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So many people say
that they don't

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.260 align:middle line:84%
start dealing with their trauma
or their childhood issues

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.060 align:middle line:90%
until they're safe.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.830 align:middle line:84%
These days, we
better do it sooner.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.272 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:18.272 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:84%
DALE: But they get
to a safe place,

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.772 align:middle line:84%
and all the sudden, all
their memories come back,

00:29:21.772 --> 00:29:23.250 align:middle line:90%
and they remember being abused.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, they
find out they've

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:84%
had bacteria in their systems
for, hey, most of their lives.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're helping you.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:84%
They're storing what you
need to get around to feel.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So hello, feel the feelings,
and maybe the bacteria

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.035 align:middle line:84%
don't need to be
there operating.

00:29:40.035 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: What about the positive
bacteria, the positive effects.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.575 align:middle line:84%
DALE: Well, there are
positive bacteria.

00:29:43.575 --> 00:29:43.860 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.660 align:middle line:84%
DALE: And I think what
they're processing--

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I think they will
help you process

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:90%
the feelings you are feeling.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think of them as,
like, little holders

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.220 align:middle line:84%
of the positive feelings, like
your joy, your satisfaction.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Again, so it stands to
reason that, especially

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:84%
in your microbiome,
in your gut, when

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:05.790 align:middle line:84%
you feed the positive
bacteria your happy thoughts,

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:08.880 align:middle line:84%
your happy feelings, like,
you notice, oh, my gosh,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.440 align:middle line:90%
this person smiled at me.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.720 align:middle line:84%
The more you pay attention
to the good stuff,

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.090 align:middle line:84%
that feeds the
positive bacteria.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So you can change your
microbiome just need

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.500 align:middle line:90%
to be aware of what's good.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.300 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Wonderful.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to segue
further in to the whole system

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.200 align:middle line:84%
that you have of the 12 chakras,
and the 12 layers of the aura,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and that when we teased
about earlier, the eighth.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But you've said something
very intriguing in your book--

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.630 align:middle line:84%
that we can access universal
messages or knowledge

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:90%
through DNA wormholes.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.010 align:middle line:90%
DALE: I know.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a great phrase.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, it's great.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:84%
DALE: I just love
stuff like that.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.900 align:middle line:84%
When I see that on the internet,
I'm like, I'm going there.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:90%
All Right.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's been research,
especially in Russia, that--

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:84%
they've been able
to look at the DNA--

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and when somebody
has a bright idea,

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:58.100 align:middle line:84%
like a consciousness-raising
idea-- like, wow,

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to be my parents,
or I can love my parents

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and not be them at the same
time, or I can change my life,

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.320 align:middle line:84%
or there's a cool thing
that could happen--

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.120 align:middle line:90%
there's light.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.060 align:middle line:84%
There's wormholes
that come off the DNA.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Those wormholes connect into
a greater field of light.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
There's so many names
for that field of light.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.160 align:middle line:84%
You could call it
"God," "consciousness,"

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.960 align:middle line:84%
"absolute light," "the
zero-point field,"

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.220 align:middle line:90%
"the vacuum," this and that.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.820 align:middle line:90%
But it literally opens up.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:29.210 align:middle line:84%
It reaches out into a greater
field of energy that stores

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:31.370 align:middle line:90%
anything, everything possible.

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I usually think that
that particular field

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:84%
holds virtual light or
what could come into being.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as
you connect to it,

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:84%
what could come into
being enters to the DNA

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.390 align:middle line:84%
through the wormhole, and
it can alter the actual DNA

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.190 align:middle line:90%
programming.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:51.650 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So it's not necessarily
just a light bulb going on.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.533 align:middle line:84%
It's really desirable if
it's a conscious thought,

00:31:55.533 --> 00:31:57.950 align:middle line:84%
a conscious acknowledgement,
and recognition of something.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:58.750 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yes.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.600 align:middle line:90%
You want to get it.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.750 align:middle line:84%
DALE: And I'm sure you've
had this experience.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I know when my head is
trying to get something.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy for me to
think I'm getting it,

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:90%
but I know I'm not.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:10.282 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:32:10.282 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.200 align:middle line:84%
DALE: You just write
it over and over.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.810 align:middle line:84%
You do the affirmations, and
you go, I so don't believe that.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:16.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, be honest with yourself.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember years ago
when people would say,

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.170 align:middle line:84%
you should get out
there and date again.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:21.050 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I'm not ready.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:21.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, you should be ready.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
well, I'm not ready.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.322 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to walk
around going, I'm ready,

00:32:25.322 --> 00:32:28.210 align:middle line:90%
when I'm not ready.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:31.110 align:middle line:84%
When it flashes-- we
have to work on it,

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:84%
but when it flashes, that's
when those bright ideas

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.430 align:middle line:84%
come in and alter our
physical functions.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:38.472 align:middle line:90%
They can change our DNA.

00:32:38.472 --> 00:32:39.680 align:middle line:90%
They can change our thoughts.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.450 align:middle line:90%
They can change our attitudes.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, let's
launch into the notion

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:84%
of these layers of the aura
that we work with, and also,

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.040 align:middle line:90%
the chakras.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And people are probably
most intrigued with eight

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.200 align:middle line:84%
through 12 because they're
fairly familiar with one

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.260 align:middle line:90%
through 7.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's start wherever you'd
like to on that, and what

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the eight through to 12 are
about, how they function,

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.640 align:middle line:90%
on what level, what they serve.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.620 align:middle line:84%
But also, I want to get
into that eighth chakra--

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean that eighth level of the
aura, which you say is black.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Most people-- oh,
that's counterintuitive.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.563 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean you
know black layer?

00:33:14.563 --> 00:33:15.363 align:middle line:90%
DALE: I know.

00:33:15.363 --> 00:33:17.505 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And then I want to
ask a couple things that

00:33:17.505 --> 00:33:19.880 align:middle line:84%
are more personally oriented
about that, experience-wise.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:20.590 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Great.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.300 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:90%
We have seven in-body chakras.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.235 align:middle line:90%
My system talks about those.

00:33:25.235 --> 00:33:27.717 align:middle line:84%
Sir Arthur Avalon forever
talked about them.

00:33:27.717 --> 00:33:29.300 align:middle line:84%
He also said that
there were only six.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:84%
People don't read
the fine print.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.097 align:middle line:84%
And then he said
there's all kinds

00:33:32.097 --> 00:33:34.430 align:middle line:84%
of systems with up to,
like, hundreds, so whatever.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I saw these as a kid,
so I've labeled them.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe the eighth chakra
is right above the head,

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:43.290 align:middle line:84%
and it also connects in through
our thymus, which, of course,

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:45.710 align:middle line:90%
is an autoimmune immune gland.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And boy, wouldn't we want
that active right now?

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.780 align:middle line:84%
That's our mystical
shaman chakra.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.460 align:middle line:84%
That's about our past
lives, and our future,

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.757 align:middle line:84%
and it's when we
do journeying in.

00:33:55.757 --> 00:33:56.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a really cool chakra.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.280 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And a lot of people
attribute those traits

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.200 align:middle line:90%
to the seventh chakra.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:33:59.745 align:middle line:90%
You say, no.

00:33:59.745 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Exactly.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.920 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It's above that.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.250 align:middle line:90%
DALE: No.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's divide this up.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Seventh is spiritual.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.353 align:middle line:84%
It's lovely, but you don't
want to be doing everything

00:34:06.353 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:90%
through your seventh chakra.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.080 align:middle line:90%
You're going to overuse it.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Let it do what it does.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Let the eighth do what it does.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.070 align:middle line:90%
I love the ninth chakra.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It's about an arm's
length about the head.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.550 align:middle line:90%
It's gold.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.210 align:middle line:84%
It holds symbols
that, if they go into

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.340 align:middle line:84%
if, they're brought
down in, especially

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:84%
through the diaphragm, into the
body, they can heal the body,

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.350 align:middle line:90%
they can heal your mind.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.139 align:middle line:84%
They can heal you because
they're your symbols.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So they're the shape-- sort
of like codes from your soul--

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.719 align:middle line:90%
that enable healing in the body.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it happen over
and over, even on animals.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It can help heal animals.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aren't
these cool chakras?

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Why would you not want
to know about them?

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.210 align:middle line:84%
10th chakra--
underneath the feet,

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:50.179 align:middle line:84%
about a foot and a 1/2 in
the ground under the feet--

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:53.600 align:middle line:84%
that's the genetic, the
ancestral, the natural.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.670 align:middle line:84%
That connects you to
nature, the environment,

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.340 align:middle line:90%
I think to the cosmos as well.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.940 align:middle line:84%
The 11th chakra is really strong
around the hands and the feet.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's way out,
also, in the auric field.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But it also lives in
our connective tissue.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And most healers are super
big into connective tissue

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:16.490 align:middle line:90%
because it holds memories.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.690 align:middle line:84%
It holds our memories
and ancestors' memories.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
commanding chakra.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe somebody who really
is able to channel and handle

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.950 align:middle line:84%
their 11th chakra can command
natural and supernatural

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:30.750 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Jesus walking on the
water, raising the dead.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not there yet.

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:35.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm being really honest.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:37.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on my 11th chakra.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:90%
But that's what it is.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.203 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But also using
hands on for healing.

00:35:40.203 --> 00:35:41.490 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Totally.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, or blessing somebody,
just saying, hey--

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.510 align:middle line:84%
or stopping somebody who wants
to attack you, just saying,

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.110 align:middle line:90%
let's be peaceful right now.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.865 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi-- no we're
going to be nonviolent.

00:35:53.865 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to go here.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can feel my
hand giving that energy off.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:90%
The 12th is lovely.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.320 align:middle line:90%
It's unique to each person.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's around the field.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.310 align:middle line:84%
I access it through the
inside of the heart.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:08.670 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of the outer
skein of your own spirit.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I love working with
the 12th to help

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.320 align:middle line:84%
people get a sense of
their own very, very

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.120 align:middle line:90%
special spiritual gift.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Like, what's really
different about them?

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.930 align:middle line:84%
What ability do they
have no one else has?

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:84%
That's what you mine
and excavate there.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So these, to me,
are magical chakras.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.340 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:90%
I love your chakra system.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the levels
of the aura, and explain those.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And then tell us why the
eighth level is black.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And is the eighth level--

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.060 align:middle line:84%
are these aligned with the same
number in the chakra system?

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:40.860 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yes.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.020 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So that would
mean your eighth chakra is

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.520 align:middle line:90%
aligned with the black layer.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:44.910 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Exactly.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, so what
does that mean?

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:46.970 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yes.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:49.665 align:middle line:84%
So I personally
believe-- and people

00:36:49.665 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:84%
can believe what they
want-- but I personally

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:55.680 align:middle line:84%
believe the auric fields are
extensions of the chakras.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think your first
auric field in the hip

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that-- it's right next
to the skin-- it's red,

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and so the first auric field
in and next to the skin

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.260 align:middle line:90%
is also red.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So they're not actually,
always the same

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.880 align:middle line:84%
because your outer
field can hold

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
an issue that doesn't make it
all the way into the chakra.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.075 align:middle line:84%
But the outer fields are usually
programmed by the chakras,

00:37:15.075 --> 00:37:16.950 align:middle line:84%
but you're programmed
by all kinds of things.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right, by life.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.410 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Exactly.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But I also find, outside
of the first auric field,

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.690 align:middle line:90%
the 10th auric field comes next.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:25.922 align:middle line:90%
That was the brown one--

00:37:25.922 --> 00:37:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even give the color
before-- under the feet that's

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:32.280 align:middle line:84%
about ancestry, because
that's the layer that

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.820 align:middle line:84%
holds our history, our
ancestors' history.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.500 align:middle line:84%
You can look in
there to see anything

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.850 align:middle line:84%
that's ever been done to
you, that you've ever done,

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:40.650 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, the
interesting thing about brown

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.100 align:middle line:84%
is brown is a very
grounded and stable color.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:45.900 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It is.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.250 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You'll see
people that work in more

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:90%
conservative industries.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.530 align:middle line:84%
In the days past, when men
wore suits to work, oftentimes,

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.300 align:middle line:84%
like my father,
in his generation,

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.880 align:middle line:84%
in the world of insurance,
they'd wear brown suits--

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:84%
very practical work,
very grounded work.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And your ancestral memories
are practical and grounded.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:90%
DALE: They're real.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:04.810 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That makes sense.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:05.610 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yes.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're here on this Earth,
so don't we want to be grounded

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and picking up on what
nature needs, As well as what

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:90%
we need from it?

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.450 align:middle line:90%
DALE: And then they go in order.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Then we go two
all the way to 12.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And as you go
through these, you've

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.670 align:middle line:84%
got two, which is orange;
and three, which is yellow;

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and et cetera, you get
to eight, which is black.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And people get so
scared of black.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.420 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, that's dark.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.290 align:middle line:90%
That's evil.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.090 align:middle line:90%
The eighth chakra is black.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the shaman chakra,
the mystical chakra.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.494 align:middle line:84%
Your eighth auric
field is black.

00:38:38.494 --> 00:38:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Black attracts energy.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And I've met a lot of shamans,
like real-life shamans

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:47.070 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle in the
savannas-- shamans.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.900 align:middle line:90%
They're about power.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And often, they take people's
energies on and into them

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.070 align:middle line:84%
in order to help
the person heal.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:39:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's sort of what
that black color indicates

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:03.120 align:middle line:84%
is that we have the
capability to absorb.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.700 align:middle line:84%
We can absorb what we need,
we can absorb what's not ours,

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.470 align:middle line:84%
we can connect to spirits we
can bring them into our bodies,

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:12.100 align:middle line:90%
for better or worse.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So black-- I like to call
black the "power color."

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But it mainly works
through absorption.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:21.350 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It does.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:24.040 align:middle line:84%
But what about, also, the notion
that black is also the void,

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.290 align:middle line:90%
it's also the place of plague.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:26.165 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It is the void.

00:39:26.165 --> 00:39:28.080 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's the
darkness under the soil,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.040 align:middle line:84%
it's the womb where things
can be made manifest

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.270 align:middle line:90%
and generate from this quiet.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.070 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Yes.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
shamans ultimately

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:84%
work is that they're experts
at going into the vacuum state,

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.290 align:middle line:90%
or the void--

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.650 align:middle line:84%
which, I just used the word or
the phrase a few minutes ago,

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.830 align:middle line:84%
"virtual light" or
"virtual energy"--

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:54.135 align:middle line:84%
what's in the void but all
possibilities-- it's not empty.

00:39:54.135 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: No, it's not empty.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.250 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It has everything in it.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:57.240 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: It does.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.670 align:middle line:90%
And on a couple of occasions--

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.560 align:middle line:90%
a few occasions, I suppose--

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I went into the void
through various--

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.720 align:middle line:84%
whatever ceremony I
was doing or whatnot.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.960 align:middle line:90%
But in each case, the void--

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:90%
it was like a void--

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:84%
it was darkness all
around, absolutely quiet,

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and absolute plenum, filled
with everything, all knowledge.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Everything was available.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Everything was possible.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything could be known.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But your perception is you're
sitting in this incredibly

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.410 align:middle line:90%
quiet, inky black place.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:33.300 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It's beautiful.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And we create from
here, so shamans absorb,

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.390 align:middle line:90%
and they help you recreate.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:40.290 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right, yeah.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:90%
DALE: And I have a friend.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.717 align:middle line:84%
His name is Dr.
Michael Scroggins.

00:40:43.717 --> 00:40:45.092 align:middle line:84%
He's, like, way
too smart for me.

00:40:45.092 --> 00:40:46.170 align:middle line:90%
He's got like 18 degrees.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:48.760 align:middle line:84%
He's probably got 24 since
I last talked to him.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.930 align:middle line:84%
He talks about the big bang,
which is sort of a void.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like a collapse
of everything,

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:55.770 align:middle line:90%
which is what a void is.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:41:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But he says that you have
to have frequencies outside

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:84%
of a void that match frequencies
in a void for something

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.180 align:middle line:90%
to come to light.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about it,
a shaman can help people--

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:84%
a shaman can hold
what somebody wants,

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and that can stir within
the void of the person

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:20.880 align:middle line:84%
something that could
manifest, something

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.200 align:middle line:84%
that could come to light,
and their life can change.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.390 align:middle line:90%
In there is a cancer-free place.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:84%
In there is a
tumor-free capability.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.017 align:middle line:84%
And so we can do
that for each other.

00:41:32.017 --> 00:41:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what we're
supposed to do for each other.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:35.933 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, it's
interesting the way

00:41:35.933 --> 00:41:37.800 align:middle line:84%
we label these
experiences and the way

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.470 align:middle line:84%
we label even
light, whether we're

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:44.070 align:middle line:84%
talking about light
or absence of light,

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and how we're utilizing them
based on these patterns of fear

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.960 align:middle line:84%
versus on what their
actual potential is.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.760 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Exactly.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.552 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Because it can
actually be flipped.

00:41:52.552 --> 00:41:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, in my experience,
going into the void--

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:55.770 align:middle line:90%
it's absolute.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:90%
There's everything there.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.380 align:middle line:90%
You need nothing.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time, if I'm
going to, say, have a seizure,

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.280 align:middle line:84%
everything's white light, white
light overcoming everything,

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.555 align:middle line:84%
blasts of white light
before going unconscious.

00:42:07.555 --> 00:42:08.355 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Exactly.

00:42:08.355 --> 00:42:09.840 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So this is
kind of flipped.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.695 align:middle line:90%
DALE: I know.

00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:13.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's all there, and how
do we judge how good or bad?

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.040 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:90%
DALE: There isn't.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So we need to
take those labels off.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:16.470 align:middle line:90%
DALE: We do.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.750 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And I ask that
because when I read "black,"

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I thought I want you
to help explain that

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.160 align:middle line:84%
to people not to be
afraid of the dark

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.108 align:middle line:90%
in the purest, truest sense.

00:42:25.108 --> 00:42:25.908 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Exactly.

00:42:25.908 --> 00:42:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.230 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That's different than
dense energies that are sucking

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.760 align:middle line:90%
you down and pulling you under.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.560 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Exactly.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.450 align:middle line:84%
It's potential, and
it's inside all of us.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:37.350 align:middle line:84%
We come from the void, and we're
called out of the void too.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:38.680 align:middle line:90%
So which side is best?

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Being both.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:40.940 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, being both.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, because I
want to get to this

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.880 align:middle line:84%
before the end of
our time together,

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.270 align:middle line:84%
one thing you talk about is
the subtle-energy toolkit.

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Talk about it in general terms.

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:52.650 align:middle line:84%
DALE: So a subtle-energy
toolkit are really

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:56.400 align:middle line:84%
just a few tools easy
and handy you can use

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.080 align:middle line:90%
to shift your subtle energy.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.220 align:middle line:84%
You can use it to activate
the healthy, positive joyous

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:84%
energies inside or deal
with any negative you have

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.080 align:middle line:90%
or that is coming at you.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So in the book "Energy Healing
for Trauma," da, da, da, da

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.470 align:middle line:90%
da--

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I talk about a few
easy techniques.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Like, one is so simple--

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.600 align:middle line:90%
just affirm your own spirit.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Just start with knowing
you're an eternal being,

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.920 align:middle line:84%
every part of you is your
essence, and it's all good.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you just
acknowledge that--

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and if you're with somebody,
acknowledge that they, too,

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.113 align:middle line:90%
are an essential being--

00:43:29.113 --> 00:43:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're always that,
no matter what else they are,

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:35.100 align:middle line:84%
whatever comes on the surface
or ripples over the waves.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.332 align:middle line:84%
And then I, after
those two steps,

00:43:37.332 --> 00:43:39.540 align:middle line:84%
typically then call on what
I would call the "greater

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.530 align:middle line:90%
spirit."

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
word people use.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't care--
"God," "goodness,"

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:90%
"the goodness of humanity."

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.890 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any difference.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:52.560 align:middle line:84%
But if we can open to something
bigger, we can become bigger.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.050 align:middle line:84%
We can become more
than we already are.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:56.670 align:middle line:90%
So I always use that tool.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:01.168 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that all the
energies we need are available.

00:44:01.168 --> 00:44:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I call them "streams of grace."

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.252 align:middle line:84%
Scientists might call
them "scalar waves"--

00:44:04.252 --> 00:44:07.080 align:middle line:84%
maybe not most scientists,
but some scientists.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Everything we need is available.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And if we can see it
going to somebody,

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.190 align:middle line:84%
we offer it to
somebody, we bring them

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:middle line:90%
into ourselves, boom.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.800 align:middle line:84%
We are a tool for grace,
for love in motion,

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.337 align:middle line:90%
love that makes a difference.

00:44:21.337 --> 00:44:22.170 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: I love that.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:23.983 align:middle line:84%
Finally, one thing
in all of this--

00:44:23.983 --> 00:44:25.650 align:middle line:84%
because you talk about
it in your book--

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.900 align:middle line:84%
with everything going
on, the craziness,

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.780 align:middle line:84%
having to kind of
accept each other's

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.650 align:middle line:84%
foibles, and
vulnerabilities, and such,

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:35.190 align:middle line:84%
the role of forgiveness
and healing the field.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:36.570 align:middle line:84%
DALE: It's all
about forgiveness.

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:37.450 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:39.690 align:middle line:10%
If we can forgive, we detach.

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:42.060 align:middle line:10%
I don't mean detach
in a negative way.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.390 align:middle line:10%
We separate out.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:44.940 align:middle line:10%
We can be who we are.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.130 align:middle line:10%
We let the other be
who they are and.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:49.500 align:middle line:10%
The biggest thing
is forgive yourself.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Forgive yourself.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.920 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Final thoughts
before we say goodbye.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.050 align:middle line:84%
DALE: I just want to say
the word "grace" again.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:56.860 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I love your
streams of grace.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.130 align:middle line:90%
DALE: I know.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:57.990 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.680 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.763 align:middle line:90%
DALE: It's love in motion.

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Just be love in motion.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.230 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, I've
said this before

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.020 align:middle line:84%
in a couple other interviews,
that the physicist William

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Taylor says it to him--

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:11.820 align:middle line:84%
the universe is filled
with a universal solvent,

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and that universal
solvent that makes

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.780 align:middle line:84%
all things possible
in all dimensions

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.790 align:middle line:90%
is what we know as love.

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And that feeds into your
streams of grace perfectly.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.660 align:middle line:90%
So Cyndi, thank you so much.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:23.530 align:middle line:90%
I love your energy.

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:24.530 align:middle line:90%
I love your information.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I love the simplicity
of your toolkit.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.060 align:middle line:90%
DALE: Thank you.

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:27.860 align:middle line:90%
So be it.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.190 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, so be it.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.040 align:middle line:10%
Again, the title of the book
is "Energy Healing," which you

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.633 align:middle line:10%
can find at major booksellers.

00:45:33.633 --> 00:45:35.550 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.620 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.670 align:middle line:90%
