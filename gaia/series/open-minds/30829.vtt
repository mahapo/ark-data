00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: For
thousands of years,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.760 align:middle line:84%
people have been using astrology
to rule countries, plan

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.100 align:middle line:84%
military strategy,
choose a wedding date,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:90%
and get a jump on the markets.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Monte Farber has been using
his knowledge of astrology,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:84%
as well as his
psychic abilities,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to guide thousands of people,
including some of the world's

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.525 align:middle line:84%
wealthiest, to favorable
outcomes in the world of money.

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
He is with us today to give us
a glimpse of what we can expect

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:84%
in 2013, and a glimpse back
at why certain events occurred

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:84%
in the past which will give
us a context to our future.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound about right?

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.245 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTE FARBER:
It does actually.

00:00:49.245 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm glad to hear it.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.583 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Not too complex.

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just the past
and the future.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just the
past and the future.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:10%
I think that there is
probably no single subject

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:10%
on the planet that causes
more stress, anxiety,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:10%
and overall fear than money.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, to have access
to someone like you that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
can help people get a little
jump on what's going to happen

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:90%
is a real gift.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And you do this at large,
not just for individuals,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:84%
although you've guided some
of the world's wealthiest.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.795 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I do.

00:01:16.795 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:10%
I like to do it on my
website, and I do it

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.602 align:middle line:10%
on Facebook and Twitter.

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:10%
And every once in
a while I do what

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:10%
I call tweetchings, which
I'm trying to teach people

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:10%
astrology for themselves
because I won't last forever.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
it's not something

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.149 align:middle line:84%
that I have some
amazing gift, I'm

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:84%
just using principles
that have been around

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years
and applying them

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:84%
to the modern age with an
eye towards bringing them

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:90%
into reality.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.811 align:middle line:84%
But the reality of today is not
the reality of four years ago.

00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:47.352 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get into all of that

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
because we have
different factors.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
We have corruptions in the
program that have occurred,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.207 align:middle line:84%
and that really skews any kind
of natural cosmic influence.

00:01:57.207 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Well if you're talking about
the stock market in particular,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I won't work with
anyone who won't

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
admit to me that the
stock market is gambling--

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: --because if
they won't admit that then

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.804 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to get along.

00:02:09.804 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, there were, in
times past-- it's gambling,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:84%
but you could-- like the Elliott
wave-- you could kind of rely

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
on certain mass psyche changes
of direction throughout time,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:90%
and there were patterns to that.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's--

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Yeah, because the
house wasn't rigged then.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.041 align:middle line:84%
But now the house is rigged
with computer trading.

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
into that in a little bit.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And I thought what
we'd do is start out

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:84%
to create a little bit
of a framework for this.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Are there certain planets
and certain positions

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
that have the greatest impact
on the economy in general.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.069 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well it's interesting
that in your introduction

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned the
past and the future

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.026 align:middle line:84%
because that's really the way
you have to approach it now.

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
What was it like in the past
and what is it like now?

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the future
coming up is going

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.196 align:middle line:90%
to be even more different.

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:84%
In the past, it was
mainly Jupiter and Saturn

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:90%
that people would use.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn is the last planet
you can see with the naked eye.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn has to do with
structure, restriction.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is a builder.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is Chronos, time,
you know, the god Chronos

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:90%
and Saturn are the same.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:84%
When Jupiter is ascendant
in the chart of a company,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:84%
because companies have
charts-- how to do them

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
is a whole other-- like, the
United States has a chart,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:90%
different countries have charts.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:84%
When Jupiter is active
then there's expansion.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
When Saturn is active
there's contraction.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:84%
The other planets you can look
at but they're more long term

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:90%
moving.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is in a
sign for one year;

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Saturn's in a sign
for 2 and 1/2 years.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So what an astrology
chart is is a big clock.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.672 align:middle line:84%
It sort of looks like
the Gaiam logo actually.

00:03:45.672 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The flower
of life a bit.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.338 align:middle line:10%
>>FARBER: The flower of life.

00:03:48.338 --> 00:03:50.910 align:middle line:10%
And an astrology chart
looks like a pizza

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:10%
with 12 slices and 10 toppings,
and those are the planets.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:10%
The moon, of course,
is very important.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:10%
Astrologers in the past
who focused on finances

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:10%
did focus mainly on
Jupiter and Saturn

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.350 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes on
Uranus and Neptune

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:10%
because when Uranus
comes into play--

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.314 align:middle line:10%
let's say Uranus
and Jupiter come

00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:10%
into play, that's
explosive growth.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And when Uranus and
Saturn comes into play,

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:90%
it's explosive contraction.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
So I use keywords to teach
people in these tweechings

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that I do because if you use the
keywords it's not complicated.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
However, what is
complicated is when

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:84%
you have to start
plotting the chart.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you have a
couple of different countries--

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get to this in
more detail later-- but

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
you just said each
country has a chart.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at a very
strange dynamic globally,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
what's happening to the
economy with a lot of fraud

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and corruption, and as
you say, computers taking

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:90%
over the trading and so forth.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: That's
the biggest one.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.388 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
at the same time,

00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:84%
each country that's
involved has its own chart,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and its own dynamic
and rise and fall.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it more complex
in terms of trying to even--

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: That's why the
psychic comes in so happily.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.645 align:middle line:84%
Because that's why I
won't work with people

00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
who won't admit
that it's gambling

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:84%
because in gambling
you have a 50/50 chance

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be heads or tails.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you're using the
psychic, all of a sudden,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:84%
you're favoring yourself rather
than the house's favorites.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're accurate as
a psychic, which I am,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm accurate 70,
80% of the time,

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
you can make money with that
kind of an accuracy rate.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.650 align:middle line:84%
The house-- I think
in Las Vegas it's

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:84%
60 something percent,
their advantage.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.936 align:middle line:90%
And they do OK.

00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do OK.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But then, that's because you're
able to tap into the prevailing

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.777 align:middle line:84%
energies and the
movement of energies.

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the people
who watch Gaiam TV know

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:90%
about the Akashic record.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Or if they're into
quantum physics

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:84%
they know about
the quantum field.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Well what I tell people
is, being psychic

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is not learning how to tap
into the Akashic record

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
or learning how to tap
into the quantum field,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:90%
you're part of it.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:90%
You're tapped in all the time.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:84%
It's learning how to
get out of your own way

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.345 align:middle line:90%
and getting that information.

00:06:07.345 --> 00:06:08.466 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, taking
those filters off so

00:06:08.466 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:90%
you can access it.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.218 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Taking
those filters off.

00:06:10.218 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:90%
And I do that.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.794 align:middle line:84%
I know how to just shut myself
up because, at a certain point,

00:06:16.794 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hear
what I have to say.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm like everybody else.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You get bored
with yourself too.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.306 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Because I'm wrong.

00:06:22.306 --> 00:06:24.970 align:middle line:84%
But the Akashic field and the
quantum field is always right.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm wrong it's
not because the psychic gift,

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, the
voice is wrong, it's

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't listen right.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to-- astrology
helps, it gives me an edge,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.540 align:middle line:84%
but when you're dealing
with that many variables,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:84%
you're better off
using your intuition.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And so many mathematical
inventions, so many inventions

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds, have been
occurred to people in dreams

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:84%
or when they got out
of their own way.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, when
they're in an alpha state,

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:84%
they're just spaced out,
and boom, it arrives.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
they come to me.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And I got people
into Apple at 65,

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:84%
so I have a lot
of happy clients,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and I have people-- The
weirdest thing I ever did

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.862 align:middle line:84%
was getting people into
AIG when it was $0.21.

00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I bet.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They tripled
their money in two weeks.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.757 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so it's-- the
psychic stuff is--

00:07:14.757 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some of it
looks counterintuitive.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: It sounds crazy, yes.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:90%
And I say that to them.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:84%
I say, to me, I wouldn't do
it, but that's what I hear.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.846 align:middle line:84%
And so some of them
did and some of them

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:84%
didn't, and some of them
tripled their money.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.344 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we all
have those moments

00:07:29.344 --> 00:07:31.317 align:middle line:84%
where we think, oh
my god, why didn't I

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:84%
just listen to what
I knew to be true.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I just talked to a friend I
hadn't talked to in 12 years,

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:84%
just a few days ago, and
said, first off, you know,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:90%
I should have listened to you.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:90%
And he's, what?

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.770 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about it?

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.791 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I should
have bought Apple at 7.

00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
He said no, $7, I swear to
god, the company still has--

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: It's like Forest Gump.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --something left.

00:07:51.515 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, he invests a lot in it.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, even you know,--

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And it's knowing
when to sell, also.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:58.185 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: That's
the harder part.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go back
to 2008 because that's

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
a really critical turning
point in, certainly,

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
the history of
the United States,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.561 align:middle line:90%
but also the global economy.

00:08:09.561 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: It was a big hiccup.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.226 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
going on there,

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and was there a reflection
of that in times past?

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And how did that
look according--

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.250 align:middle line:84%
say, in contrast to
the Great Depression

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:90%
or other big downturns?

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It's always
fear and greed, right?

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.046 align:middle line:90%
That's what they always say.

00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:10%
And in 2008, the
credit default swaps

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:10%
reached the point that--
There is something called

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.130 align:middle line:10%
derivatives, and
what they've done

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:10%
is they keep inventing
financial instruments.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I actually met the person who
invented what's called a SPYDR,

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:90%
which is S-P-

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.621 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I
haven't heard of that.

00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Y-D-R. And he
made a fortune inventing

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
these financial instruments that
are basically cobbled together.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.471 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a car with
six wheels and two of them

00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:84%
turn one way and two of
them turn the other way.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But they make their money on
the selling of the instruments,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and they don't really think
about what could happen.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.530 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the
economy of the world

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:84%
is tied to this casino
with the most greedy people

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.199 align:middle line:90%
running the casino, and--

00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally rigged.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: There's 60-- I
think it's over $60 trillion

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
worth of unlooked at financial
instruments, the credit

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.937 align:middle line:84%
default swaps, derivatives,
that are unregulated.

00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:23.270 align:middle line:90%
They never see the light of day.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And what it is is they're
insuring each other

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
against someone
not paying a loan.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is if it
hiccups even a little bit,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:84%
the repercussions
are what we saw.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And then they let
Goldman Sachs go down.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.224 align:middle line:84%
And then-- I mean,
not Goldman Sachs they

00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:42.830 align:middle line:90%
let down, the other one.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.072 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend, I won't
say his name, he kept--

00:09:46.072 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bear Stearns.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.613 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:09:47.613 --> 00:09:50.627 align:middle line:84%
He was going to be working
for Bear Stearns, and he said,

00:09:50.627 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:90%
are they going to go down?

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'm
reading the owner,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:90%
and he thinks everything's fine.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And he did, right up
until they took him out.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if
you're looking at it

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:84%
from kind of a
cosmological point of view,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.474 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:10:06.474 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because these
influences-- yeah,

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:84%
we have human nature,
we have-- and then

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
we have the excessive greed
and excessive fear that

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.105 align:middle line:84%
causes these big
wobbles in the market,

00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
but what was going
on cosmically?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: There was
nothing astrological.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No?

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.096 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: There was
nothing astrological

00:10:20.096 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
that you would look
at it 10 years before

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh my god, in 2008 it's
really going to hit the fan.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.739 align:middle line:84%
There with there was
nothing like that.

00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Now what about, say,
in the US's chart?

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:84%
There has been a
now spec that's been

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:84%
going on I think for
a couple of years now

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that is moving into a
period of revolution.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Any time you hear
revolution, fellow astrologers,

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.240 align:middle line:90%
it's Uranus.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Uranus is the planet
of revolution.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And America is a revolutionary
country to begin with.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But there's three
charts for America.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you do
charts for America,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
you have to reconcile the
three if you really want to go.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
You can see why I
became more of a psychic

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:84%
because you can spend all
day-- Winston Churchill said

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to have a one-handed
economist because they'd always

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
come and say, on the one hand
this on the other hand this.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But I want to give people
a definitive answer

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:84%
because the people I work
for, if I'm not right,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:90%
they won't work with me again.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.202 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the
movie business.

00:11:16.202 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:84%
If you're not good,
you don't work.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So, I guess what I
was trying to get to,

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:84%
where my mind's going
in a roundabout way,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.284 align:middle line:84%
is if we're inching up toward
a period of revolution,

00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:27.575 align:middle line:90%
social, political, revolution--

00:11:27.575 --> 00:11:28.533 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: You mean now?

00:11:28.533 --> 00:11:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, over
the last couple years

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and now, and even more so in
the next couple of years, then

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:84%
2012 was a really
pivotal year in terms

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:90%
of the steaming up that energy.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Than it would seem only
logical that you're

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.895 align:middle line:84%
going to have some kind of
erratic behavior in the market.

00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Oh, for sure.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A manic or
a depressive whatever.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: I do
think there's going

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to be a lot of trouble
in the Middle East.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.874 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't have
to be a genius psychic

00:11:51.874 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:90%
or astrologer to see that.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.110 align:middle line:84%
But I actually fear
sometimes, because of my work

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
with my friend Sitchin, that
the past indicates the future.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And there was a nuclear exchange
in around 2000 whatever, 100

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
BC, there might actually
be a nuclear exchange

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
That would completely
destabilize the markets.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But the markets don't need
help destabilizing themselves--

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.026 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:12:14.026 --> 00:12:16.595 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: --because of what you
said before, program trading.

00:12:16.595 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: They trade on fear.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And if they see little
movements, they trade big.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's very hard.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:84%
If someone comes
to me and says--

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're a small
investor-- I say,

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:90%
there's other ways to do it.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, commodities still
have a modicum of connection

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:90%
to the real world.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And they, like stocks,
were originated

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:84%
as a hedge for
farmers because you're

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:90%
going to have to deliver.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.825 align:middle line:84%
And so you do all these things--
The way investments used

00:12:45.825 --> 00:12:49.830 align:middle line:84%
to actually be, to have a
company that made a product.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:90%
No longer.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's financial
instruments, derivatives.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
That's where the big
money is, so that's

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
where the really
greedy people are.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.282 align:middle line:90%
And they're smart.

00:12:59.282 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Just because they're
greedy doesn't

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
mean that they're
not really smart.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:02.831 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:05.325 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at this from
the perspective of the psychic.

00:13:05.325 --> 00:13:05.866 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: OK.

00:13:05.866 --> 00:13:08.074 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So 2008 happened.

00:13:08.074 --> 00:13:10.240 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, and we've
been on the path to recovery

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.490 align:middle line:90%
ever since.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I don't
really see that.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:13.883 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Me either.

00:13:13.883 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know more
people that are--

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Out of work.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.526 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that haven't been
able to find jobs for years,

00:13:18.526 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and so they're just
taken out of the tally.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But also, the whole next
generation, my son's generation

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and younger, these guys, their
degrees are worth nothing.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:90%
It's toilet paper.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.694 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to get--
unless you have a highly

00:13:29.694 --> 00:13:32.230 align:middle line:84%
specialized area, a
certain kind of tech jobs,

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.952 align:middle line:84%
engineering, medical,
at a higher end.

00:13:34.952 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Other than that there's just
not that much out there.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: There's not.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.015 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them are going
to have to leave the country.

00:13:40.015 --> 00:13:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I know that that
sounds crazy, but they

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.254 align:middle line:84%
might have to be the
interesting sounding foreigner

00:13:45.254 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
in another country
the way we have

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
so many interesting
sounding foreigners

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:90%
that used to come to--

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That,
you're seeing now?

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I do actually.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.524 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people are going

00:13:52.524 --> 00:13:54.080 align:middle line:84%
to start going to
other countries

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:84%
because the other
countries will want

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.627 align:middle line:84%
to have someone who has that
nice American accent the way

00:14:00.627 --> 00:14:02.626 align:middle line:84%
we have people that want
the nice French accent,

00:14:02.626 --> 00:14:04.850 align:middle line:84%
or the British
accent, or whatever.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.144 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of smart people here.

00:14:07.144 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately they're
not in government,

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and they are not doing
what they should be doing.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:90%
They're not leading.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.470 align:middle line:84%
In the book of Tao, it says, one
who would lead must follow all.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
They are not out for me,
and you, and your son.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:90%
They're out to get elected.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.944 align:middle line:90%
For what reason, I have no idea.

00:14:23.944 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and this
is happening not just

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:84%
at the younger end of the
spectrum, this leaving

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:90%
the country you're mentioning.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I was in Chiang Mai,
Thailand, a few years ago,

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.737 align:middle line:84%
and there's a huge ex-pat
community of pensioners.

00:14:35.737 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.611 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: British and American.

00:14:37.611 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Because for $1,200 a month
you can live very, very well.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: You can.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
you can barely eat

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:84%
food that's not out of a can
from a discount warehouse here.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.202 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: No.

00:14:48.202 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it happening.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.534 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
a lot of people

00:14:50.534 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:84%
renouncing their
American citizenship.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:84%
One of the founders of I
think Google, no, no Facebook,

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:84%
just became a
citizen of Singapore.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Then you have
Denise Rich, and she

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
renounced her
American citizenship.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:90%
I think she went to Austria.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:90%
And I live out in the Hamptons.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.905 align:middle line:90%
They go where the money is.

00:15:08.905 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about your people out there

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:middle line:84%
because that's a
very wealthy area,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's very different
than how most of us live.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we're watching
programs on the big screen

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
or little screen, including
shows directly located

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.137 align:middle line:84%
in the Hamptons,
and saying, oh yeah,

00:15:24.137 --> 00:15:25.470 align:middle line:90%
that's how the other half lives.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.935 align:middle line:84%
So you deal with a lot
of wealthy and famous.

00:15:27.935 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I do.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
from that perspective what's

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:84%
happening with money, what
the psychology is, and then we

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.880 align:middle line:84%
can trickle the
conversation from there.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They're just
like us if we had money.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:90%
They worry about keeping it.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:90%
They worry about getting more.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.315 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one classic example is,
I write books like my "Qauntum

00:15:46.315 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Affirmations" books about how
individuals-- because we each

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:84%
create our own future,
our own destiny.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:90%
I know that that's a fact.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And just because
the world economy

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:84%
is going in the toilet-- I
use my "Qauntum Affirmations"

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.329 align:middle line:90%
thing, I'm doing fine.

00:16:01.329 --> 00:16:03.495 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about the world
because I'm an Aquarius.

00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have
a moon in Aquarius,

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:06.630 align:middle line:90%
so we care about the future.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:84%
We care about other
people because we're

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:84%
pretty strong
people individually.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:90%
So, I want to help people.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.580 align:middle line:84%
They are worried
about keeping it,

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
they're worried about
their family keeping it.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.490 align:middle line:84%
They're exactly like
us except the problems

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
are the problems
of having money.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And so, they don't
really-- a lot

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:90%
of them are very charitable.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
are just like you

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and me that somehow
have all this money.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
But they're as worried about
the government as we are.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:44.927 align:middle line:90%
A lot of the wealthy--

00:16:44.927 --> 00:16:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
a different scale.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, they
don't feel like they're

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:90%
being protected either.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.253 align:middle line:84%
They think that
they're being hung out

00:16:50.253 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to dry as rich people are
bad, and that for some reason

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.111 align:middle line:84%
they're not entitled to have
what they're supposed to have.

00:16:57.111 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you really want
to be a spiritual person,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.555 align:middle line:84%
you can't be a spiritual
person and then

00:17:00.555 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:90%
say rich people are bad.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: You have
to like everybody.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.413 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are going to
talk about that in some depth,

00:17:05.413 --> 00:17:08.954 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted to go on another
track for a moment with them.

00:17:08.954 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Sure.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wrote
in your book that fear

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.180 align:middle line:90%
is endemic to humanity.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.772 align:middle line:84%
It's not like just
because you're

00:17:15.772 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:90%
wealthy you don't have fears.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:90%
You have fears.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.351 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: They have more.

00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:20.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Often
more, but I wanted

00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
to ask you about the
qualitative difference

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.408 align:middle line:84%
when you're reading
for people and you're

00:17:24.408 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:90%
looking at the picture at large.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.277 align:middle line:84%
You liken their fears to being
on a roller coaster ride.

00:17:28.277 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
oh, here you have it,

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and boom, you
better hang onto it.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:84%
It's almost a thrill
factor involved.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Where for a woman who
has a couple of kids,

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
sole support for her family,
and has lost her job,

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:84%
now that's a kind of
bone-crushing fear of survival.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.660 align:middle line:90%
A different kind of fear.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It's much--
yes-- it's much worse.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:84%
When I do work with
someone in that situation,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:84%
my main concern is that they
calibrate their aspirations,

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.647 align:middle line:90%
what they want to affirm.

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:10%
And that's where I was
going before-- which I just

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:10%
realized that's where I was
going before-- is that I tell

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:10%
them, what you should be
affirming is my bills are paid,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.270 align:middle line:10%
and seeing your bills paid
with the problems that

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:15.475 align:middle line:10%
come with your bills paid.

00:18:15.475 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:10%
Because my "Quantum
Affirmations"

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:10%
is all about seeing the good
and the bad of everything

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.412 align:middle line:10%
because everything
is good and bad.

00:18:21.412 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:84%
When you get a billion
dollars, the first thing

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.567 align:middle line:84%
you're worried about is, oh
my god, it's only $1 billion.

00:18:26.567 --> 00:18:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the government
will take more than half.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They'll take more than
half, and what about the guy--

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:84%
When I worked on a movie
called "The Money Pit,"

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and I worked with a very,
very wealthy person--

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.897 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I remember.

00:18:34.897 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: I realized that
no wealthy person thinks

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
they're wealthy because
they know someone who's

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:39.903 align:middle line:90%
much more wealthy than they are.

00:18:39.903 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So they think that, oh my
god-- it's the law of one

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:90%
but it's a different version.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like I only have
$1 million, or I only

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
have one $10 million I
only have one $100 million.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.150 align:middle line:84%
They worry about things
because the human condition

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:90%
seems to be one of worry.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So I try and get people to
keep things in perspective.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:84%
You should have as your
goal your bills are paid,

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:84%
your kids are healthy, you have
enough money for-- Don't, I

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
want to see myself
winning the lottery,

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:84%
because if you win
the lottery you're

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
going to lose half
of it or more,

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and the relatives will
come out of the woodwork,

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.686 align:middle line:90%
and you'll screw it up somehow.

00:19:17.686 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And I once was working with
someone who was very wealthy.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling him I
was writing this book.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.945 align:middle line:84%
And he says, wow,
I'm going to do that.

00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to visualize
asking for a billion dollars.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.245 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what?

00:19:27.245 --> 00:19:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, well, he
has a few hundred million,

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:84%
why shouldn't he be asking
for a billion dollars?

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, wow, it
really is true, isn't it?

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.732 align:middle line:84%
And that's what was going on,
and that is what's going on.

00:19:40.732 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:90%
They are afraid of losing it.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:84%
They are afraid--
and this is going

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:84%
to sound so odd, especially in
inherited situations-- they're

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:84%
worried about seeming
bad to their family

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.450 align:middle line:84%
or to their father
or their mother,

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:90%
or screwing up the dynasty.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, in Japan they adopt
people to run companies.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:84%
When they say a company has been
family run for 400 years or 300

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.580 align:middle line:90%
years--

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
mean biological.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:90%
They have adopted people.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.207 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Adults.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To do that.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.716 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
have adopted adults

00:20:09.716 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:84%
who they feel can
run their companies.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.126 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the world
is a crazy place.

00:20:14.126 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we could adopt some
people in the United States

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:90%
to run some things.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.320 align:middle line:90%
No kidding.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking about scalable
solutions and affirmations,

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
so if a person is in that
position, as you said,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
you want to have the security
of knowing your bills are paid--

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Bills are paid.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --your
children are fed,

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and your children are
healthy, and that's

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:31.605 align:middle line:90%
where you really begin.

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: That's attainable.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Because that is attainable.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I try
and make people see.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.560 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I feel like a rich person.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm working with
my friends who really

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
are what the newspapers
would call a rich person,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I will say sometimes,
let me buy you dinner.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:90%
And they'll say, no, no.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say, but I'm rich.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.056 align:middle line:90%
And they laugh, and they laugh.

00:20:55.056 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But then they say,
you know what?

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:84%
You really are rich
because I don't

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:90%
have the fears that they do.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what you said.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them, the money
doesn't solve anything.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It sort of makes their life more
miserable because first of all,

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:84%
they don't know if
anyone likes them

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:84%
for themselves or
for their money.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like being
attractive, as you know.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Are people liking you
because you're attractive?

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Are people liking you because
you're in show business,

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
or are people liking you--
It's the same exact thing.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Or do people want what I want
to say or do they want to know

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:84%
what the psychic
voice has to say?

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's all very logical.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.086 align:middle line:84%
It just requires
putting yourself

00:21:34.086 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:90%
in someone else's position.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.584 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
learning astrology

00:21:36.584 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
is so useful because it helps
you to realize the ways we're

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.085 align:middle line:84%
all the same and the
ways we're all different.

00:21:42.085 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what you
mentioned a moment ago

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.251 align:middle line:84%
is something that was reflected
to me, and that I think

00:21:46.251 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:90%
is so important to consider.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Just what you said.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing
John Demartini,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and he was talking about
the hierarchy of values.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, people are
not honest with themselves

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.520 align:middle line:84%
about what they
genuinely value in life.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So, say you lose your
job, but your job

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:90%
was just there to pay the bills.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not your passion.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Money isn't even your passion,
it's a means to an end.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And you suddenly start
changing your affirmation

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:84%
to I need to have a job making
$50 or $100 or $150,000 a year.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's born out
of fear and panic.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:15.633 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:22:15.633 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When your hierarchy
of values may actually be

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.940 align:middle line:84%
you want to spend as
much time as possible

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:90%
with your family and loved ones.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
conflict going on.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal with people that
have these conflicting value

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:84%
systems where they're saying
they want one thing out of fear

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:84%
but, in reality, they want
something entirely different?

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:10%
>>FARBER: Well, in the five-fold
technique that I didn't really

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:10%
evolve for the "Quantum
Affirmations" book,

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:10%
I found that I've
used it my whole life.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:10%
The first thing is
identify your goal.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.546 align:middle line:10%
And this is, for some people,
the hardest thing in the world.

00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I do psychic
readings for people I'll say,

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:46.390 align:middle line:90%
what you want?

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.475 align:middle line:84%
And people look at me
like, well I don't know,

00:22:49.475 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:90%
or I want a million dollars.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:90%
I say, no.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.332 align:middle line:90%
Or, I want to find my soulmate.

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And what they really
mean is I want

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:84%
to feel good about living
alone because I don't want

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:84%
a guy coming in and
messing up my life,

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and I want to feel
good about it.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
The hierarchy of values
that I try and teach people

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:90%
is what do you really want.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what you want
is to be healthy and have

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:90%
your bills paid.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.970 align:middle line:90%
That you can do.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Set that as your goal first.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:90%
You can build on them of course.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that I don't
want-- my reach doesn't exceed

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.660 align:middle line:90%
my grasp, like the saying goes.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But keep your goals
logical, and keep

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.390 align:middle line:84%
them scale-- like you
said, scalability.

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.234 align:middle line:84%
It's keep them
scalable to your life.

00:23:32.234 --> 00:23:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And then you'll attain them.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.358 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And truthful.

00:23:34.358 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because--

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:35.645 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:23:35.645 --> 00:23:35.920 align:middle line:90%
And what's real.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.253 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --if you have those
things taken care of maybe

00:23:38.253 --> 00:23:40.669 align:middle line:84%
what you really love is doing
triathlons, or whatever.

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And you
need time for that.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.126 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Photography.

00:23:43.126 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And you need time,
you need to just not

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.897 align:middle line:84%
have the fear on your plate of
taking care of the essentials.

00:23:48.897 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: It's true.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And I work from my own case,
what has worked for me.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm just some
kid from Brooklyn

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
with a mentally ill mother
and a police sergeant father,

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and I've done really
well for myself.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I have a wonderful relationship
for 38 years, which

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
is my greatest
achievement, and the thing

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:06.740 align:middle line:90%
that I value the most.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's why you're
so wealthy because you put that

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.110 align:middle line:90%
at the top of your--

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: And they know it.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.161 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --hierarchy of values.

00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Put the
relationship first

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.006 align:middle line:90%
is the secret of our book.

00:24:15.006 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:84%
We did a book called
"A Soulmate Path,"

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and we were asked to do
a book on relationships.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:84%
They said, we want
to know your secrets.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And we said, we don't
have any secrets.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, you
better get some secrets

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:84%
because we want you
to do this book.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
It turned out, when we
sat down to write it,

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:84%
as often happens, we
realized, individually,

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:84%
in different rooms, put
the relationship first

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
as the reason, ahead of your
kids, ahead of your parents,

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
ahead of your
friends, or your pets.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we've had
this great relationship.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've
attained wealth.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: That's real wealth.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:42.568 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:24:42.568 --> 00:24:45.187 align:middle line:84%
On your scale and in
your priority of values.

00:24:45.187 --> 00:24:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.319 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's number
one on an individual level,

00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:90%
for everyone.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, the--

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to identify that.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.035 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: --first
rule of warfare

00:24:52.035 --> 00:24:53.100 align:middle line:90%
is make your base secure.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So, this is what I don't
like about the government

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.270 align:middle line:90%
because our base is not secure.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: And this guy Col.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Clausewitz, who was
the founder of-- who

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:84%
wrote the book on
modern warfare way

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:84%
back-- he's was
Prussian colonel.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:90%
It makes so much sense.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.942 align:middle line:84%
If you're standing
on a teeter-totter,

00:25:11.942 --> 00:25:13.900 align:middle line:84%
you can't-- like, the
United States is standing

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:84%
on a teeter-totter telling
the world what to do.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's laughing
because-- put your house

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.130 align:middle line:84%
in order before you start--
United States has a lot

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:90%
of smart people and--

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of
psychopaths, too.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: A lot of psychopaths.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And one would say
that people who

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.921 align:middle line:84%
want to do these kind of
financial shenanigans,

00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and the credit default
swaps, and all this stuff

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.378 align:middle line:84%
without considering
what it's going

00:25:37.378 --> 00:25:41.210 align:middle line:84%
to do the world-- I personally
know people who were affected

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:84%
by the Qualcomm disaster,
and by the Enron disaster.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Lost everything.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:84%
These are people in
their 70s and 80s.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And my wife shows her clothes
at Bergdorf Goodman, crossroads

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.900 align:middle line:84%
of the world, Fifth Avenue,
57th Street, Manhattan,

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:90%
most expensive real estate.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Tiffany's, store
out of business,

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:84%
store out of business,
store-- still, since 2008.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I don't like
about what our government is

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.180 align:middle line:84%
doing at the local, city,
state-- it's not just

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:90%
the president.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:90%
There is a lack of leadership.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.660 align:middle line:84%
They are not doing
what has to be done.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.299 align:middle line:84%
They are not making
their base secure.

00:26:17.299 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I try and tell
people on an individual level.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.805 align:middle line:84%
Make your base secure,
your bills are paid

00:26:21.805 --> 00:26:22.939 align:middle line:90%
and you're healthy.

00:26:22.939 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's it for us on
just a really basic level

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:90%
in terms of--

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: But it's so important.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.279 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very,
very important.

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And also your book
"Quantum Affirmations,"

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.667 align:middle line:90%
you call them quantumplations.

00:26:34.667 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.340 align:middle line:84%
That also guides
people through that,

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.740 align:middle line:90%
is how to really get honest.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:84%
One thing you've done
here, it's not airy-fairy.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:42.550 align:middle line:90%
It's about--

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: It works.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --Down and dirty,
getting honest with yourself.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: I drive a really
nice car, I eat really well,

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:90%
and I don't worry about money.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And how many people can say
they don't worry about money?

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I have money coming in every
month because-- it's not a lot,

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:90%
but it's enough to pay my bills.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Enough that you're
rich in the real sense

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:90%
of the word.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And my health, of course
your health-- Grandmother's

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:06.690 align:middle line:84%
always say, aw, as long
as you've got your health.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:07.795 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

00:27:07.795 --> 00:27:10.374 align:middle line:84%
That's how cliches become
cliches, they're true.

00:27:10.374 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to go into a bit
more of the macro picture

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:84%
because for people
that are looking

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.400 align:middle line:84%
at investments at large, kind
of watching world economies--

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.309 align:middle line:84%
I read a couple of
your interviews.

00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:23.975 align:middle line:84%
I took excerpts out
from here and there.

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: You mean like from--

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From
with other people.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:26.250 align:middle line:90%
And one of the things--

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Like the Indian--

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.385 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --you were.

00:27:27.385 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: That was good.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:29.859 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was a good one.

00:27:29.859 --> 00:27:30.895 align:middle line:90%
And it struck me--

00:27:30.895 --> 00:27:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: From India, not--

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah. --as being kind
of counterintuitive to some

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:90%
of what we would hear here.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want to
bring these topics up

00:27:37.865 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:84%
because they very
much relate to anyone

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
who's watching this
in any country.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things you were
saying is that the nations

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:84%
of the world-- here we're all
global, one world economy,

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.827 align:middle line:84%
and there is a lot of
that going on almost--

00:27:50.827 --> 00:27:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Well, of course.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in certain ways
because of what we've set up.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It's
enforced by the reality

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:90%
of electronic communications.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.441 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: That's the one world.

00:27:58.441 --> 00:27:59.840 align:middle line:90%
But there's tremendous pushback.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.381 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
you're saying here

00:28:01.381 --> 00:28:03.017 align:middle line:84%
is that "the
nations of the world

00:28:03.017 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:84%
are starting to put their
economies," you said the word,

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.812 align:middle line:90%
"in protective boxes."

00:28:06.812 --> 00:28:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Germany is
the classic example.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's talk
about Germany for a moment.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Why did they succeed?

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Because they were the
first one to do it.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they won
World War II when

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.840 align:middle line:84%
it comes down to it,
in a certain sense.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They came out of
the war destroyed,

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:90%
and now they're back.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:21.940 align:middle line:90%
They've been unified.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to look
at things-- and Japan

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.334 align:middle line:90%
didn't do that bad either.

00:28:26.334 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean the best thing to do
is to lose a war to the United

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.259 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:28:29.259 --> 00:28:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Then we help rebuild you, and
then we're in a lot of trouble,

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and then Germany and--
But what do they do?

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:84%
They make a product
that people want to buy.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
happens to the United

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.317 align:middle line:84%
States is because we got
into financial instruments

00:28:43.317 --> 00:28:44.400 align:middle line:90%
as a way of making money--

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.733 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Instead of production.

00:28:45.733 --> 00:28:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: --and
outsourced production.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, what you
were saying is true.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you are
in Saudi Arabia.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Saudi Arabia is planning
for the end of oil.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:01.560 align:middle line:84%
The really smart ones there
are planning for oil to stop.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.275 align:middle line:84%
And so they can be
predicted, if you realize

00:29:04.275 --> 00:29:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that's where
they're coming from.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Each country is not rushing
to embrace the one world.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
All these people who are afraid
of the globalist, one world

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:90%
thing, that's not true.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it,
everybody is out for themself.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:84%
If you don't think
everyone's out for yourself,

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.320 align:middle line:84%
you don't know astrology
and you don't human nature.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So every nation is
out for themselves

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.390 align:middle line:84%
no matter whether
they're in the EU,

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.420 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're in
any kind of alliance.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:90%
They're still out for themself.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.615 align:middle line:84%
So with all the electronic
communications going on,

00:29:38.615 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
figure out, how

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.579 align:middle line:90%
can I leverage this to help me?

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
necessarily thinking,

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.340 align:middle line:84%
how can I leverage
this to help my people?

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they think
they are their people.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And if things go well for
them, it'll trickle down.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.100 align:middle line:84%
We're not the only ones
with trickle down economy.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I hope I'm answering
the question--

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you
are answering--

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: --because
it's a great question.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.338 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You are
answering the question.

00:29:57.338 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take that a
little further because what

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:90%
you said on the heels of that.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:84%
When people are now starting to
analyze a stock, for example,

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and you have to look at where
that stock originates from.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have to
look at that-- well,

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.137 align:middle line:84%
not talk commodities
for a moment--

00:30:14.137 --> 00:30:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: That's why
EFTs are doing so well.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
People realize that
the game is stacked.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.630 align:middle line:10%
So they're going with the EFTs
now, which are like a fund,

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:27.350 align:middle line:10%
but-- they have
grown like 65-- I

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:33.670 align:middle line:10%
think they have $1.3 trillion
dollars in those kind of funds.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
you're saying, when

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.590 align:middle line:84%
you're looking and
evaluating any of this,

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
look more to the country
that is at the base of it.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't look so much to
the stock or even the commodity

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:49.129 align:middle line:84%
so much as the stability of a
given country associated with

00:30:49.129 --> 00:30:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that particular product
you're looking at buying,

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.045 align:middle line:90%
whether it's an EFT--

00:30:52.045 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The political
stability for sure.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It is so totally individual
in terms of-- They

00:30:58.650 --> 00:30:59.982 align:middle line:90%
still do have a chart.

00:30:59.982 --> 00:31:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you really do
want to get into it,

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.560 align:middle line:84%
you probably could get into it,
but there's too many variables

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.370 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:09.160 align:middle line:84%
The stock market used
to be the United States.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:84%
That's where it started, with
people yelling up at a window.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And once you get
into the situation

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.690 align:middle line:84%
where the markets
are opening in Asia,

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.320 align:middle line:84%
the markets are
opening in Europe,

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.939 align:middle line:90%
you're a little too complex.

00:31:23.939 --> 00:31:25.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then what
are you going to do?

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
out-- I read today

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.416 align:middle line:84%
that they're starting to use the
supercomputers to study cancer.

00:31:29.416 --> 00:31:31.420 align:middle line:84%
They've been using
the supercomputers

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.370 align:middle line:84%
to study money since there were
supercomputers because that's

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:38.240 align:middle line:84%
what keeps the supercomputers
funded is money.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.845 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, they put
money ahead of all things.

00:31:41.845 --> 00:31:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what have the
supercomputers guided us

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:44.800 align:middle line:90%
to now?

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They have put us
into program trading, where

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:53.050 align:middle line:84%
they are programmed to--
I think I was saying

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:84%
that Eric Schmidt
or someone at Google

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.320 align:middle line:84%
is going to sell a lot of
his stock, like a billion

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:57.920 align:middle line:90%
or $2 billion.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I have to read this stuff.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.370 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's
very intriguing to me.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.600 align:middle line:90%
It's like a soap opera.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.799 align:middle line:84%
When he sells his
stock, it immediately

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:07.840 align:middle line:84%
made the stock go down,
just the report that he's

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.830 align:middle line:90%
going to do it.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But the computers, if
they see a big move,

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:84%
they swing to hedge
against a big move that's

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.050 align:middle line:84%
going to catch them and
bite them in the butt.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And that can swing--
now they have

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:24.200 align:middle line:90%
brakes on computer trading.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say that,
computer trading has

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.240 align:middle line:84%
been halted because
the computers will

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.030 align:middle line:90%
bring the whole thing down.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
sorcerer's apprentice.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well that's
why we were saying

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.650 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
this conversation

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:41.672 align:middle line:84%
that you can't really use
celestial influences anymore.

00:32:41.672 --> 00:32:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Not like you could.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:84%
It's four years ago
you really had to stop.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.676 align:middle line:90%
It's about four years.

00:32:47.676 --> 00:32:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Because for a while
there it was sill working

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.520 align:middle line:84%
because they were still
getting the bugs out of stuff.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But now-- I know
I'm going to anger

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot of financial
astrologers, but I frankly

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.600 align:middle line:84%
don't care, because I'm more
concerned with the people.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about people who
are putting their savings,

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.060 align:middle line:84%
like the people
that I know who are

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.730 align:middle line:84%
right now broke because they
put their money in Enron.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Like my friend, who I advise
tremendously, and then

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.550 align:middle line:84%
found out that he
lost $4 million

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.050 align:middle line:84%
with-- what's that
crazy guy's name?

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Madoff.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.051 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: --with Bernie Madoff.

00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you'll ask me
if you should go to the john

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't ask me if you
should invest with Madoff.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:84%
He said, I thought
it was a sure thing.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.729 align:middle line:84%
People think this
stuff is a sure thing.

00:33:28.729 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:90%
And there's--

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it sounds good.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: --no such thing.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there
is no such thing.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: No such thing.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Even United States bonds
are not a sure thing.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well let's talk
about that from a historical

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and also a psychic
point of view.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: OK.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.899 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know a lot of
people are running to bonds.

00:33:41.899 --> 00:33:44.399 align:middle line:84%
What about like local municipal
bonds and state bonds, and--

00:33:44.399 --> 00:33:45.773 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well,
there's a company

00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:47.450 align:middle line:84%
called PIMCO that
sells all the bonds.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And they think-- they are so
negative on the United States

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:54.180 align:middle line:84%
economy, I am amazed
anybody buys any bonds.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.990 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
look up PIMCO, P-I-M-C-O,

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and just read what they-- their
analysis of the US economy is

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.680 align:middle line:84%
terrible because they just don't
see it as being sustainable.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:09.550 align:middle line:84%
The quantitative easing, that
the Federal Reserve basically--

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:84%
My name is Monte, so it's the
old three-card shell game,

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.199 align:middle line:84%
you know, I've got
three cards here.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:17.360 align:middle line:84%
That's, basically, what's
going on as a way of kicking

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.270 align:middle line:84%
the can down the road and
not facing the austerity that

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.429 align:middle line:84%
is necessary to keep
the entitlements

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:28.971 align:middle line:84%
and the various crazy spending
from bringing us down.

00:34:28.971 --> 00:34:30.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what are
you looking at then

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:34.889 align:middle line:84%
from a sheerly psychic point of
view in terms of predictions.

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:37.139 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's
say, you're on record

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:40.000 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of predictions
that have gone very well.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.090 align:middle line:84%
I know the Jim Cramer,
his show, "The Street,"

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:90%
they've used your predictions.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: For a couple of years,
until they had new management,

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.886 align:middle line:90%
they did.

00:34:46.886 --> 00:34:48.719 align:middle line:84%
I think someone was
like, we have a psychic?

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.070 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.655 align:middle line:84%
It came creeping up
on them because they--

00:34:52.655 --> 00:34:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you swept away
under the rug out the door.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, they
just said, well sorry.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, at the end they
were really listening to me.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.230 align:middle line:84%
It started out as a joke because
they interviewed me and Amy

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:84%
because Amy is a
fashion designer who

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.230 align:middle line:84%
sells her work for $4,000 to
$5,000 at Bergdorf Goodman,

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and I have my own
shelves at Barnes & Noble

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.270 align:middle line:90%
for all my books.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:10.686 align:middle line:84%
I've done 40-something
books, I've

00:35:10.686 --> 00:35:12.937 align:middle line:84%
sold two million
books in 14 languages.

00:35:12.937 --> 00:35:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So they thought, aw, isn't this
cute, let's do a little story.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
end they said said,

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.060 align:middle line:84%
well, let's do a segment
on your predictions.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And this was before Obama
was beating Hillary.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me
seven questions.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:25.765 align:middle line:90%
I was right, six out of seven.

00:35:25.765 --> 00:35:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So then they
started coming back.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you
go to "The Street"

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and put in Monte
Farber, Monte with an E,

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:84%
you'll see all these videos of
all of the predictions I did.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they really
gauged me and watched me.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.899 align:middle line:84%
And then, by the end, they were
coming with a list of stocks.

00:35:38.899 --> 00:35:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in the office wanted
to know if they should--

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I read about that.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:45.364 align:middle line:84%
And they were rattling them off,
and you were just getting a--

00:35:45.364 --> 00:35:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: I would
said what I saw.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --an intuitive
quick response.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yeah.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.141 align:middle line:84%
My favorite one is
when they said BP.

00:35:50.141 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:90%
I said, big trouble coming.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:84%
When it tumbles out
like that-- and that

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:84%
was before the Event Horizon
blowout, which was so horrible.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.390 align:middle line:84%
You want to be
right as a psychic,

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.900 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes you're right
about horrible things.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people think I'm
excited about the BP blowout,

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:08.119 align:middle line:90%
but I want to be right.

00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Just like everybody wants to
be better at what they do,

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a better
psychic because, as I said,

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:90%
when I'm wrong, it's me.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not the psychic
information that's wrong,

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.724 align:middle line:84%
it's I have not gotten
out of my own way

00:36:19.724 --> 00:36:21.640 align:middle line:84%
to the point where I'm
getting the right info.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.260 align:middle line:84%
The info is-- it's like the
"X Files," it's out there.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well at 80%
we'll still go ahead,

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to try
you on a few things.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:28.220 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Go right ahead.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.103 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'll assume that
you're out of the way.

00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:30.227 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: That's what I do.

00:36:30.227 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of
all, let's look at China

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:36.090 align:middle line:84%
because, of course, the media
is trying to build China

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:40.717 align:middle line:84%
into the bugaboo, you
know, the new boogie man.

00:36:40.717 --> 00:36:41.800 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about what--

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: New kid on the block.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: New kid on the block.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.989 align:middle line:84%
And massive amounts
of wealth tucked away.

00:36:45.989 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: They have our wealth.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And our
wealth tucked away.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: We sent it
them to manufacture.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And metals,
lots of gold and so forth.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:57.520 align:middle line:84%
But what's really going on with
China from your point of view?

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They have
tremendous problems.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:84%
They are holding
on-- I mean, they

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:84%
have 150 million people
as itinerant workers.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.879 align:middle line:84%
That's 150 million
people, that's

00:37:09.879 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:84%
almost half the population
of the United States, that's

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.370 align:middle line:90%
on the move looking for work.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why when
holidays come-- they

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.014 align:middle line:84%
have these big holidays
where you're supposed

00:37:18.014 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
to honor your relatives-- they
have trains and disasters.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's riots
all over the place

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
lot of corruption.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:26.530 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot of problems.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
their military is not

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.680 align:middle line:84%
growing leaps and bounds, and
doing all the other stuff.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But I think they
are taking care--

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.249 align:middle line:84%
they are making
their base secure.

00:37:37.249 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're making
their base secure,

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.902 align:middle line:90%
but they also own lot of us.

00:37:40.902 --> 00:37:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They own a lot
of our debt, for sure.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's what I mean.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And at a
certain point you

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:46.510 align:middle line:84%
want to go over to the people
that owe you a lot of money

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and say, you know, you
guys better straighten out.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
that they're going

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.720 align:middle line:84%
to attack us or
anything like that,

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.670 align:middle line:84%
but they have every
right to complain

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.560 align:middle line:90%
if they don't get paid back.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones who
have a lot of our bonds,

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.750 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of our debt.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.640 align:middle line:90%
And they have a lot of our cash.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And when the dollar
goes down, of course, we

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:05.900 align:middle line:84%
don't notice it that much
because I'm giving you dollars

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:90%
and you're giving me dollars.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.700 align:middle line:84%
They notice it a lot
because all of a sudden,

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.490 align:middle line:84%
well, we have a
trillion dollars and it

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:90%
buys half of what it bought.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden--
half is definitely not

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.610 align:middle line:84%
the right number, but that gives
you the idea-- all of a sudden

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:20.700 align:middle line:90%
they are upset.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't be surprised
if they were making moves

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to make the renminbi,
or whatever it's called,

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.910 align:middle line:84%
the world currency, or
changing the world currency,

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:35.520 align:middle line:84%
or changing the
whole world finances.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.399 align:middle line:84%
If they see that
they could do it,

00:38:37.399 --> 00:38:39.940 align:middle line:84%
they'll do it because they don't
have the constraints that we

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:44.660 align:middle line:84%
do with democracy or a
republic, a democratic republic.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:48.690 align:middle line:84%
If they see a way where--
I know that there's

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:51.222 align:middle line:84%
talk about making a different
global currency for oil

00:38:51.222 --> 00:38:53.680 align:middle line:84%
purchases where there's going
to be a basket of currencies,

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So the way I work as
a psychic, let's say

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:01.637 align:middle line:84%
you wanted to invest in an
oil or an individual EFT

00:39:01.637 --> 00:39:03.220 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that, you would then

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.928 align:middle line:84%
come to me as a psychic,
I would tell you

00:39:04.928 --> 00:39:06.470 align:middle line:84%
what I got about
the whole thing,

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.730 align:middle line:84%
because, as our
conversation reveals,

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:12.440 align:middle line:84%
it's a very complex
financial world.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think anyone
who makes money now

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:19.290 align:middle line:84%
has to break it into a very
small manageable little piece

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:22.415 align:middle line:84%
of jerky off of the big piece
of jerky, or else nothing.

00:39:22.415 --> 00:39:23.290 align:middle line:90%
You can't swallow it.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.485 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: So they have their
own internal problems in China.

00:39:25.485 --> 00:39:26.276 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Big time.

00:39:26.276 --> 00:39:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They need to almost
do this strange little dance

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.740 align:middle line:84%
with us, even though
we're indebted to them.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: They do.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
can't really afford

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.946 align:middle line:90%
to see the Western world slide.

00:39:35.946 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They can't, but at the
same time, they're very upset.

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And they are sort
of encircling us.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they own the docks,
the ports that the others--

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.030 align:middle line:90%
both sides of the Panama Canal.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.690 align:middle line:84%
The United States,
under Carter, sold

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:84%
the-- got rid of the Panama
Canal, gave it back to Panama.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.870 align:middle line:84%
China is all over the world
looking for resources, oil

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:54.464 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:39:54.464 --> 00:39:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Precious minerals.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.509 align:middle line:90%
metals, all of it.

00:39:56.509 --> 00:39:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: The earth met--

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
the earth metals.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, precious earth minerals.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.921 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The ones that are used
for like cell phones and all

00:40:02.921 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:90%
that stuff.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.020 align:middle line:90%
The rare earth minerals.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.130 align:middle line:90%
We now import them.

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.700 align:middle line:84%
The United States has
not made its base secure.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:14.840 align:middle line:84%
It is buying military equipment
from outside the United States.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.899 align:middle line:84%
We can go on for days
about this stuff.

00:40:16.899 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.002 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you about India.

00:40:19.002 --> 00:40:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll get around to
the US toward the end.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.920 align:middle line:90%
What about India?

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Big problems also.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Tremendous problems.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Their caste system is
a tremendous problem,

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and I mean that economically,
because with all the focusing

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.200 align:middle line:84%
we're doing on finances I never
lose sight of the spiritual.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Without love you're
nothing but sounding brass,

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.840 align:middle line:90%
it says in the Bible.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have
a society that's

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:47.340 align:middle line:84%
caste system'd like that and
expect it to succeed because it

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.920 align:middle line:90%
goes in the face of love.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And love is really-- love
and greed and fear-- I mean,

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:54.220 align:middle line:90%
those are the big ones.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The big commodities.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Exactly.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And when someone comes
to me to ask a question,

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:02.010 align:middle line:84%
usually the first question,
if they're not paying me,

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:03.386 align:middle line:90%
is about love.

00:41:03.386 --> 00:41:05.010 align:middle line:84%
If they're paying
me, it's about money.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And in New York, a lot of
it is about will I ever find

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.190 align:middle line:90%
an apartment or stuff like that.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:15.070 align:middle line:84%
But look, if India's problems,
besides the population,

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.890 align:middle line:84%
is the caste system
because it eats away

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:21.170 align:middle line:90%
at the soul of the country.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And I actually, when I'm
doing it psychically,

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.070 align:middle line:84%
it's pure, I don't know
where it's coming from.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about armies
or anything like that.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But when I try and understand
why I'm getting the information

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.174 align:middle line:84%
about India, it seems to always
come back to that they don't--

00:41:37.174 --> 00:41:39.173 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until that part
is healed and evolved.

00:41:39.173 --> 00:41:41.675 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: --like
their own people.

00:41:41.675 --> 00:41:43.800 align:middle line:84%
They have people that
they're calling untouchables.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.594 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: I mean, to us, those
are the gangster fighters.

00:41:47.594 --> 00:41:48.510 align:middle line:90%
They're just horrible.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, too many
disenfranchised individuals

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.740 align:middle line:84%
in India to really holistically
grow the economy where

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.990 align:middle line:84%
they would like to
go even, or to be

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.380 align:middle line:90%
a really prominent player?

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They are
a prominent player,

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.150 align:middle line:84%
but they will undermine
themselves as a nation

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.320 align:middle line:90%
unless they clean up.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, right now there's all
those rape stories coming out

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.330 align:middle line:90%
of India, which is disgusting.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.420 align:middle line:84%
That's a big-- see, I always
thought that the problems that

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.600 align:middle line:84%
occur in the world
are because men

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and women, in their individual
experiences, are not--

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and partnerships in general,
not just men and woman.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't want be a sexist.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:84%
If you can't keep things
straight at home, it goes out.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And in that country
they obviously

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:36.230 align:middle line:84%
have big, big problems because
of-- I mean, talk about racism.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.770 align:middle line:84%
When you call
people untouchables.

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I understand.

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:43.285 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: But in terms of--
India is just starting,

00:42:43.285 --> 00:42:45.660 align:middle line:84%
they're just waking up, but
they have tremendous problems

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.370 align:middle line:90%
with Pakistan.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Pakistan has nuclear weapons,
India has nuclear weapons.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.450 align:middle line:84%
There's the problems
with Kashmir.

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.533 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask me psychically,
I'll just tell you,

00:42:55.533 --> 00:42:57.241 align:middle line:84%
should you invest in
this stock in India,

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.380 align:middle line:90%
and I'll say yes or no.

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone should go
to their psychic development

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.410 align:middle line:84%
because there's no way to
know intellectually now.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I totally
agree with that.

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.920 align:middle line:84%
We're on our own when
it comes to trying

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.055 align:middle line:84%
to understand and contend
with the world, not just

00:43:12.055 --> 00:43:14.090 align:middle line:84%
the economy, but
the world at large.

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:16.614 align:middle line:84%
We really need to invest in
our own psychic development.

00:43:16.614 --> 00:43:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I really think so.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.210 align:middle line:84%
That's why I try and-- I'm
a big do-it-yourselfer.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:23.460 align:middle line:84%
All of my books-- I mean,
I wasn't born psychic.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.525 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize I was.

00:43:24.525 --> 00:43:26.070 align:middle line:90%
I must have been a little bit.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But from 1988, when my first
book, "Karma Cards," came out,

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.462 align:middle line:90%
I've been writing these books.

00:43:31.462 --> 00:43:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And all these books
I would say, and this

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.922 align:middle line:84%
will improve your
intuition, and it did.

00:43:35.922 --> 00:43:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And writing the books,
and using all the things

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.650 align:middle line:84%
that I do has improved
my intuition to the point

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:44.000 align:middle line:84%
where when, unfortunately, when
my mother-in-law passed away,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.500 align:middle line:84%
we missed her so much-- she
was a wonderful person-- when

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.300 align:middle line:84%
she passed away I
wanted to reach her.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.020 align:middle line:90%
And I tried and I was able to.

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.936 align:middle line:84%
And then I started doing
readings for friends,

00:43:53.936 --> 00:43:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and I started getting
this amazing stuff.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.410 align:middle line:84%
The information we got
about Amy's mother,

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:58.680 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know if
it was right or not,

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.250 align:middle line:84%
but Amy's grandmother
was still alive

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and we asked her and she was
like, how did you know that?

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So I knew there was
something to it.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And so if I can develop
psychic ability,

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.060 align:middle line:84%
anyone can develop
psychic ability

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.060 align:middle line:90%
If they do it with love.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got to care
about the people you read for.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.386 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you can't
be sitting there going well

00:44:16.386 --> 00:44:18.415 align:middle line:84%
this person has 50
cars and an airplane,

00:44:18.415 --> 00:44:21.946 align:middle line:84%
and-- that doesn't work
because you'll never get it

00:44:21.946 --> 00:44:23.320 align:middle line:84%
if you think that
way about them.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.069 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:25.064 align:middle line:90%
And about yourself.

00:44:25.064 --> 00:44:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And so what we'll
talk about that.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask about the United
States because in an odd way,

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.370 align:middle line:84%
you have a little bit of
a kind of bullish attitude

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.880 align:middle line:90%
about the American economy.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:34.838 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Very much so.

00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why is that when all
these other pieces of evidence

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.210 align:middle line:84%
would indicate it's
just a house of cards?

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, because
I'm doing readings

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.770 align:middle line:84%
for these people of
all stages, people

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:50.250 align:middle line:84%
who are managers and
CEOs, and they're smart.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's running for
shelter in their own manner.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And just the way
the untouchables

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and the caste system eats away
at the fabric of that society,

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:03.490 align:middle line:84%
the fact that America was
founded by rugged individuals--

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and that is the paradigm
of this nation, is I

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.710 align:middle line:90%
am going to be an individual.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:13.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's this
dichotomy coming to the country

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:13.810 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Because every time
they try and pass

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.410 align:middle line:84%
a law that makes
people less able to be

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:20.420 align:middle line:84%
the rugged individual,
or less able to relate

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.410 align:middle line:84%
to the founding fathers,
and the minutemen,

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.970 align:middle line:90%
and I'll save you now.

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:27.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like Dudley Do-Right.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.680 align:middle line:84%
The people of this country--
it's just like many years ago.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Remember when Japan
was on the ascendancy?

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:33.294 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:33.294 --> 00:45:35.001 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And they
were coming over here.

00:45:35.001 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:84%
They bought Sony,
they bought all this--

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.150 align:middle line:90%
All this real estate.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:38.483 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: --other kind of stuff.

00:45:38.483 --> 00:45:40.300 align:middle line:84%
A few years later,
they don't have it

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:44.670 align:middle line:84%
because American people--
and the British people

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:45.510 align:middle line:90%
are smart too.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:46.430 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is smart.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that we
have some monopoly on it.

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
United States, the model

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:55.562 align:middle line:84%
exists for I will
protect you, Nell.

00:45:55.562 --> 00:45:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Even though that's-- Dudley
Do-Right is a Canadian mountie,

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:84%
so that's, I guess,
not the best example.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But, the people that I know with
a lot of money, they're taking,

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:08.124 align:middle line:84%
they're taking stock and
they're making moves now.

00:46:08.124 --> 00:46:09.790 align:middle line:84%
After the election
they're making moves.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, because
a lot of the people

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.416 align:middle line:84%
that I read for go to
that Herb Allen thing.

00:46:15.416 --> 00:46:19.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Allen & Company
is a big investment bank.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And they do something in,
I think it's Sun Valley,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Idaho, where they fly
the creme de la creme.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yes, I remember.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.380 align:middle line:90%
That was recently.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well they
do it every year.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.290 align:middle line:90%
They came in recently, yeah.

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Before 2008
they knew it was coming.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, the people that I
talked to knew it was coming.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I was warned by a
few different people.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And I didn't
believe it intellectually.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But they said-- I got calls
from different people-- saying

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.029 align:middle line:84%
everyone here is scared,
what should I do?

00:46:46.029 --> 00:46:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
are they doing now?

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.370 align:middle line:84%
What are they doing that
would make you feel--

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.105 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They're buying a
lot of things in New Zealand,

00:46:51.105 --> 00:46:51.929 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you that.

00:46:51.929 --> 00:46:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The land
that produces food

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.200 align:middle line:90%
is being bought tremendously.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.825 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now what about that in
general, even in this country.

00:46:57.825 --> 00:47:00.135 align:middle line:84%
If you're an individual and
you have a little money,

00:47:00.135 --> 00:47:00.760 align:middle line:90%
and you could--

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They're putting
it into food producing

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.110 align:middle line:84%
land, commodities because, once
again, commodities are still--

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:10.157 align:middle line:84%
the game is not so
rigged with commodities.

00:47:10.157 --> 00:47:11.740 align:middle line:84%
As I said before,
they're very worried

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.752 align:middle line:84%
about the leadership
of this country.

00:47:13.752 --> 00:47:15.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are
renouncing citizenship,

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.250 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
moving to Switzerland

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:20.732 align:middle line:84%
because Switzerland's
banking laws are changing.

00:47:20.732 --> 00:47:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how is that
going to help the US?

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Your very wealthy friends
moving to Switzerland,

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.060 align:middle line:84%
how is that helping
the US economy?

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Because this
is where they play.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.659 align:middle line:90%
That's where they live.

00:47:30.659 --> 00:47:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Because
the United States

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.246 align:middle line:84%
economy is still free enough
where you can do stuff.

00:47:34.246 --> 00:47:38.310 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the countries,
the laws are so stacked.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:40.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of countries,
you can't own the land.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.540 align:middle line:90%
The government owns the land.

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:46.157 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, in the United States,
like a state like Pennsylvania,

00:47:46.157 --> 00:47:47.990 align:middle line:84%
you can own the mineral
rights, someone else

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:50.480 align:middle line:84%
can own the surface rights,
the state doesn't own anything.

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.396 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to some
of the African countries

00:47:52.396 --> 00:47:53.870 align:middle line:84%
or some of the
other countries, you

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:57.390 align:middle line:84%
have to play with the government
because they own everything.

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's one, that
area of freedom.

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:01.163 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And plus,
the United States

00:48:01.163 --> 00:48:03.680 align:middle line:84%
is going to do the-- I'm
sure you talk about here--

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.080 align:middle line:84%
the energy stuff
is going to change.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Just like we invented,
not inv-- like Al Gore

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.212 align:middle line:90%
invented the internet.

00:48:12.212 --> 00:48:13.753 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
innovation comes out

00:48:13.753 --> 00:48:16.480 align:middle line:84%
of the United States because
of our national character,

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.850 align:middle line:90%
and the people that come here.

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:21.210 align:middle line:84%
People always have to remember
that the people who've

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:23.168 align:middle line:84%
come to the United States
are either thrown out

00:48:23.168 --> 00:48:26.050 align:middle line:84%
of somewhere else, or we are the
nation of everyone who says--

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or trying to
escape something else.

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Escape, or we
are the people who said,

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:30.950 align:middle line:90%
this is-- I hate this place.

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:31.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go do something
because they're not

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.622 align:middle line:90%
letting me do what I want to do.

00:48:34.622 --> 00:48:35.830 align:middle line:90%
So you have a nation of this.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Our cellular
consciousness is a nation

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.140 align:middle line:84%
of people who
thrive on adversity.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.000 align:middle line:90%
So maybe--

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And creativity.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:43.801 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: And create-- exactly.

00:48:43.801 --> 00:48:45.796 align:middle line:84%
And creativity is
spirituality to many.

00:48:45.796 --> 00:48:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you know,
because for years I've

00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:51.530 align:middle line:84%
been saying the same thing
in that my feeling was

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:54.504 align:middle line:84%
because of that same spirit
you're talking about,

00:48:54.504 --> 00:48:56.920 align:middle line:84%
which I thought would have
really been pushed sooner this.

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, I'm surprised
it's taking us

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.640 align:middle line:84%
this long as a
nation to wake up.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.315 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things have
gotten pretty bad.

00:49:02.315 --> 00:49:02.898 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes,

00:49:02.898 --> 00:49:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But nonetheless,
as you say, embedded within

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:11.170 align:middle line:84%
us is this rebellious,
very personally-- needing

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to have that personal
recognition, and freedom,

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.079 align:middle line:90%
and sovereignty.

00:49:15.079 --> 00:49:16.620 align:middle line:84%
That very thing that
I've been seeing

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.300 align:middle line:84%
was going to be the
hallmark that would take us

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.110 align:middle line:84%
through these times is the
same thing you're seeing.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: You're seeing.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I do see it.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.436 align:middle line:90%
I mean I get excited.

00:49:24.436 --> 00:49:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Intellectually I feel that.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.260 align:middle line:90%
In my heart I feel that.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.510 align:middle line:90%
But I also see it psychically.

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Because when I ask about
investments and things

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.760 align:middle line:84%
in this country, even though I
go on about how bonds are not

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.090 align:middle line:84%
100% safe, when I ask, is
the dollar a safe investment?

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes it is.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.190 align:middle line:84%
If I ask is the Federal
Reserve going to be destroyed?

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.750 align:middle line:90%
No it's not.

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:45.150 align:middle line:90%
You have too big to fail--

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:46.493 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How many people
would pray for that one?

00:49:46.493 --> 00:49:47.201 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I know.

00:49:47.201 --> 00:49:49.885 align:middle line:84%
But you have too big to fail,
you have too evil to fail also.

00:49:49.885 --> 00:49:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
too evil to fail.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: People
have to be real,

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.810 align:middle line:84%
because if you're not being
real about what's going on,

00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:58.260 align:middle line:84%
you are going to
delude yourself.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole thing about
getting out of your own way

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:02.120 align:middle line:90%
is yeah, I feel that way.

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, who cares what I feel?

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.989 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what the
Akashic record has to say.

00:50:05.989 --> 00:50:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
the spirits has to say,

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:11.120 align:middle line:84%
what my mother-in-law has to
say, or my father, or whatever.

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.630 align:middle line:84%
We all have to learn to
listen to our intuition purely

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and, as Huxley
said, I'm too much

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.070 align:middle line:84%
a skeptic not to believe
anything's possible.

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:19.736 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:19.736 --> 00:50:20.280 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:24.040 align:middle line:84%
When you do psychic readings,
one of the hardest things

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.140 align:middle line:84%
is because you have
to say what you get.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.705 align:middle line:84%
If you see something silly,
you still have to say it.

00:50:28.705 --> 00:50:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.400 align:middle line:84%
OK Let's talk about a
couple of commodities,

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:34.407 align:middle line:84%
the ones that with other
people I interview, and I

00:50:34.407 --> 00:50:34.990 align:middle line:90%
read various--

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Gold.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:35.985 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Newsletters and such.

00:50:35.985 --> 00:50:37.319 align:middle line:90%
Yeah That's it, you've got it.

00:50:37.319 --> 00:50:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Talking
about the Anunnaki.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's not
talk about the Anunnaki part,

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's just talk--

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: The whole
thing with gold.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.431 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I get it.

00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:44.190 align:middle line:90%
The gold things.

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Goldfinger.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's going to happen
with gold, and what do you see?

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:48.483 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It's going
to probably go to 3000.

00:50:48.483 --> 00:50:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 3000.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.720 align:middle line:84%
That's consistent with what
some of the other players

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:52.804 align:middle line:90%
in that market are saying.

00:50:52.804 --> 00:50:54.803 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing it from
a psychic perspective.

00:50:54.803 --> 00:50:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
also happening--

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: But it
won't be right away.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:02.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't even think that
might be until like 2015.

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:03.121 align:middle line:90%
But it's going to go.

00:51:03.121 --> 00:51:04.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not going down,
let's put it --

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.780 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
go back to 200.

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they say
it's been manipulated

00:51:07.696 --> 00:51:09.650 align:middle line:84%
to even keep it at
this rate between what?

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:11.619 align:middle line:84%
1650 and 1750,
for months on end.

00:51:11.619 --> 00:51:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Because it
was going up too fast.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And, well, Putin
just bought what?

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.730 align:middle line:90%
570 metric tons of gold?

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:21.737 align:middle line:84%
And other countries have
begun repatriating their gold.

00:51:21.737 --> 00:51:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Yes.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
calling it back in.

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well,
that could happen.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It happened in
the United States.

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:25.453 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:25.453 --> 00:51:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: When gold
was $35 an ounce,

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.920 align:middle line:90%
the government called it.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.880 align:middle line:84%
See, this is-- when people
say, oh, the government

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.550 align:middle line:90%
won't do this.

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:31.950 align:middle line:90%
They will do some things.

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:33.710 align:middle line:90%
And I-- Will they call in gold?

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:35.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so at this point.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.950 align:middle line:90%
But, that's what I get now.

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:39.560 align:middle line:90%
What happens if--

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Things change.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.919 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Because the
future is-- people

00:51:42.919 --> 00:51:44.710 align:middle line:84%
don't remember what
phonograph records are.

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But a phonograph
record was a needle

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.010 align:middle line:84%
in a groove on a circle,
that went around.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And the way it works is the
present moment is the needle,

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:55.734 align:middle line:84%
and there's a million
potential grooves going out.

00:51:55.734 --> 00:51:58.150 align:middle line:10%
When I do a psychic reading,
I'm reading the most probable

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:01.530 align:middle line:10%
future-- that's
also quantum physics

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:02.980 align:middle line:10%
is the probable futures.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.700 align:middle line:90%
And that can change.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.089 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to cop out,
and I'm usually pretty right,

00:52:07.089 --> 00:52:08.130 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not always right.

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, reality is
whatever is in a state of flux

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.020 align:middle line:84%
by the nanosecond,
that's reality.

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Any thought, any
event, anything can

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:17.870 align:middle line:90%
interject itself to change it.

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:20.507 align:middle line:84%
But from what you're
seeing, as a general trend,

00:52:20.507 --> 00:52:21.840 align:middle line:90%
so gold looks like that that's--

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Gold is
a solid investment.

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:--is going
continue going up?

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:23.937 align:middle line:90%
What about silver?

00:52:23.937 --> 00:52:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Does that go right alongside it?

00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: It does.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what other--

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: What is it?

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.610 align:middle line:90%
It's like it's 40-something now.

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it's, I
think it's like 31-ish,

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:30.370 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well
then I just saw 41.

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unless it
changed in the last day.

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.930 align:middle line:84%
You just saw 41, so
it could go back up.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I just saw 41.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.415 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
going to go back.

00:52:36.415 --> 00:52:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.358 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: That, I think,
is going to be sooner.

00:52:39.358 --> 00:52:40.460 align:middle line:90%
That might be by July.

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.596 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, interesting.

00:52:41.596 --> 00:52:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Is it OK
to date the program?

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, sure.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.201 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: OK.

00:52:45.201 --> 00:52:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're talking July 2013.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So it could go as
high as 41 by then.

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It might even
go higher than that.

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Let me put it to you that way.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.699 align:middle line:84%
I feel very comfortable saying
July of this year for 41.

00:52:57.699 --> 00:52:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And what about, I mean in
general, the rare earth

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.360 align:middle line:84%
minerals we're talking about,
of which the Chinese own

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.120 align:middle line:90%
a huge percentage of them.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.044 align:middle line:84%
That's not really that
practical for people

00:53:08.044 --> 00:53:09.460 align:middle line:84%
to try to buy into
as individuals.

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: That's really hard.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.462 align:middle line:84%
I guess you'd have to do
an EFT to-- I don't even

00:53:13.462 --> 00:53:14.300 align:middle line:90%
know how you'd trade in that.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in general,
do you see the up, up,

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.110 align:middle line:84%
up because of the
rise in technology?

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: I do
think that there's

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.190 align:middle line:84%
going to be a reaction
to the sequestration,

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:27.630 align:middle line:84%
and the armaments--
Right now there's

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:29.830 align:middle line:84%
tremendous threat to the
United States military

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:32.110 align:middle line:84%
by the sequestration because
of the budget ceiling,

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:33.110 align:middle line:90%
and all the other stuff.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.177 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to
start making budget cuts.

00:53:35.177 --> 00:53:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And usually when
they make budget cuts

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.590 align:middle line:84%
to the army and navy
there's tremendous backlash.

00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:43.480 align:middle line:84%
I think the pushback is going
to bring a lot of manufacturing

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:45.870 align:middle line:84%
back to the United States
because I think they are going

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to see that we cannot buy rare
earth minerals from China.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.730 align:middle line:90%
We just can't.

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Talk about a no-brainer.

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
there is going to be

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:01.070 align:middle line:84%
a lot of military manufacturing
brought back to the United

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:02.770 align:middle line:84%
States for parts
and stuff like that.

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.603 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
manufacturing at large?

00:54:04.603 --> 00:54:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm starting
to see now-- you'll

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.800 align:middle line:84%
see an advertisement for a
clothing line, proudly made

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.547 align:middle line:90%
in the US.

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.255 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Well,--

00:54:11.255 --> 00:54:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Has it changed?

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:13.093 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: What has
happened is there's

00:54:13.093 --> 00:54:16.186 align:middle line:84%
been a leveling-- People
are willing to work for less

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:17.810 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
and people are not

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:19.726 align:middle line:84%
willing to work for less
than other countries,

00:54:19.726 --> 00:54:21.871 align:middle line:84%
because wages have
risen in China.

00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So the people who used to invest
in China now go to Vietnam.

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that's
going to come up too.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, there is
this global economy--

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:32.639 align:middle line:84%
there's another country that
lost the war to the United

00:54:32.639 --> 00:54:34.680 align:middle line:84%
States, sort of, kind of,
but didn't really lose,

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.830 align:middle line:84%
but won, but lost,
but got destroyed,

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:37.950 align:middle line:90%
but made a lot of money.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And now everyone goes
to Vietnam for vacation.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
manufacturing going on there.

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:46.390 align:middle line:84%
People in this country are
willing to work for less.

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And people in those countries
don't want to work for less.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.836 align:middle line:90%
It's a leveling.

00:54:50.836 --> 00:54:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
see a resurgence

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:53.210 align:middle line:90%
in the United States?

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Of manufacturing.

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
about in Europe?

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.670 align:middle line:84%
What do you see happening
in the Eurozone?

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: I worry about Europe.

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:00.770 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the economy there,
I don't see movement there.

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Because I always
see it as stagnant.

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I did think, and, yes, I
still think-- I had to ask,

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:08.740 align:middle line:90%
do I still think?

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I do think that the
euro's going to go down.

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.450 align:middle line:90%
I just think it's a mistake.

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it was something
that was tried,

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
it's gonna stay.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And that will be
very destabilizing

00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:21.750 align:middle line:84%
for the world economy for
about seven or eight months.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:24.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think the smart
money will see it coming.

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard anything
about it from my people

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:29.610 align:middle line:84%
because, what we were talking
about before with program

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:30.297 align:middle line:90%
trading.

00:55:30.297 --> 00:55:32.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who didn't want
to do commodities because they

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.671 align:middle line:84%
don't want to get
involved with that stuff,

00:55:34.671 --> 00:55:37.740 align:middle line:84%
they trade money now
because they're smart enough

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:39.545 align:middle line:84%
to see the macro,
like you were saying,

00:55:39.545 --> 00:55:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and that you can make
money trading the money.

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're very against
the one world economy

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.870 align:middle line:84%
because then there will
be no money trading.

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And on
that note, when you

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:51.010 align:middle line:84%
look at it, again, from an
even larger perspective,

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:54.022 align:middle line:84%
and you add a spiritual
perspective in there,

00:55:54.022 --> 00:55:58.590 align:middle line:84%
there are certain-- Well, the
Theo Group, for example, that

00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:02.030 align:middle line:84%
is channeled by Sheila Gillette,
and some others as well,

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:05.390 align:middle line:84%
have seen, if you look into the
future of the human species,

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:07.930 align:middle line:84%
we do move toward a one
world government and economy.

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But what they've said, not with
the psychology of usuriousness,

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and exploitation, and
greed that exists now.

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So it really almost has
to be an evolutionary leap

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:23.130 align:middle line:84%
within our own
spiritual development

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:26.415 align:middle line:84%
that could even allow a one
world economy to happen,

00:56:26.415 --> 00:56:28.130 align:middle line:90%
it sounds like.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: When you say
that, it sounds wonderful,

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm trying to apply
it to the people that I know.

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
going to happen.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: You see these
TV shows and someone says,

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:40.310 align:middle line:90%
not on my watch.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Actually that's so
strongly psychically.

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:44.230 align:middle line:84%
They're not gonna
let that happen.

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.229 align:middle line:84%
They want their
kids to be wealthy.

00:56:46.229 --> 00:56:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I get that.

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
happen because it

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.830 align:middle line:84%
would take a spiritual
leap of growth.

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It would have to
take a level of acceptance of I

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:57.100 align:middle line:90%
don't need that much.

00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.840 align:middle line:10%
I have met wealthy
people who say,

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.020 align:middle line:10%
I only can put on one
pair of pants a day,

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:02.480 align:middle line:10%
I can only eat
one chicken a day,

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.370 align:middle line:10%
and I can only drive
one car at a time.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:06.670 align:middle line:10%
They are few and far between.

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:08.882 align:middle line:10%
Most of them want
this incredible level.

00:57:08.882 --> 00:57:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
something's happening

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:11.506 align:middle line:90%
with the younger generation.

00:57:11.506 --> 00:57:14.011 align:middle line:84%
And I've brought this
up in other interviews.

00:57:14.011 --> 00:57:15.760 align:middle line:84%
They know how to share
in a different way.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:20.750 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of the
indigos, or the more evolved--

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and even their DNA is
coming in differently

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:27.080 align:middle line:84%
in some cases-- beings that are
coming with a different mass

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.122 align:middle line:90%
psychology.

00:57:28.122 --> 00:57:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they're
the ones that are

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:32.630 align:middle line:84%
going to carry forward more
even back to more agrarian

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:middle line:84%
kind of lifestyle and
communal lifestyle.

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: Well, they are
buying land for food.

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: They need
someone to work it.

00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:39.220 align:middle line:84%
You can't do work it
all with machines.

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.595 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and
you see fellows

00:57:40.595 --> 00:57:42.140 align:middle line:84%
with cute little
earrings, you know,

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:43.770 align:middle line:84%
they're goats, and
their degrees that

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:46.129 align:middle line:84%
are doing microgreen
gardening and such.

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And you can make
money doing stuff like that.

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Well maybe, the children
that the people I

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.060 align:middle line:84%
know, when they inherit
the money, they'll

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.680 align:middle line:90%
be more equitable with it.

00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:00.690 align:middle line:84%
That might be the way
it happens is that,

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.650 align:middle line:84%
what my nephew-- because we live
out in the Hamptons-- and he

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:07.270 align:middle line:84%
used to call his friends who
are wealthy the trustafarians.

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:10.032 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the trustafarians,
when they get their money,

00:58:10.032 --> 00:58:11.990 align:middle line:84%
they'll be more generous
and they'll try and do

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:14.450 align:middle line:84%
things that create jobs for
all these people like your son,

00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:15.800 align:middle line:90%
you were saying.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:20.670 align:middle line:84%
There are so many people who are
having a hard time getting by.

00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But I do feel hopeful, and I
do feel bullish on America.

00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's just
my growing up in the '60s

00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:31.230 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- now
I'm in my 60s--

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:36.470 align:middle line:84%
but I do feel that the world
is evolving and not devolving.

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And so for the rest of us,
again, back to the basics,

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:43.410 align:middle line:84%
be honest about what
we truly desire,

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:46.790 align:middle line:84%
try to manifest from
that point of view.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Back to the land,
making sure that we

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.130 align:middle line:90%
can grow a little bit of food.

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:53.810 align:middle line:84%
The real basics are what
matter again, right?

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: And if you're going
to a affirm something, affirm

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:57.850 align:middle line:84%
things that are
within your grasp

00:58:57.850 --> 00:58:59.390 align:middle line:84%
because if you
don't, you'll always

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:01.910 align:middle line:84%
be depressed because
you won't attain them.

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you start your
affirmations logically,

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:07.015 align:middle line:84%
I want my bills paid, I want
a job that pays a decent wage

00:59:07.015 --> 00:59:09.400 align:middle line:84%
and that I enjoy with
people that I like,

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:11.980 align:middle line:84%
these are not too many
things to ask for.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Then you can get it,
and then you can do it.

00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is universal.

00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:16.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to look
to the stars for that.

00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:20.192 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It works in every
language, and every philosophy.

00:59:20.192 --> 00:59:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Monte,
thank you so much.

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FARBER: Oh, thank you.

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.426 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to continue.

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And for an even fuller
history of astrology

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and why it does work,
even though it's not

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:29.880 align:middle line:84%
working in these rigged
markets right now--

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FARBER: It's a great
psychological language.

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you're going
to want to join us.

00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:34.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have another
conversation, and that

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:36.440 align:middle line:84%
delves deep into the
history of Earth,

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:38.398 align:middle line:84%
according to Monte's
friend, who you mentioned,

00:59:38.398 --> 00:59:39.560 align:middle line:90%
Zecharia Sitchin.

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.980 align:middle line:84%
This brings in evidence
for the use of astrology

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:45.500 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times, the 12th
planet, and much more.

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
