00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:21.270 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Perhaps the
most frustrating issue for many

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.450 align:middle line:10%
of us in this exciting time
of bringing the unseen world

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:10%
into our known reality is
that we can't show proof,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:10%
but not any longer.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Gary Schwartz has done more
than almost any other individual

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:84%
in the field of
medicine and psychology

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:84%
to prove that we and
the world around us

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.770 align:middle line:90%
is a plenum of consciousness.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Today, he's the chief researcher
for Focused Life-Force Energy,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:84%
a technology that lifts the
consciousness of any field it's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
applied to, kind of
like a little miracle.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.735 align:middle line:84%
It's good to see you again
after all these years.

00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> GARY SCHWARTZ:
Wonderful to see you again.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How long since we
sat across from each other?

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Probably several years
now, I think, has it been?

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: At least.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I love the turn
that your career has taken.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've known you for
probably close to 20 years,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:84%
from New Mexico and the science
and spirituality conferences,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and watched some of the
projects you've been through.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with one of
the sexy, juicy ones everybody

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:90%
loves.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
You were working with
the study of telepathy,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.473 align:middle line:84%
doing research in the
area of telepathy.

00:01:22.473 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
how that happened

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and how you became
interested in these unseen

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:84%
fields of consciousness
and trying to prove they

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:90%
exist to begin with.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:10%
>> SCHWARTZ: I think my work in
the mediumship area and survival

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness actually
began when I was at Yale.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
But it was secret, because
it was stimulated by theory.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was stimulated
by an analysis

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:84%
of how information in
a system circulated

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and how feedback created
self-awareness, awareness

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:90%
of self.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And that that awareness,
that feedback,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
continued in the
expanding space.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
Just as we look up at the sky
at night and we see a history

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:84%
of starlight, we see starlight
that's been traveling

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:84%
for millions and
billions of years,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and long after those
stars have, quote, "died,"

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:84%
that energy and
information is still there.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a history
of all that starlight

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:84%
through these tiny little
things we call eyes.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And it became clear to
me that the possibility

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that our energy and
our consciousness

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:84%
could continue like the
light from distant stars

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:84%
became almost, if you
would, a required prediction

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:90%
from then-accepted physics.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what opened me
to the idea of survival

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I began
to meet mediums.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And they, in ever more carefully
controlled experiments,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
convinced me that what
they were doing was real

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and that they were actually able
to receive information, accurate

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
information, not by reading
the mind of the sitter,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
but by actually connecting with
their loved ones who were just

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:90%
as alive--

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Accessing the field.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: --and
accessing their field.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So then, after that,
something you were working

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
on at the University
of Arizona, Tucson,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.350 align:middle line:84%
that's along this line
called the soul phone.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
those experiments.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:90%
You can just dial up grandma?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Essentially, yes.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.850 align:middle line:84%
You see, we are always
emitting fields,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and those include
electromagnetic fields.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And those electromagnetic
fields can

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
be detected with a suitably
sensitive equipment.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And when equipment is designed
very carefully to detect these

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
fields, with appropriate
filtering and all the kinds

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:84%
of controls you need to
rule out, quote, "noise,"

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:90%
you can actually document--

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and we've done many
experiments in this area--

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
that you can not only
detect the presence--

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
we now call them PMPs,
Post-Material People

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.855 align:middle line:90%
or Participants.

00:04:09.855 --> 00:04:10.655 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: PMPs.

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: PMPs are
collaborators on the other side.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:90%
We also call them the A team.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And these individuals can not
only demonstrate their presence,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
but they can engage
in communication

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.667 align:middle line:84%
that technology can detect
in a rudimentary binary form.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what's
happened with the soul phone?

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: It is in the stage
of beyond what you call proof

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:84%
of concept or proof of principle
to seeing whether we can develop

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:84%
it and become
proof of practical.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
We call it, like, a
Wright brothers moment.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
In the history of
airplanes, as you know,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
the people had tried
for years and failed.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
that one fateful day

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.875 align:middle line:84%
in Kitty Hawk, where I think it
was like five or six people--

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
exact number-- witnessed

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:90%
that first plane, that flight.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:90%
The flight lasted seconds.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have any windows.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't do anything
practically with them.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.700 align:middle line:84%
But the concept was demonstrated
that, in principle, flight

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:90%
was possible.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And the question was, could
you take that possibility

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
and then, through
suitable engineering,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
create something
that's practical?

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that's
where you are now?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.032 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: We are
now on that path--

00:05:23.032 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Of
suitable engineering?

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Yes, to see
whether we can go from the proof

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of possible to the
proof of practical.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.607 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I mean, would
this be something an everyday

00:05:32.607 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:84%
person, consumer could do, or
would it always still be at very

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:90%
large--

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:84%
produce more in larger
arenas and medical research

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.855 align:middle line:90%
or in universities and such?

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:43.355 align:middle line:84%
It's not just going
to be an iPhone.

00:05:43.355 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: In the short
term, it will be like that.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, in
principle, the technology

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.530 align:middle line:84%
could be something where
anyone could use it.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So exciting.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: It would
have to be done carefully,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:84%
because like anything
that is powerful,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.900 align:middle line:84%
its potential for abuse needs to
be considered as also its use.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.453 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Discretion
is advised,

00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know what
you're talking to on the other

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.088 align:middle line:90%
side sometimes.

00:06:08.088 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: And the purposes
that people are talking to them

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.430 align:middle line:90%
on this side.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So now, going from
that and the notion

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:84%
that these energies persist
and we can feel them,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes, people can
feel these kind of energies

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:84%
even more strongly where they're
in some of the sacred sites

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:90%
around the earth, for example.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about why that
is, kind of like ley lines

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and some famous
places where it's

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
a little easier to talk
through to the other side.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Well, the
notion that, again,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
anything that has material--
what we call material form,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and is electromagnetic,
and it has feedback loops,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and all things have feedback
loops, in those systems,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.520 align:middle line:84%
information and
energy can be stored.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:90%
That's how memory occurs.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
In artificial intelligence,
all of these very sophisticated

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:84%
programs, what they all
share in common is feedback.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:90%
No feedback, no learning.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you have
feedback, it means

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that the energy can not only
be stored, but it can build up.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, if people
consistently come with,

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:84%
for example, loving
intentions, and it's prayerful,

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's sacred,
space can then begin

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:84%
to contain that
and preserve that.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And it continues to be
supported as more people come.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.335 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so now,
we're coming to a time where

00:07:36.335 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start
leading into the FLFE,

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Focused Life-Force Energy,
that you're now involved with.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.065 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've had--
and we haven't even

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
begun to hopscotch
through your career.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle line:84%
We just took a couple
of little pixels of it.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And from your background
at all these really

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:84%
leading institutions and
such, how did you first

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:84%
become aware of and involved
with Clayten Stedmann and Jeff

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Stegman?

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.700 align:middle line:84%
How did you become aware of
this technology, which is,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:90%
what, about 10 years old now?

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:90%
About 10 years old.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Like many
things, a complete surprise.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Turned out that a colleague
at the University of Arizona,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
who is a senior member of the
Office of Technology Transfer,

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.050 align:middle line:84%
had learned about this company,
had even tried the free service,

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and experienced positive
benefits for him and his family.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And he became convinced
that that technology

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
was bridging science and
health and spirituality.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that I
might be able to help

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:45.160 align:middle line:84%
them do some of the pioneering
research that they needed to do.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And he also felt that it might
be helpful to me in terms

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:84%
of my path for wanting to be
associated with people who had

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
very high ideals for
creating, quote, "business."

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:84%
As Clayten says, he sees
business as a spiritual path.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.460 align:middle line:84%
It is a way and so
the whole notion

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
that you could literally create
a company who was science-based,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.750 align:middle line:84%
meaning evidence-based,
and that it

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
could be of service to the
greatest good for the greatest

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:84%
amount of humanity, the idea
that someone could actually

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.090 align:middle line:90%
do that, I was very curious.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And so he, Lewis
Humphreys, arranged

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:90%
for us to start meeting.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And although I found
what they were doing

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and what they were claiming
to be quite unusual,

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:90%
to put it mildly--

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and I very much, by the
way, agree with the phrase

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that Carl Sagan, a
well-known skeptic,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
made popular, which is that
extraordinary claims require

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.320 align:middle line:90%
extraordinary evidence.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I became convinced, in
spending many hours with them

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
in Zoom meetings, that they
recognized that and that they

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.590 align:middle line:90%
were truth-seekers.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to learn.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons why I think

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
their company is so effective
is because they're constantly

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
learning from the customers who
are sharing their experiences.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And then what they're
doing is developing

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:90%
based on that feedback.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That feedback.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's one thing.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:84%
I've done a number
of shows here,

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and I've been exposed to a
lot of different technologies,

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and especially
energy technologies.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Everybody just loves
the idea of them

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and will buy them and play
with them and everything.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But the frustration has
been that a lot of them

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:84%
have not gone through
scientific proofs.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
Clayten and Jeff,

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:84%
this was a frustration
of theirs, is it works,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
but how do we prove
that it works?

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So they must have been
thrilled to hear from you.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.143 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: It's-- let's
just say it was like--

00:11:06.143 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It came together.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: It came together.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:08.740 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:90%
The perfect wedding.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.473 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: It was
a perfect wedding.

00:11:11.473 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when you
started, first of all,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:84%
you had to leave your job at the
University of Arizona, Tucson.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.590 align:middle line:84%
How was it transitioning
out of academia?

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:90%
Were there limitations there or?

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: I was planning and
preparing to eventually retire

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
from the University, but not
to retire from trying to be

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:84%
of service through
research and education.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And FLFE became the perfect
vehicle to graduate to.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So as I now explain it, I'm
now graduating from the faculty

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and going into a role where I
can bridge the business world

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and service world, but with
the same level of integrity

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and intention to wanting
to make discoveries,

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.650 align:middle line:84%
to want to expand knowledge
for the betterment of us

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.490 align:middle line:90%
and the planet.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
get into FLFE,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:84%
which I often call "fluffy," or
it's Focused Life-Force Energy.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And let's get into what it
is, because that's still

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:84%
a hard one for people to get
their minds around what it is,

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.882 align:middle line:84%
what its purpose is,
what it does, basically.

00:12:21.882 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Well, Focused
Life-Force Energy, first of all,

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:90%
there are four words--

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:84%
focused, life,
force, and energy.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And those four
words were carefully

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:84%
chosen because they're all
involved with the process.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:90%
But they are expressions of--

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and according to theory,
which was derived in part

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:48.280 align:middle line:84%
from the work of a very
integrative psychiatrist whose

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.460 align:middle line:84%
name is Dr. David Hawkins,
and the theory of what's

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:90%
called levels of consciousness.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
understand FLFE, we

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:84%
have to have an expanded
vision of what science is,

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:90%
of what consciousness is.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And we have to then
understand the relationship

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:84%
between consciousness
and physics.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Now, they do use technology.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.610 align:middle line:90%
The technology is proprietary.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I, by the way,
have intentionally

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.748 align:middle line:84%
remained blind to the
details of the technology.

00:13:22.748 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're not watching
how the sausage is made.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.970 align:middle line:84%
You're just seeing
how beautiful it is.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: I want to
know, if there is sausage,

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:90%
if the sausage is edible.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Does it make people
happy when they eat it?

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I approached
FLFE as I do

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
anything, which is an
open-minded curiosity,

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:90%
but skepticism.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:46.460 align:middle line:90%
So I start with--

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:84%
the way I explain
it to people is,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter whether the
question is, is there a gravity

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:90%
or is there god?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:90%
My response is, I don't know.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Could be yes, could be no.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Show me the data.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm open.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I would
hear the theories

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.380 align:middle line:84%
about how they think it
works, I would step back

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, I hear the
theory, but let's first

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
now see whether or not
this set of procedures

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
produces effects that
you believe happen.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Can we document it in the
real world with real people

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.010 align:middle line:90%
and with real living systems?

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And when we do
that, my jaw drops.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when I first
found out about it,

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:84%
it was not long after
they started up.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:90%
We were talking.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I was talking with them
and they said, yeah,

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:90%
we have this service.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
mean, how do I know?

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, could you put
it on someone else

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:90%
that is really not well?

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:90%
She's kind of close to death.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said, could you put it on
her if I can work meditatively

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.820 align:middle line:90%
to get her soul's permission.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yes,
if you can do that.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we had it
on her apartment.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
She's very sensitive,
sleeping across

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
from a whole bank of smart
meters, next to a cemetery.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.273 align:middle line:84%
Energy was not good, and she
couldn't really speak anymore.

00:15:12.273 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't really
get out of bed much.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:90%
She was just dying.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So I told a mutual friend,
please keep an eye on her

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and see if she talks
the next few days.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
be part of this.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And within a month,
I mean, she started

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.420 align:middle line:84%
talking after a
few days, walking.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.820 align:middle line:84%
At the end of a month, she
was moving furniture around.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.695 align:middle line:84%
And then I revealed to
her what had happened.

00:15:31.695 --> 00:15:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And she's-- there were no
words for her gratitude.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
That's why I decided to, let's
talk about this some more.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Yes.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:90%
You hear accounts by that.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
experience it yourself,

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:84%
as you know, because
you've had your own, now,

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:84%
personal experiences,
it's very hard to deny.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I've
been very impressed with--

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.500 align:middle line:84%
with regard to the
FLFE team is they're

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:90%
very concerned with education.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:84%
They're very concerned
with not sensationalizing.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
They're very
concerned with trying

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to stay close to
what they're doing

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and to give people the
opportunity to experience

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:90%
and make up their own minds.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So essentially, this
technology uses an ID factor,

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
like an address or
telephone number,

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and pick it up from there.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And this signal,
so to speak, this--

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:90%
what did we want to call it?

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.260 align:middle line:90%
The sausage.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: You can call
it part of the field.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.115 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The field.

00:16:35.115 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: It's
very interesting.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to take
this opportunity

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:84%
to explain something,
because it took me

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:90%
a while to understand this.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:84%
They talk about fields
of consciousness,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and that this field
of consciousness

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:90%
extends everywhere.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
when you think of a field

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.580 align:middle line:84%
where you think of, well,
of an electromagnetic field,

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.890 align:middle line:84%
you think of some sort of
thing that's in the field.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.349 align:middle line:84%
But what we don't realize
is that the word-- when

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:84%
they talk about an
electromagnetic field, what

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
they're really
saying, in physics,

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:84%
is that there are effects which
are associated with what we call

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:23.170 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetics, and they are
occurring distributed in space.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:84%
And these properties
of the field,

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.540 align:middle line:84%
of what you see in the
field, is what they're

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:90%
referring to as a field.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:90%
So you have a field of corn.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:84%
The corn, when you're
describing a field of corn,

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:84%
you're describing patterns of
height and patterns of weight.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:84%
You're describing properties
distributed in space.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
All they're saying
is that consciousness

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:84%
is distributed in
space, which is

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:84%
what contemporary
consciousness scientists

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:84%
from all different
walks are coming to.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:03.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we founded an
organization called the Academy

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:84%
for Post-Materialist Sciences,
which brings together these

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
scientists who are
concerned with post-material

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:11.930 align:middle line:90%
consciousness--

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.873 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: --which actually
goes back to very ancient ideas,

00:18:14.873 --> 00:18:20.478 align:middle line:84%
but can now be seen with a new
lens of both theory and methods.

00:18:20.478 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And can be measured.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: What?

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It can be measured.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: And can be
quantified and documented.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's dealing with
those kinds of concepts

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:84%
that people then can
have localized field

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:90%
effects connected by--

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.922 align:middle line:84%
you called it the
plenum of consciousness.

00:18:38.922 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I haven't heard
that word in a long time.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love the word.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.962 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: I happen
to love the word too.

00:18:43.962 --> 00:18:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a young
assistant professor at Harvard,

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:84%
one of the first opportunities
that I did was I had

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to be an
editor of a book series called

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:84%
"Consciousness and
Self-Regulation--

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Advances in Theory
and Research."

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:90%
And you know who published it?

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.645 align:middle line:90%
Plenum.

00:19:01.645 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No wonder
you like the word.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: So we have a
little synchronicity here.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:90%
So, OK, so a person would say--

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.910 align:middle line:84%
if they did a subscription
to this service,

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:84%
they're giving an
ID, an address,

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:84%
or they're giving
a phone number,

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and then that field of
consciousness that they're

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.380 align:middle line:84%
bathed within, that
they live within,

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
starts having an infusion of
higher consciousness energy?

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Yes.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:84%
The theory is that it
raises the consciousness

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.097 align:middle line:90%
of the environment.

00:19:36.097 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like, on
the Hawkins scale.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Yes, that's in the
environment of the location that

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:90%
they've put this field on.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we can measure effects
that change inside the field,

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:90%
inside this space.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.632 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:19:50.632 --> 00:19:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think, for
a lot of people,

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:84%
they say, well, what
about the placebo effect?

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Of course.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's a
legitimate thing to ask.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Absolutely.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
you do is, in certain kinds

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.050 align:middle line:84%
of preparations,
it's really easy

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.120 align:middle line:90%
to control the placebo effect.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So for example, we do
research with plants.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And we look at the
effects of plants,

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:84%
either their growth
rate of the--

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.240 align:middle line:84%
let's say the length of the
leaves that are growing,

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
or the root structure that
are growing in seedlings.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And there, you can have
multiple locations.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And some of them will receive
FLFE and some of them won't.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But the experimenter is blind
as to which is receiving FLFE

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle line:90%
and which is not.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And you did that.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: And
we have done that.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: With larger crops.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: We did it both as
an experiment within a single

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:84%
room, and then also
literally in a field.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what ultimately
happened with the crop?

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems to me this
has significant implications

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:90%
for the future of agriculture.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Absolutely.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Instead of having
to put all these fertilizers

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that replaces
it, but I'm just saying,

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:84%
it seems like there's
a place for it.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Yes.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:10%
I always approach
any research that I

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:10%
do in any area, where,
as I said, I don't know.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:10%
It might, quote, "work."

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It might not, quote,
"work," that is,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.910 align:middle line:84%
we get the predicted
effects or not.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
learn something.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a process of learning.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:84%
With FLFE, I am almost always
surprised, and surprised

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:90%
by the positive findings.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So when they proposed doing this
experiment out in a farm field,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
it's like when I did
work with Lynne McTaggart

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.000 align:middle line:90%
with the intention experiment--

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.680 align:middle line:84%
she just interviewed me today,
incidentally, about this.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
She would want to do
experiments, for example,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
on peace, or she would want to
do an experiment on aggression,

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:84%
or she would want to do other
experiments, for example,

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:90%
on large bodies of water.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And my response would
always be, well,

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:84%
let's do something simpler
first, something that we control

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and we can document is
not A or B. It's not--

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.580 align:middle line:84%
we can't explain it as
a placebo effect per se.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:90%
It's more than just placebo.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:09.260 align:middle line:84%
But then when you not only see
it in such a confined laboratory

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:84%
space, but you see
it in the real world,

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:84%
then you start saying, yes,
this has very big implications.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What did you find?

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
What were the findings of
the one on the larger crop?

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Well, I don't
remember the exact percentage

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:90%
of the bushel of enhancement--

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But just
overview of it.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle line:90%
How'd it go?

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: But the basic
finding was that there was

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:84%
a statistically significant
increase in the yield

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:84%
in the parts of the field that
had FLFE compared to the control

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle line:90%
parts of the field.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's significant.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are you or
is anybody else there

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:84%
playing with more of this
at home on their own gardens

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:90%
or plants or anything or?

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: I
know customers do.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:90%
I know that Jeffrey does.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.147 align:middle line:84%
He just recently bought
a farm and he's--

00:23:01.147 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He's
playing with it there.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:03.105 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Of course.

00:23:03.105 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah,
of course he would.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: It's
hard not to play--

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Why wouldn't you?

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Why wouldn't you?

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, no,
it's fascinating.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:90%
So you did do that.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And that study is
available for anybody

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.230 align:middle line:90%
who wants to check into it.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the studies
that you've done,

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
as you mentioned a
little while ago,

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:84%
are kind of customer
feedback studies.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:90%
How--

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Sure.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I
was first invited

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:33.030 align:middle line:84%
to help FLFE doing design
research that could test things,

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, the first thing
I think you should do

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
is address, what are
people looking for

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.910 align:middle line:90%
and what do they report?

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.970 align:middle line:84%
You could call it, quote,
the "low-hanging fruit."

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But just because a
fruit is low-hanging

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean the fruit isn't
delicious or important.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And in point of fact,
what people often say,

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
well, yes, but it's
not a physics matter.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not a physiology measure.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a
person, for example,

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're having
difficulty sleeping,

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.280 align:middle line:84%
or you're having trouble
in family relationships,

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.670 align:middle line:84%
what are you looking for,
a measure of your blood

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
pressure, or are you
looking for help in the area

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:90%
that you are experiencing?

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So it starts with
experience, because if you

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:84%
can't show an
experience effect, why

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.070 align:middle line:84%
does somebody want to
spend money and have

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
this in their household if they
can't have a direct experience,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:90%
like you've had?

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it turned
out that they had

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:84%
a vast amount of spontaneous
data, spontaneous testimonials,

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
shared on things
like social media.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And the question was,
were there any patterns

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:44.010 align:middle line:84%
to that uncontrolled
data, and was it

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:47.580 align:middle line:84%
possible to create
an instrument to see

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:84%
whether you could
validate whether or not

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:84%
people were actually
having these experiences

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and how large were
those effects?

00:24:55.770 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So we created a structured-- we
call it the Customer Experience

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Survey--

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:84%
where we looked at the
most commonly spontaneously

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.490 align:middle line:84%
reported customer
reports of what

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:90%
they experienced benefitting.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What were
the most common?

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Well, ones
that I found truly--

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I still marvel at this--

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:22.380 align:middle line:84%
is, for example, to the
item, do you find it easier

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
to shift from negative to
positive thoughts in your life?

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that
you find yourself

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.700 align:middle line:90%
being more forgiving of others?

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you find it
easier to meditate

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:90%
and to go with the flow?

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Qualities that are actually of
a higher level of consciousness

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
than simply, I'm
experiencing less insomnia,

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:84%
or I'm feeling less anxiety,
both of which are important.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:26:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But the theory is that there's
an elevation in consciousness.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
that people spontaneously

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:84%
report changes that are
consistent with the idea

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:84%
that some people's
consciousness is

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:84%
being elevated in the presence
of an elevating consciousness

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I've also
read that the same applies,

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times, to get
beyond the placebo principle,

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.883 align:middle line:84%
is animals that are in
that given household.

00:26:28.883 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of that I find
kind of interesting.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.183 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Oh, I find
that totally fascinating.

00:26:33.183 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
tell us, I love--

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:84%
everybody loves kitty and
doggie stories-- horses,

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:84%
for that matter-- so what are
some of the effects that people

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.320 align:middle line:90%
have had?

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Well, people
report, for example, that the--

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and again, I don't keep stories
of all these testimonials

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.530 align:middle line:90%
in my head.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
But you'll hear
reports, for example,

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:57.860 align:middle line:84%
of people will have an
FLFE attached to an object,

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
like a phone, so it can
be carried with you.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll leave
a phone in the area,

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and then the dog
will end up choosing

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:84%
to sleep near the phone,
not because it rings

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.550 align:middle line:84%
or because they're expecting
their owner to pick up

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:13.492 align:middle line:90%
the phone, but because--

00:27:13.492 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The consciousness,
the frequency being generated

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:90%
by it.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:10%
>> SCHWARTZ: People
spontaneously report that

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.315 align:middle line:10%
wildlife in their area
tends to be increased--

00:27:23.315 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.607 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: --that wildlife
tends to be more likely

00:27:26.607 --> 00:27:28.158 align:middle line:90%
to congregate near their homes.

00:27:28.158 --> 00:27:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it makes
sense if it feels good,

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.802 align:middle line:90%
it's got good vibes.

00:27:31.802 --> 00:27:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Of course.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.718 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:36.865 align:middle line:84%
So then we get into
a topic that I really

00:27:36.865 --> 00:27:38.240 align:middle line:84%
wanted to get into
here, which is

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:84%
why I wanted to
do this interview,

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:84%
because it's so difficult
for so many people.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
notion that we're

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:49.970 align:middle line:84%
being bombarded with a lot
of different frequencies.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I know even here in Boulder,
they've activated their 5G

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:84%
network, and a lot of cities
around the world have done that.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But even prior to that,
just the amount of Wi-Fi

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and little modem
activity at home

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:84%
is creating a lot of
edginess and energy drain

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of wanted to see
what was going to happen

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:16.977 align:middle line:90%
with FLFE applied to that.

00:28:16.977 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I wanted
to know what would

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.890 align:middle line:90%
happen if they ever did that.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what's happened with that.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Sure.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.830 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the areas that I
find so fascinating about them,

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:33.630 align:middle line:84%
is because as I said, they
learn from problems, often,

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:84%
as well as solutions that
customers are reporting.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So as I understand
it, the initiation

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.160 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to look
at EMF sensitivity

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and mitigating the
effects of EMF sensitivity

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
was actually triggered by
some customers reporting

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
that the positive effects
that they were experiencing

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:84%
in the quality of
their life on FLFE

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.460 align:middle line:84%
tended to be attenuated with
the presence, for example,

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.420 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic fields, that
the electromagnetic fields were

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.137 align:middle line:84%
interfering with the FLFE
effects in the consciousness.

00:29:13.137 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it makes sense.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: And in attempting
to, quote, "address" that issue,

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Clayten and Jeff realized
that if they could build

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:32.320 align:middle line:84%
into the program the capability
to mitigate some of these EMF

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:84%
effects, it would, in turn,
then contribute to the overall

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:40.030 align:middle line:84%
effectiveness of FLFE in terms
of its higher consciousness

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:84%
That's what started
them on this path.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we discovered
that, sure enough,

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:50.140 align:middle line:84%
people who were
primarily interested

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.100 align:middle line:84%
in getting relief from some
of the major symptoms of EMF

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:84%
mitigation could be helped by
going on an FLFE program that

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.270 align:middle line:90%
was focused on EMF mitigation.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they had to
engineer a program that allowed

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:13.170 align:middle line:84%
the FLFE frequency to
essentially modulate, transform,

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.460 align:middle line:90%
what, with these other signals?

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Again, here's where
we start getting into theory.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And the theory is interesting,
but until you test the theory,

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.440 align:middle line:90%
it's just a theory.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But the theory is that what
FLFE does with the higher

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
consciousness field is it
tends to harmonize some

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:84%
of the disparateness
in the fields

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
so that instead of there being--
there's less of a cacophony.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:45.150 align:middle line:84%
It's more of an organized
symphony, if you would,

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.040 align:middle line:90%
of signals.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And therefore
there's less chaos--

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I actually saw the
work of a woman who was using

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.670 align:middle line:84%
one of Konstantin
Korotkov's devices.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was so funny because
you were here earlier today

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and you saw his lab coat hanging
here and said, do you know him?

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Has he been here?

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:04.980 align:middle line:90%
And yes, he has.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.060 align:middle line:90%
You know Konstantin.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:90%
We love him.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So he created these
GDV cameras that

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.948 align:middle line:84%
were allowing you to see
the emanation-- initially,

00:31:12.948 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:84%
in his work, from plants
and other things--

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.550 align:middle line:90%
see the life force around them.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And so this Bio-Well is the
technology that's a little bit

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:24.520 align:middle line:84%
newer and a little more
affordable for practitioners,

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:31.260 align:middle line:84%
was employed to test in a
domain that had problems with 5G

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:90%
signal.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So they showed-- they used the
camera or the device to show

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.820 align:middle line:84%
what the field looked like
before when 5G was on and then

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.570 align:middle line:84%
after, when FLFE
was applied to 5G.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.700 align:middle line:84%
It looked exactly like
what you talked about.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It flattened all
these spiky edges out.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Yes.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.020 align:middle line:84%
What they were-- I think a
better way of framing this is

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:57.820 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Please do.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: --is that they were
measuring the background measure

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:08.760 align:middle line:84%
of what they call entropy,
which is a measure of chaotic

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.400 align:middle line:84%
"disorder," in
quotes, in a signal,

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.060 align:middle line:84%
which you see as variability
on a moment-to-moment basis,

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
both when FLFE was off
versus when FLFE was on.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Was on, yeah.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: And when FLFE
was on, using the GDV cameras,

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:84%
its measure of entropy, they
were able to see a clear

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:90%
difference.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.297 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was-- when
I saw that, I thought,

00:32:31.297 --> 00:32:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I want to do that, because I'm
sensitive, and I travel a lot,

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and I stay in, sometimes, hotels
that have such a massive amount

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:90%
of Wi-Fi running through it.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.220 align:middle line:90%
And so I don't sleep.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.810 align:middle line:90%
I find the energy very spiky.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:90%
So that piqued my curiosity.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So where has everything
gone since then?

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I think there have been
some evolutionary leaps on that.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Yes.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my understanding is
they're coming out with the FLFE

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.680 align:middle line:90%
EMF mitigation program 5.0.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.548 align:middle line:84%
And if I understand, you
were the very first--

00:33:07.548 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yep, I was a--

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: --beta
test subject.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I was.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:12.255 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: And what
did you experience?

00:33:12.255 --> 00:33:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had been using the
original EMF mitigation

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:84%
for hotel rooms to take some
of the spikes out of my room,

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.060 align:middle line:90%
out of the energy in my field.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd sleep with my phone
right on the little bed stand

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.780 align:middle line:90%
right next to me.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.540 align:middle line:90%
And that was helpful.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But when they invited
me to do this beta test,

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:36.580 align:middle line:84%
because I love this, one of
the first things I noticed--

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.110 align:middle line:84%
in fact, this gets into
real consciousness.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things I
noticed is that there was, like,

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:47.450 align:middle line:84%
a field supporting
and protecting me,

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and that all I can
describe is the field--

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.880 align:middle line:84%
my field, or their field,
the field felt quiet.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, so what is
mine and what is not mine?

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.550 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
thing I wondered,

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:05.630 align:middle line:84%
was then I started
sleeping better,

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have
to take melatonin.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's interesting.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.889 align:middle line:84%
So I kept looking at it through
this particular lens, which

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:18.190 align:middle line:84%
is, if it seems to be kind
of protecting all of me

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:21.730 align:middle line:84%
in this field, it must
be that some of the more

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:25.370 align:middle line:84%
negative impacts aren't making
its way into my closed field,

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.800 align:middle line:84%
the things that normally
would be disturbing.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK, so if I'm
disturbed on a given day,

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I would look at, if my
field was disturbed,

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.409 align:middle line:90%
what did I do to disturb it?

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:84%
What is mine and
what is not mine?

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:84%
And that was huge, to see
where I'm generating negativity

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:48.400 align:middle line:84%
in my field versus where I
have a totally clear field

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually been
coming from somewhere else.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: If I may
be so bold as to say--

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and I think I have a
fairly good case to make--

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: --you are a
somewhat atypical person

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your evolution and
sensitivity, and therefore,

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.550 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be easier
for you to make those kinds

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.550 align:middle line:90%
of discoveries.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm sure not
everybody will feel it--

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: What?

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.303 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm sure not
everybody will feel it that way,

00:35:15.303 --> 00:35:16.560 align:middle line:90%
but for me, it was pronounced.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Everybody
won't feel it that way.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:22.430 align:middle line:84%
People vary tremendously
in their sensitivities

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.650 align:middle line:90%
to things in consciousness.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:26.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's why people--

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.240 align:middle line:84%
what I find also
interesting about FLFE

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.660 align:middle line:84%
is that they tend
to attract customers

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.150 align:middle line:90%
who are more sensitive.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to be somewhat
more caring and somewhat more

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:43.400 align:middle line:84%
devoted to wanting to
see improvements made,

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.570 align:middle line:90%
and elevating humanity.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again, the kind of
movement that you want to see.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:84%
You want to see people who are
experiencing a technology that

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:57.960 align:middle line:84%
is being driven by scientific
evidence and creative insight.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, so let's say I'm on
the extreme sensitive side.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm part of a beta
experiment that may or may not

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:11.853 align:middle line:84%
reflect what the bulk of the
customer base might experience.

00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what others have
experienced because I'm just

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:15.450 align:middle line:90%
now talking to you.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: I'm just saying
that there's a level of subtlety

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.990 align:middle line:84%
to you as an interviewer
and you as a person,

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:22.527 align:middle line:90%
and that's to be celebrated.

00:36:22.527 --> 00:36:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Why, thank you.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, all I know is I love that
feeling, where I feel like,

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.310 align:middle line:84%
at least I know, if there's
anything perturbing going on,

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:31.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing it.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not picking up someone
else's thoughts or energy

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.390 align:middle line:84%
in my field, that just
feels clear and clean.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:37.190 align:middle line:90%
So I like--

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Well, being able to
discern that is very valuable.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I thought so.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: And that's one of
the subjective experiences that

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:84%
people often
spontaneously report,

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.060 align:middle line:90%
increased mental clarity.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, now, what about--

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.160 align:middle line:84%
there have to be people
that doesn't work on.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.820 align:middle line:90%
And what is their experience?

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Just, flat, like,
I don't feel it?

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Well, there are
some people who don't notice any

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.640 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And like anything, some people
respond more strongly and some

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.590 align:middle line:90%
people don't.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.500 align:middle line:84%
What I find most
interesting, which

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.020 align:middle line:84%
gets back to the
placebo question,

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:16.040 align:middle line:84%
is that one of the questions we
asked in the really big customer

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:84%
experience survey, which
we've also now replicated--

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.590 align:middle line:84%
one of the strategies
of programmatic research

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:25.470 align:middle line:84%
is replicate and extend,
replicate and extend.

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is one
of those findings

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.530 align:middle line:90%
that is replicate and extend.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:32.390 align:middle line:84%
If you ask people the
following question--

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:84%
to what extent were the effects
that you experienced with FLFE

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.840 align:middle line:84%
greater than you expected,
equal to what you expected,

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.312 align:middle line:90%
or less than what you expected?

00:37:43.312 --> 00:37:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that would be a
common question you would ask

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:46.840 align:middle line:90%
in this kind of surveying.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
we find routinely

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:84%
is more than half
the sample report

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.030 align:middle line:84%
that the effects
that they experience

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:59.032 align:middle line:84%
are greater than
what they expected

00:37:59.032 --> 00:38:00.115 align:middle line:90%
because they're surprised.

00:38:00.115 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, because you
don't know what to expect.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: They're surprised.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And their effects
are the very largest

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:12.120 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the changes,
which is almost anti-placebo.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I hear you.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:14.780 align:middle line:90%
And the audience watching this--

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people
watching Gaia

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and this show are probably
pretty sensitive themselves.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Absolutely.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they'll understand
what we're talking about.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.200 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking about this.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:84%
What's so wonderful is
that you, as an academic,

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:84%
have engaged in this to try
to show proofs of concept

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:84%
to something in
this unseen realm

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.510 align:middle line:90%
that people are benefiting from.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.600 align:middle line:84%
It must also be giving other
companies that are coming up

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.550 align:middle line:84%
with their own kind of energy
or consciousness technologies

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:45.302 align:middle line:84%
the motivation to start
bringing scientists like you on.

00:38:45.302 --> 00:38:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: I would hope so.

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I would hope that
FLFE as a company

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.680 align:middle line:84%
can serve as a role
model for other companies

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.740 align:middle line:84%
to take this kind of
business as a spiritual path

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.512 align:middle line:84%
seriously, an
evidence-based path.

00:38:58.512 --> 00:38:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think
we're there now.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:84%
We need it, because
people-- the final one

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:06.400 align:middle line:84%
is, we're still in the age
of scientific materialism.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.610 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people's
wife will come home,

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:12.100 align:middle line:84%
or a man will come home and say,
wow, I heard about this thing.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.952 align:middle line:84%
That sounds-- no,
where's the proof?

00:39:13.952 --> 00:39:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.392 align:middle line:90%
Where's the proof?

00:39:16.392 --> 00:39:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're
getting to the point

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.250 align:middle line:84%
where we have the
sophistication of technology

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:24.000 align:middle line:84%
to prove many different
beautiful, energy-based

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.470 align:middle line:84%
technologies and
gifts out there.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:27.563 align:middle line:90%
So that's wonderful.

00:39:27.563 --> 00:39:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Even right down
to crystals, being

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:84%
able to measure the output of
crystals, where it was just

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.962 align:middle line:90%
lore once upon a time.

00:39:33.962 --> 00:39:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: And one of the
things that's also beautiful is

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that this is a precious moment
in time for humanity to be alive

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.200 align:middle line:84%
because technology has
advanced to such a degree,

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.620 align:middle line:84%
we can now measure
single photons of light

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.780 align:middle line:90%
in a pitch-black environment.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.240 align:middle line:84%
We can measure what's
called femtoamps of current.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.800 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about tiny, tiny,
tiny amounts of electrical flow.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And so consequently,
the tools that

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.010 align:middle line:84%
are coming out of
contemporary physics

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and bioengineering become
the tools you need.

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But then they need to be applied
to these frontier questions.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So we often talk about--
we use mainstream methods

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.575 align:middle line:90%
to address frontier questions.

00:40:17.575 --> 00:40:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy that
you chose to leave--

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:84%
you were never mainstream, but
leave the world of academics

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:29.040 align:middle line:84%
to go into this new field of
proofs of concept that is so--

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it's so important
for people that are pioneers

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:33.870 align:middle line:90%
in these energy fields to have.

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they need your support.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Well, one of the
other things I can say about--

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.770 align:middle line:84%
since you mentioned, for
example, life after death,

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:44.140 align:middle line:84%
survival of consciousness,
greater spiritual reality,

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and so on, is that my work
and my colleagues' work

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.320 align:middle line:84%
on technology for being
able to communicate with

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.580 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness and energy
of people who have "died,"

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:57.960 align:middle line:90%
meaning transitioned--

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Post-material.

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Post-material
people, exactly.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:08.000 align:middle line:10%
Is, for many companies,
that's taboo,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.880 align:middle line:10%
or it would not be a
good affiliation for them

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.690 align:middle line:10%
because it's so controversial,
whereas for a company like FLFE,

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:17.270 align:middle line:10%
rather than that
being a liability,

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:20.900 align:middle line:10%
they actually saw
that as something that

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:26.030 align:middle line:10%
was an additional contribution
to the mission of their company.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of work, everything
is feeding everything else.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.760 align:middle line:90%
It's part of it--

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's beautiful.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Yes, it's--

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're writing
a book on the experiments right

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.040 align:middle line:84%
now, so you kind of have a
collection of the various

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.373 align:middle line:84%
experiments you've been running
and the results of them.

00:41:39.373 --> 00:41:40.487 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Yes.

00:41:40.487 --> 00:41:42.570 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a book called "The
Afterlife Experiments."

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:45.070 align:middle line:10%
I then wrote a book called "The
Energy Healing Experiments."

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.360 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a book called
"The God Experiments."

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And now in the
process of finishing

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.185 align:middle line:84%
the first draft of a book
on the FLFE experiments.

00:41:53.185 --> 00:41:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:54.600 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, Gary, thank you for
spending an entire lifetime

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:03.860 align:middle line:84%
being open-minded and serving
all of these pioneering fields

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.810 align:middle line:84%
where the unseen world,
which constitutes far more

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:10.920 align:middle line:84%
than the seen world, can finally
be given proofs to, whether it's

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.560 align:middle line:90%
from mediumship to FLFE.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate the work
you've done over your lifetime.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:21.160 align:middle line:84%
A very open-minded
man who demands proof.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Gary.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.935 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you again.

00:42:24.935 --> 00:42:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>> SCHWARTZ: Good to see you.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.872 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'll still always
like the time we did sushi

00:42:27.872 --> 00:42:30.120 align:middle line:90%
at Harvey Nichols in London on--

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.495 align:middle line:84%
we did sushi off
a conveyor belt.

00:42:31.495 --> 00:42:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Off
a conveyor belt.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That was fun.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:35.260 align:middle line:90%
That was a while back.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me, Gary.

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SCHWARTZ: Thank
you for having me.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.302 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To find out
more about Gary's research

00:42:40.302 --> 00:42:43.782 align:middle line:84%
and the FLFE programs,
you can go to flfe.net.

00:42:43.782 --> 00:42:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't have enough
positive things

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.920 align:middle line:90%
to say about this innovation.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:90%
This is the future.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on "Open Minds."

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:54.200 align:middle line:90%
