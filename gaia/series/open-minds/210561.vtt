00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: When the world
exploded the atomic bomb,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.620 align:middle line:84%
it got the attention of
a lot of cosmic cultures.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Not only were there
crashes and so forth,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.180 align:middle line:90%
there were visitations.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:84%
I had seen the Integratron--
and then, all I needed to do

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:84%
is start interviewing people
from back in those days

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:84%
to find out that what I believe
to be the real ETs were people.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't about religion,
it was about this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
is a highly kept secret and
black projects that make money.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And as Colonel Corso
told me, weapons of war.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
You mean, you're telling me
that in 1970, you guys saw space

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:90%
people coming off the ship?

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yes.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.782 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Back
in more innocent times,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:10%
the 1950s and '60s, there was
a different type of contact

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:10%
that was taking place
between extraterrestrials

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:10%
and human beings.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, well-dressed
visitors approached

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.460 align:middle line:84%
men who were highly
intelligent, but not necessarily

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:90%
academically oriented.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:90%
In other words, open-minded.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Their messages to humanity
have stood the test of time,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:90%
but we ignored them.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:90%
So welcome back Paola.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Well, it's wonderful
to be here, especially to talk

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:90%
about the situation with you.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah I just--

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:90%
this is a topic I really love.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was very grateful.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and I,
as everyone knows,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
have been through a lot
of adventures together.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:84%
We've done quite a few
kind of joint interviews.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
You introduced me
to Paul Hellyer,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
who was the former Defense
Minister of Canada.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: You came to
Italy to see the giants.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.797 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've
done-- we go back.

00:01:42.797 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: We go back, yeah.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.255 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But one
of the things I

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:84%
really love and I'm very
grateful for was your

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:84%
originally turning me
on to the stories that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:90%
happened in the '50s and '60s.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a
sweet time of contact

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that turned into kind
of a dirty affair

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
with everyone competing
with each other,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and calling each other liars,
and you know, stealing stuff.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:84%
It became very
undignified, I have to say.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But back then, there
was some dignity to it.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.102 align:middle line:84%
So how did you
first come across--

00:02:13.102 --> 00:02:15.310 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
Howard Menger and his book,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.673 align:middle line:84%
From Outer Space to
You, which I love.

00:02:17.673 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.757 align:middle line:90%
How did you come about that?

00:02:19.757 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: Well, I call it back
to the future, because I,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.620 align:middle line:10%
like all people that
had worked in ufology--

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:10%
and I am a journalist
rather than ufologists,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:10%
I want to say that--

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:10%
I care about history.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I care about the history,
and I've always looked at it

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:90%
in the timeline of history.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And no, history did
not begin with 1947,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
it began even more,
because we know we've

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:90%
done the 1945 Trinity case.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:10%
When the world exploded
the atomic bomb,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:10%
it got the attention of
a lot of cosmic cultures.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:10%
Not only were there,
you know, crashes

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:10%
and so forth, there
were visitations.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
timeline of the 1950s,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and what was going on
in Southern California--

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and California has been a
pioneer in a lot of things--

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
then I had to go back and
look at the Space Brother

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:84%
movement, what's called
the Space Brother movement.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.610 align:middle line:10%
So I had been to Giant Rock,
I had seen the location,

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:10%
I had seen the Integratron.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:10%
And then, all I needed to
do is start interviewing

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:10%
people from back in
those days to find out

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:10%
that what I believe to be
the real ETs were people.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And they came here in the
1950s, because we jump-started

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
the new age, what we call the
new age today, with Yogananda,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
with Maharishi, with
the new thinking.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even Adamski, he
would call his lectures

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:90%
the Temple of Tibet.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.787 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Anyway, and also-- so
yeah, and you agreed with that.

00:04:01.787 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:90%
You thought it was--

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, no, absolutely,
and just to kind of further

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:84%
validate-- when I had no
interest in any of this,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
back in the mid-'80s or so, when
I was talking with my own group

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
of beings, a couple of people
had had experiences and I asked

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
them, well, are
they really here?

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
exactly what you said--

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
they have an increased
interest, now

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that you have
nuclear capabilities,

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and you'll often
find them surfacing

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
around military
bases, and they're

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
watching military activity
all over the planet,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and have been, exactly, since
we started playing with that.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.090 align:middle line:84%
They said, that will not
be allowed to go out.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we actually tried
to shoot a nuclear weapon

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:90%
to the moon at one point.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:90%
They--

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Colonel Corso said--

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:44.857 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was taken down.

00:04:44.857 --> 00:04:46.255 align:middle line:90%
I mean, literally, it was this--

00:04:46.255 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Project Horizon
was testing nuclear.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The film
of it was amazing.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.833 align:middle line:84%
The way that spacecraft
came in and took it out.

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's not going
to be allowed,

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:84%
we're not allowed to pollute
the rest of our cosmos.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So they're very-- that was
the validation on that.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:84%
The other one was
Adamski stating

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that there are over
400,000 humanoid species

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
throughout the universes--
that he knew of at the time.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:84%
This is a very common,
efficient vehicle.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: Yes, and
it's normal for me

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:10%
to think that other
planets are inhabited.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.430 align:middle line:10%
Why not?

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why not?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.818 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But not
just with praying

00:05:20.818 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
mantis types that we talk
about underground in Earth,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.115 align:middle line:84%
and little ETs,
but actual humans,

00:05:27.115 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:84%
what look to be human beings,
structured very similar to us,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:84%
as we were once long ago
here, developed this way.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So were humans developed
on other planets.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.620 align:middle line:84%
It must just be a good vehicle
to be able to express through.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yes, and we're
going to see some pictures

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.560 align:middle line:84%
today of Val Thor,
and Jill, and Don,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and everybody says, how come
they're so good-looking?

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, maybe you
could get to the point where

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:84%
you can clone a human being--
and I know that they have done

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.330 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and then you put a
consciousness into it.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you had a choice
as a consciousness,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:90%
you'd pick a beautiful body.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:90%
You'd pick one that would--

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
almost like going shopping,
you could pick a body

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that you would like, and
take good care of it.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:10%
But you know, what interested
me was-- and Colonel Corso said

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:10%
to me once, he said,
Paolo, he said,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:10%
the extraterrestrial
biological entity, he said,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:10%
is kind of a clone.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:10%
He said, we've done
an autopsy on him.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:10%
And of course, in my
book, Conversations

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.620 align:middle line:10%
with Colonel Corso,
he gave me a drawing

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:10%
of the autopsy
that they had done,

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:10%
plus he had said how close
they were to the human body.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
He said, but we weren't worried
at the Pentagon about those.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:90%
We knew what they were.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, we were worried
about who created them.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they could
walk through the halls

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:90%
of the Pentagon and never be--

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: John Warner
IV said, that's what

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:90%
an Admiral told him.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:90%
You want to know what ET is?

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:90%
Look around you.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the Pentagon.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So, they're walking up and
down the halls of the Pentagon.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back for
just one moment,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
for people who aren't
familiar with it.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Colonel Philip
Corso wrote the book,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:84%
The Day after Roswell, which
talked about the debris from

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:84%
the Roswell wreckage that
was then back-engineered by--

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: The Army.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:90%
The Army, yeah.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The military
industrial complex, Bell Labs

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.990 align:middle line:90%
and others.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.407 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of stuff
came out of it.

00:07:17.407 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Really interesting
book to read for people

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
interested in this topic and
what happened back in '47.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So that gives the context
for who Corso was,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:90%
as you're talking.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yes, and I
have to go with what

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:90%
people of that caliber tell me.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:84%
He was a hero, and
that he admitted

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:90%
that he had these artifacts.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said to make the
competitive edge of the Army--

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:84%
because I think that different
branches compete for contracts.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the Air Force
probably had it,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.993 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't have a
Corso to talk about it.

00:07:50.993 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
to talk about it.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.400 align:middle line:84%
They did have stuff parceled
out, and it was, I think,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
13, 14 years after
'61, I believe.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:90%
The crash was '47--

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:90%
'61, the general--

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Well,
the crash of '45--

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:84%
in 1945, went to the
Atomic Energy Commission.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:90%
So they had that stuff, too.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then, they got
the Army and whomever was there,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Air Force, that took the
debris away from Roswell,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:90%
parted it out.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And he did this under the--
and she was with the foreign

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.340 align:middle line:84%
technology division in
the military, meaning--

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:90%
didn't mean Cuba.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: No, foreign-- as
foreign as you can get, yes.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they had him
have everything analyzed.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.369 align:middle line:84%
In 1961, it was delivered
in a metal filing cabinet,

00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:90%
as I recall.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Actually, Regina,
I've got to be honest,

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:90%
that changed my life.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized that the
secret was being kept secret

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
because of the technology,
not because there would be

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:90%
panic all over the world.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
If they look like us, there's
no panic all over the world.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:10%
I mean, so you know, it
wasn't about religion,

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:10%
it was about this is a highly
kept secret and black projects

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:10%
that make money.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And as Colonel Corso
told me, weapons of war.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So you know, now I know
why the secret is secret.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, not only that--

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:84%
they turned the use--
they used the technology

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
that they were exposed
to for warlike purposes.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:90%
It can also be used for good.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.382 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can be
used to literally

00:09:20.382 --> 00:09:23.130 align:middle line:90%
power the entire planet.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Free energy, all of it was
available to us at the time.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But it was all
sequestered and used

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.960 align:middle line:90%
for darker military purposes.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And for profit-- some
of it helped humanity.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly, you could
say that fiber optics helped

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:90%
humanity.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.635 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Night
screening devices,

00:09:40.635 --> 00:09:41.760 align:middle line:90%
yeah, and all those things.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kevlar for
police vests, and all.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't all bad, but
they even said at the time,

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
if this is misused, you can
blow this place to smithereens.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
very careful with what

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.070 align:middle line:90%
you choose to develop there.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.237 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: Well, that's one
of the reasons I went back

00:09:58.237 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:10%
to the future, because--

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:10%
and I keep saying
back to the future.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
When I went to High
Bridge in New Jersey

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
to look up the Menger case,
we were in the Cold War--

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Russia was the enemy.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And we had missiles
pointed at Russia,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.690 align:middle line:84%
like the Malmstrom Air
Force base in 1969.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And they had missiles
pointed at us.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a time that's now.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, now.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Basically,
they were warning

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:90%
of what was going to happen.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:90%
We're there.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are right now.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Well, we're
there right now.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's go back now--

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:90%
let's go back to Howard Menger.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And here we can see a
photo of Howard Menger.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was a very
intelligent man.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:84%
He actually did
printing for a living.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But very bright,
very open-minded,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:90%
curious, and kind of refined.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:10%
So when you look at the
way his book is written,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:10%
the language then was more
gentlemanly, more gentle,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:10%
more refined in
general, more credulous.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Where, if someone meets you
and says, I'm from Venus,

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and they certainly seem to have
a strange craft and energy,

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.445 align:middle line:84%
people are going to say,
OK, all right, tell me more.

00:11:02.445 --> 00:11:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Right, they're not going
to get a gun out and start

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:90%
shooting at them.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: No, it was
a different world.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:10%
And I think you probably
saw the video where

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:10%
he said he heard this
beautiful music in this cabin,

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.160 align:middle line:10%
and he went down
to meet the people.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And the people were
beautiful people.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
could do this, too.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And he learned music by ear.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.113 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And he did compose.

00:11:26.113 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: And he did compose.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.340 align:middle line:84%
What's nice, and I'm
going to reiterate this,

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.900 align:middle line:90%
is this is an East Coast story.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We usually go to the
West Coast stories,

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:84%
like the Adamskis
and Van Tassels,

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Orfeo Angeluccis, and all
those guys were West Coast.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:90%
This is East Coast.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:10%
And that's why this story wasn't
researched as much, because I

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:10%
wondered, why
didn't they go back

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:10%
to High Bridge in New
Jersey, near New York

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:10%
and research the story?

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:90%
It's very unique.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's talk about it.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.497 align:middle line:84%
So he was 10 years old when
a beautiful Venutian woman

00:11:56.497 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:90%
met him out in the forest.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, blink, blink.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:90%
And he's kind of smitten.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I'm
here to tell you

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.200 align:middle line:84%
that you have a
special place with us.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, he was to learn
that he is from-- like Adamski,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:84%
was one of them, but
he was born as a human

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to start bringing
this information through.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:90%
So they conditioned him slowly.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Met with him over the years.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.483 align:middle line:84%
And protected him
in Okinawa when

00:12:24.483 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:84%
he was in the war--
he should have

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:90%
been killed many times over.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But they protected him
until he came of age

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
to where they could start
giving him the real experiences

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:90%
and messages.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about those.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:10%
Because that's really
the point of this.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.300 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: Right, the
messages, and the fact that--

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:10%
and you have to digest
this, that most--

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:10%
even in Latin America--
most ETs look like us.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:10%
And are mixed in with humans.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:10%
And people that work in this
area, the study, the Space

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:10%
Brother movement, have had some
kind of contact with people--

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:10%
even Timothy Goode said he met
one in New York in a hotel,

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:10%
he told me.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And telepathically, he said to
the being, are you from here?

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not from
here, Timothy Goode

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
said, put your
right index finger

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:90%
on the left side of your nose.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And the man did that.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So that makes you stop
thinking that the field is

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.710 align:middle line:84%
only little gray aliens,
or all different types.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
starts coming later.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: That came later.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
That came in the '60s after
the Betty and Barney Hill case.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Before that, they were
all human like us.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is an incredible
story, because we have photos.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:10%
And because the
photographer, August Roberts,

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.290 align:middle line:10%
has left notes about
taking these photos.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So when these beings
started meeting him-- with him,

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:10%
as he was older, a couple of
things were happening, right?

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Where first of all,
he was assisting them

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.600 align:middle line:90%
to integrate with humanity.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and they told
him, you're not the only one.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:84%
We've reached out
to quite a number

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
of open-minded individuals who
feel safe enough to do this.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was helping the guys
look a little more normal

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:90%
for the '50s and '60s--

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
cut their hair off,
because a lot of them had--

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:84%
the men had long, flowing
hair, very beautiful, right?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: The thing that
I always look for--

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and I've done other stories
on human-type aliens--

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:90%
is that they usually overdress.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:90%
All the guys--

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to see
an example of that in a minute.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: They think everybody
wears a suit and tie.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You see them now.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Picnic attire, yeah.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain who the people
are in order on the screen.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: OK, well there's
Jill, who has got high heels on

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and a very, very beautiful
handbag in leather.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.600 align:middle line:90%
She looks like Grace Kelly.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And there's Don, Val's brother.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.220 align:middle line:90%
And there's Val Thor.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Val is the one on the
end that's taking notes.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Because what Val did--

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he was listening
to Howard Menger talk.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.163 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: I know, it's like
stranger at the Pentagon--

00:15:00.163 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:90%
could he leave the Pentagon?

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes, he could go
where he wanted.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And yeah--

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And better dressed.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, and there's
hundreds people in this photo,

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:84%
because these photos
are incredible.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're just sitting and
getting an outdoor lecture.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And we actually enlarge
on what Val was writing,

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:84%
and the first sentence
is, we are one.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was very, very
impressed by that,

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
because I mean, here's
a contactee-- they're

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
in the contactee's backyard,
with his first wife, Rose,

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:90%
in High Bridge.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the reason
why I think this is important,

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:84%
these photos, is
because when I went back

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:84%
with David Kalbosser
and Bill Crowley,

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to stand in the very
spot where Val and Jill and Don

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:84%
were, because we felt
that if we believed

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:55.350 align:middle line:84%
there was no time, that
we were there in the 1953.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:90%
And they were here with us.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There you
are at the tree.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, well, because I
had to find the exact location.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like, that's
field research.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.452 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, It and
you're famous for that.

00:16:06.452 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Well, that's the only
way I can find anything out.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and you
are-- you're the best.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:10%
And so when they would
originally show up here,

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.960 align:middle line:10%
they had their own
native garb on-- which

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:10%
was almost like a body suit,
that we would classically

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.920 align:middle line:10%
know of.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And the women had a
tunic that was flowy.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.730 align:middle line:84%
They had flat shoes, very
thin shoes, but flat.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it was more like
what you would imagine

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.320 align:middle line:90%
in a futuristic scenario.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, they had to take
them to the clothing stores

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:90%
and get them all--

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:84%
to the hair salons, and such,
and to the barber and all this

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle line:84%
to get them so that they could
blend easily and walk among us.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Exactly.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
move on then from--

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
so they're giving
Menger messages,

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:84%
they've been looking
after him his whole life.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:84%
They're telling him about
health and well-being.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And in a little bit,
we'll talk about some

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:84%
of the technology
that he discovered

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
when he went on board with
them, and all of these--

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.415 align:middle line:84%
same with Adamski, they
went on board these crafts.

00:17:06.415 --> 00:17:07.665 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Same with Van Tassel.

00:17:07.665 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:84%
He went on-- you
know, and in Italy, we

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.160 align:middle line:84%
had Eugenio Siragusa
that met these people,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and looked exactly like
this, with the body suits

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't they just came
to the United States, they--

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same representation,
whoever saw them at that time

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.699 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: And Adamski and Eugenia
went to all the heads of state

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:90%
to try to change things.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk now,
let's go into Val Thor's time.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
He was over a fair
amount of time

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:84%
he spent here in
the United States,

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.833 align:middle line:84%
and was meeting in
the Pentagon, and was

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
meeting with President
Eisenhower and Vice President

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Nixon.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.568 align:middle line:84%
And this was documented in
Frank Stranges's book, Stranger

00:17:53.568 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
at the Pentagon, and definitely
worth reading, as well.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And this was validated
by Admiral Byrd's nephew.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
At the very beginning
of the book, says,

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
he had top security
clearance, and he witnessed

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.175 align:middle line:84%
Val Thor meeting with
these men, the president,

00:18:11.175 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:84%
vice president did meet
with him, repeatedly.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: And I'll
add one thing, when

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:84%
we were doing our
research, we brought

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:84%
in George Feiler, who had
worked at the Pentagon

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:90%
as a courier under Curtis LeMay.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And George Feiler told me,
and my crew that were there,

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that he was told when he
went to LeMay's office

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.530 align:middle line:84%
that there was a guest in the
cafeteria from another planet.

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:90%
He was told that.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why
I'm even mentioning,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
God bless George Feiler, he
also had contacted as a child,

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
he told me, on
the East Coast, is

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.920 align:middle line:84%
that we need to go back to the
source and get their words.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Not something from
a book or gossip.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.780 align:middle line:84%
When George Feiler tells
me he was told that,

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and he worked for
Curtis LeMay, then

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I know that it is not unusual to
have visitors at the Pentagon.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have the movie
The Day the Earth Stood Still,

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:90%
which is exactly that story.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.122 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly.

00:19:09.122 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you watch
The Day the Earth Stood Still,

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:84%
with the lens that these beings
were actually here giving

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:84%
these messages to humanity at
the time, takes on more import,

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:90%
it makes it more intriguing.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:90%
So he's meeting with--

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Nixon apparently was
very intrigued with what

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.200 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower was apparently
open to these messages,

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:90%
and they were in dialogue.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, you have to
let go of your warring ways,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and stop using your
resources to kill each other.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:10%
This was a big message at
the time, after World War II,

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Exactly.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to stop doing this,

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
bankrupt your planet.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It's going to cause nothing
but geopolitical issues.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Which, look around,
read any headline,

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:84%
any day, we're worse off,
by far, than we were then.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, well, I look
at it as a huge chess game.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we can
win this-- everybody

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.560 align:middle line:90%
has to have nuclear.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.417 align:middle line:84%
So if everybody has
to have nuclear,

00:20:03.417 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:90%
then you're playing chess.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can
win is to do check mate.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Because once one
wins, everybody loses.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't take a rocket
scientist to figure out we're

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.540 align:middle line:84%
on a dangerous
trajectory, or SOS.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So one of the reasons why
I went back to High Bridge

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.098 align:middle line:90%
is to ask for an intervention.

00:20:24.098 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to be honest
with you, the three of us who

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:84%
went back, did a meditation
where Val Thor was, and said,

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:90%
we may need intervention here.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we're in
the same situation

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.643 align:middle line:90%
we were during the Cold War.

00:20:36.643 --> 00:20:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's important
to point out, though,

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that there's been
intervention all along

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
since we've developed
these ridiculous weapons,

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.630 align:middle line:90%
there has been intervention.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't see that playing
out on this planet.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I think we are
coming toward-- you

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:84%
can see the struggle with
the forces trying to keep

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:90%
this military game going.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we're going to
run out of cash, resources,

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:84%
people aren't going to show
up for the wars anymore.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:90%
But until then--

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: I'd love to see that.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to visualize
that scenario.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so
this was told to--

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:84%
this was told to Eisenhower
back in the '50s, right?

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Well,
Eisenhower realized,

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
like I realized
with Colonel Corso,

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.975 align:middle line:84%
that it was in the hands of the
military industrial complex.

00:21:21.975 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
That people were
making money off this.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that made
his speech even more

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:90%
profound, didn't it.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.805 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, because
he said beware of.

00:21:30.805 --> 00:21:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
maybe people didn't

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.610 align:middle line:90%
understand what he was saying--

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.260 align:middle line:84%
beware of the military
industrial complex.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:90%
It is not the government.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.120 align:middle line:84%
It is the black ops that
are running the show.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so Eisenhower,
according to stranger

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.410 align:middle line:84%
at the Pentagon,
Eisenhower's response was--

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:84%
after taking it in,
listening, with him laying out

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:59.870 align:middle line:84%
these potential agendas where
humanity could live a much more

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
healthful existence, we
could use those resources

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.920 align:middle line:84%
for health, well-being,
education, farming,

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.810 align:middle line:84%
clean foods, for
example, they're

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:84%
really big into vegetarian,
clean food diets,

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.330 align:middle line:90%
that was one big message.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower's response to him
was, we've considered it,

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and it would
bankrupt the country

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:84%
if we choose to unplug
from that complex.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.450 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, he
also said that there

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.900 align:middle line:10%
was a pharmaceutical
industry that

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:10%
was an industry that
would go down the tubes,

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:10%
that that was-- that we
had established that.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:10%
We have institutions.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:10%
One of the institutions was
a pharmaceutical institution.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think you agree
that people should

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
read From Outer Space
to You because that

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:53.030 align:middle line:84%
has 30 pages of how you keep
your blood alkaline, of what

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:84%
you should eat, of how you
should live, and purify water,

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:90%
all this kind of stuff.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Those were the words
that the Venutians used

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.710 align:middle line:90%
to help humanity live longer.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand why
we died at such an early age.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They said
we should easily

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:90%
be living to 120, healthfully.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.755 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Well, in
the Bible, they

00:23:13.755 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:90%
lived until hundreds of years.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So how come-- what
happened in between time?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cheetos,
or tasty as they are.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: I mean, so it's
possible, because they said,

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:90%
we're here to help you.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:84%
But when you have an industry
that is built on drugs,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and an industry that's built
on pills, and keeping--

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:84%
for many reasons,
it's an industry--

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower said
about that industry,

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.910 align:middle line:90%
my hands are tied, also.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, so we're talking about a
military, pharma, industrial

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And that is where we are.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.575 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is think back,
even the last couple of years.

00:23:53.575 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Watch
commercials on TV.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Watch the commercials.

00:23:56.283 --> 00:23:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Watch who runs the news.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, and don't think
there's not censorship

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
pharmaceutical industry

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:90%
supporting the news shows.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Of course there is.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And they warned heavily
about that to him.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:84%
They talked about not
taking pills quite a bit.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.743 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Oh, yeah, and
everybody doesn't understand.

00:24:14.743 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when people
tell me, oh, I

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:84%
drink lemon water
in the morning.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, lemons are alkaline.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you-- and in
the book it says,

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.820 align:middle line:84%
cancer is caused by
an acid blood system.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, so if we were to
follow some of this advice--

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:10%
And you know, what's
so amazing, you know,

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:10%
Regina, is that they
gave him milk pods

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:10%
and fruit, as examples of the
fruits they ate, dried fruits,

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:39.290 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:10%
And in the archives I have
that belong to Wendell Stevens,

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.500 align:middle line:10%
there is the actual
envelope that Howard Menger

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.455 align:middle line:10%
sent to the labs to--

00:24:49.455 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I think we have a
photograph of that somewhere.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.523 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, because he had
these things, and he said,

00:24:55.523 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:90%
let's look at what they eat.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what they-- and in
those days, that was research.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When it came
back from the labs.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.593 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, and he actually
did the research about that.

00:25:05.593 --> 00:25:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
was the report?

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.135 align:middle line:90%
Was there anything unusual?

00:25:08.135 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: No, there was--

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.760 align:middle line:90%
we could never get that.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:90%
I'd have to look at--

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You never
saw the results.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: These are photos that
we have of what they gave him.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.010 align:middle line:90%
They even gave him moon rocks.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.153 align:middle line:84%
They gave him--
they did everything.

00:25:21.153 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
They even gave him a
piece of the craft,

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.112 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the problems
started, because then they

00:25:25.112 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:84%
had Howard come to NORAD
at Colorado Springs

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.790 align:middle line:90%
to work for many years.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and so
they-- we were not--

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:84%
no one was able to get
hold of the actual lab

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.222 align:middle line:90%
results of these foods?

00:25:38.222 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: No, would
have loved that.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:84%
But you know something, we
weren't looking at that.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:84%
If I even had this
material 30 years ago,

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:90%
I could have done more work.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can't wait 70 years to
look at the Howard Menger case.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.802 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: And that's
what we ended up doing.

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:84%
But if people, if
researchers had

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
gone after this
in the beginning,

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.280 align:middle line:84%
we would have had more
pieces of the puzzle.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, meanwhile,
back in the day-- now

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:84%
we get into the '50s and
early '60s, Howard was told,

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:84%
he was told from a
young age, you're

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.762 align:middle line:84%
going to be one that shares this
information with the world--

00:26:12.762 --> 00:26:14.090 align:middle line:90%
you and others.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And he actually made it
onto some pretty big media

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.808 align:middle line:90%
venues-- the Jack Paar Show.

00:26:20.808 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: The Jack Paar--
the Arthur Godfrey show.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Arthur Godfrey Show.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.042 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: I used to watch that--

00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:90%
I date back to those days.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I watched Arthur Godfrey
all the time, and Jack Paar.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But little did I
know that in 1953,

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:34.730 align:middle line:84%
when I was in Rhode
Island, this was going

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:90%
on in High Bridge, New Jersey--

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.140 align:middle line:90%
just down the way.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.723 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But these
guys were actually

00:26:38.723 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:10%
brought on to these big,
high-ratings, late-night shows,

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:10%
and daytime shows, and big
syndicated radio shows, too,

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:10%
back in the day to
talk about their story.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.752 align:middle line:90%
And how were they treated?

00:26:51.752 --> 00:26:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Well, you know, it
seemed like it was sensational.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't--
not as dismissive.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Like when Van Tassel was
talking about the Integratron--

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
because the Integratron
was also to--

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
it was a time machine,
he said, but it also

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.580 align:middle line:90%
was rejuvenation of the cells.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So then you wonder-- it
had Tesla coils around it--

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.860 align:middle line:84%
so you wonder, how electrically
you could rejuvenate yourselves

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:90%
so you could live longer.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
message, whether it's

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:84%
on the East Coast
or the West Coast.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:10%
And I think there's
more ridicule,

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.670 align:middle line:10%
there's more ridicule--

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:29.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Today,
there's more ridicule.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: It was
more sensationalism

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:90%
than it was amazing, amazing.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But today, they're
so-- because I

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:84%
think it's mixed in--
real information is

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:90%
mixed in with disinformation.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:41.633 align:middle line:90%
So you can't--

00:27:41.633 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Today, absolutely.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: You can't take
what's real and what's fake.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can't-- unless
you do field research.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Again, going back
to-- and I told you,

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked that the
Historical Society,

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.800 align:middle line:84%
High Bridge, New Jersey, the
regular historical society,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:84%
talking about the 1700s, is
into the Howard Menger case.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:84%
They brought us where
the ships landed.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:90%
They took us there.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:10%
They said, this is a field,
now it's a cornfield.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:90%
But this is where they--

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they
treated it seriously.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: They treat--
it really happened.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:90%
And they don't even discuss it.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like ufology, it's
something that really happened.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.700 align:middle line:90%
Now, the house is empty.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:90%
And so it's easily accessible.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're willing to talk
about-- the historical society

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.330 align:middle line:84%
of New Jersey--
is willing to talk

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:90%
about this on a serious level.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that's more--

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:84%
people were more credulous
in the day, as well.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.155 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
a couple of things.

00:28:41.155 --> 00:28:43.280 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned it at the
very beginning of the show,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and this, I think, is
important, the whole point

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that Yogananda
had really started

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.220 align:middle line:84%
becoming well-known,
transcendental meditation

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:84%
was starting to
come to the fore,

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.250 align:middle line:84%
particularly in
California-- which

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.980 align:middle line:84%
is why I think a lot of
these events happened there.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:84%
There's an open-mindedness and
a youthfulness about the state.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.170 align:middle line:84%
In that day, a lot
of it wasn't even

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:90%
settled till after World War II.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:90%
So Yogananda was there.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And you feel that
these Venutians

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:84%
came because we were opening
our hearts and minds to higher

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:90%
ways of thinking.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Which we called
in those days, the New Age

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:19.690 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Because it started as Werner
Erhardt, Scientology, and all

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:23.750 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.875 align:middle line:90%
Of course it all went--

00:29:24.875 --> 00:29:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Power of positive
thinking, psychocybernetics--

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: A whole
thing, you know.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And the thing-- as
all things on Earth

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.130 align:middle line:84%
go, they go to commercialism,
and sometimes they go south.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they are not as spiritual
as we wanted them to be.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But I want to add one thing
that's very important for me

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.530 align:middle line:84%
as a researcher, I
try to connect dots.

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.693 align:middle line:10%
And I had brought Robert Short
back to Giant Rock to do--

00:29:51.693 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You have to explain
who each of these people is.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Robert Short was
one of the Van Tassel-type

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.990 align:middle line:84%
people, that had had physical
contact with a being-- he was

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:06.950 align:middle line:84%
driving down from Los
Angeles, and the craft landed,

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and the being walked
over to his car.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It's on my YouTube, if people
want to hear his testimony.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, he was
absolutely shocked

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that the being
walked over and said,

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:90%
we have been watching you.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But Robert Short added
another thing-- he said,

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.570 align:middle line:84%
both Van Tassel, and
the early contactees--

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:84%
like Orfeo Angelucci,
and those guys,

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.960 align:middle line:84%
were talking to these
beings on crystal radio.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Until the FBI
jumped in, and said,

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.900 align:middle line:84%
you cannot talk
on this frequency.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And so then, a Van
Tassel and a Robert Short

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:84%
had to use their vocal cords,
because the beings said,

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.130 align:middle line:84%
if we can't talk
on crystal radio--

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to talk through you.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.255 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Can we
talk through you?

00:30:48.255 --> 00:30:52.150 align:middle line:10%
So if you can imagine,
1959, the Giant Rock,

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:10%
30,000 people there
at Joshua Tree,

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.380 align:middle line:10%
and a Van Tassel and
a Robert Short just

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.850 align:middle line:10%
allowing their vocal
cords to be used.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not channeling, because the
voice is completely different.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Because we did it--

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To bring
messages through.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: To bring a message.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, I tie it to the
Amicizia case in Italy--

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:15.998 align:middle line:84%
in 1956, where they were talking
to the beings on crystal radio.

00:31:15.998 --> 00:31:16.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, same.

00:31:16.915 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: I would love to talk
to beings on radio today.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Or some kind of direct talking
to them, like a telephone,

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:27.920 align:middle line:90%
or so forth.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:84%
It was normal
then, in the 1950s.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:31.970 align:middle line:10%
It was normal.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, clarify if
I'm wrong here, Robert Short,

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:41.350 align:middle line:84%
was he the one that knew
the director of "The Day

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.580 align:middle line:90%
the Earth Stood Still?"

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: He knew Robert Wise.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Robert Wise knew
about these messages coming

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:90%
from these beings.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, that
was a disclosure movie.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:90%
And then, what--

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's when kind
of public disclosure happened,

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.180 align:middle line:84%
was with "The Day the
Earth Stood still."

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: The last
part of that movie,

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.170 align:middle line:84%
where the aperture
hits an Impala,

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.103 align:middle line:84%
he said that Michael Rennie
did not have a script for that.

00:32:03.103 --> 00:32:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who was the actor?

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Who was the actor.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:84%
He did not have a
script for that.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So he said to Robert Wise, don't
worry, I'll make something up.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And he channeled
that last message

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.460 align:middle line:84%
to planet Earth-- you
are dangerous people.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.370 align:middle line:10%
We cannot allow you to
come until you have grown

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.420 align:middle line:10%
in your consciousness.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:84%
If you read that, it's
a beautiful, beautiful--

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes it is.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: --monologue.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a monologue.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.940 align:middle line:90%
But Michael Rennie channeled it.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So everyone needs to go
back and watch the movie

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.700 align:middle line:90%
through this lens.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So one is-- so let's go with
the technology for a moment.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:84%
So when Howard Menger
went to board the ships,

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.490 align:middle line:84%
what they did was they sent
out a tiny little scout craft,

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:51.880 align:middle line:84%
little thing, that would
go and measure his vitals,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
look at his levels
of nervousness.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.827 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Like a probe, yeah.

00:32:54.827 --> 00:32:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a probe that
could see even past lives.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It was able to probe
into his entire being,

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and condense all this
information, first of all,

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:07.130 align:middle line:84%
to see if whether he was ready
for this type of experience,

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, it's
really amazing,

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:14.230 align:middle line:10%
because when you have somebody
like a Menger that says that he

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:10%
was taken aboard ship, and you
have an Adamski that has been

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:20.080 align:middle line:10%
taken aboard ship,
and you have--

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:10%
and you have a Billy
Meier that has photographs

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:24.910 align:middle line:10%
of being aboard ship,
of another ship,

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.700 align:middle line:10%
you've got to start tying
these stories together.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel that these
are human-type alien stories,

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and they may be a little bit--

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
there may be a
group of people that

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.760 align:middle line:84%
don't want us to bond with
people that look like us.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.565 align:middle line:10%
So it's easier to
put the whole UFO--

00:33:42.565 --> 00:33:46.180 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We're going to
get into that in a moment.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, the other
technology that they had,

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:53.320 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of like a blue
laser or beam technology,

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.630 align:middle line:84%
where they would
condition him, right?

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Before he'd come into
the craft, otherwise he

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.917 align:middle line:84%
could get sick from the
energies inside the craft.

00:33:59.917 --> 00:34:01.250 align:middle line:90%
So talk about that a little bit.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: They also had
a type of transport,

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:10.870 align:middle line:10%
where you could just--
you became invisible,

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:10%
and then you appeared
and disappeared.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they
had teleportation.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Teleportation, yeah.

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they did.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's something we're
working on right now,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.739 align:middle line:90%
and have been for decades.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, they
had teleportation.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.980 align:middle line:84%
They had given him
an actual machine--

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:32.050 align:middle line:84%
well, they can go on YouTube
because what had happened

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:36.219 align:middle line:84%
is that Howard built a small
UFO that went over county lines.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:90%
It went into Pennsylvania.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.199 align:middle line:84%
The FBI came and said,
don't do that again.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they took him to
NORAD in Colorado Springs

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.500 align:middle line:90%
and had him work there.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And the sad part
about it is they

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:84%
said it's a matter
of national security,

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:56.080 align:middle line:84%
so you're going to need to
say that you deny your story.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And that was very bad.

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And if I didn't have
the picture of him

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and Connie in front
of Condon, I have

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:84%
that photo in front of
Edward Condon in 1969--

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.990 align:middle line:84%
if the story isn't
real, what is he

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.290 align:middle line:84%
doing with opening his book
in front of Edward Condon,

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.728 align:middle line:84%
and the Condon
Committee reports?

00:35:12.728 --> 00:35:14.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Explain who
Condon was, because again--

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:18.610 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: Yes, in
1969, the Air Force

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:22.690 align:middle line:10%
commissioned report
was with Condon

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:10%
in the University of Colorado,
who completely whitewashed

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.630 align:middle line:10%
the whole UFO situation.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this was based
on information from Project Blue

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.900 align:middle line:90%
Book, right?

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.067 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Project Blue Book--

00:35:33.067 --> 00:35:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, if they
can still go find it,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.610 align:middle line:90%
History Channel aired it--

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, maybe on
Netflix or something--

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:40.930 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
fictionalized, it's

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.930 align:middle line:84%
worth going back and looking
at the series, Project Blue

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.513 align:middle line:84%
Book, which Paul Heinicke--
it's a long story,

00:35:46.513 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to go there.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Go to my other interview with
Paola about Project Blue Book.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.203 align:middle line:90%
But that's available now.

00:35:53.203 --> 00:35:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: It's available now.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:10%
Not only that, but
Project Blue Book also

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.550 align:middle line:10%
had the missile shutdown
at Maelstrom, and it so--

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:03.830 align:middle line:10%
and for Condon to just
ignore all of that,

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:07.540 align:middle line:10%
but there is Howard Menger
and Connie in front of him.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there you go.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:09.790 align:middle line:90%
So we've got proof.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:11.270 align:middle line:90%
So they were actually there.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's now move on from that,
because those messages were

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.240 align:middle line:90%
ignored.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.590 align:middle line:90%
We're not living to 120.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:24.250 align:middle line:84%
We're still using billions--
coming up on trillions--

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:29.260 align:middle line:84%
well, globally, trillions of
dollars in precious resources

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.847 align:middle line:90%
on a warring machine, globally.

00:36:30.847 --> 00:36:31.930 align:middle line:90%
We're just-- we're stupid.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Also, we have all
kinds of problems with opioids

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of drugs.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:41.170 align:middle line:10%
Because the problem is
that they just said,

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:46.990 align:middle line:10%
they had a formula for a long
life, which was fairly simple.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Most of them-- most of
the stories I've done,

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.153 align:middle line:84%
they're vegetarians, the
beings are vegetarians.

00:36:52.153 --> 00:36:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And ultimately,
we will be, as well.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:57.250 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of moving that
direction as a species.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And that gets into
a whole other story

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.790 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have
time to go into.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But let's go into what
happened after this.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, we ignored everything,
Eisenhower, everybody

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.280 align:middle line:90%
ignored it.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.270 align:middle line:90%
We did business as usual.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, here we are.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the story
in ufology, itself,

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:15.520 align:middle line:90%
started changing after that.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Once we get into the
'70s, '80s, '90s.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: 1963, the
Betty and Barney Hill

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.500 align:middle line:90%
case just changed everything.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So because I research
it all, I really

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.160 align:middle line:84%
think that the
early days is very

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:84%
interesting-- people should
read, there's so many books.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Daniel Frye
was a physicist,

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and he took a ride in a
spaceship to New York.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And he's a physicist who
worked at White Sands.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.980 align:middle line:90%
He was part of that--

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:84%
they call it Space Brother
movement, whatever.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:48.040 align:middle line:10%
And he then, as a
physicist, scientist,

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:53.360 align:middle line:10%
he starts a group of people
called Understanding--

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.250 align:middle line:10%
Understanding in Arizona.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's a spiritual component
there that there isn't anymore,

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:00.670 align:middle line:90%
as much.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:01.702 align:middle line:90%
It's a spiritual--

00:38:01.702 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And those books
are more unfiltered in what

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:04.840 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yes, because
spirituality would

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.098 align:middle line:90%
have to be linked to this.

00:38:09.098 --> 00:38:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, there
are still some good books

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.940 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And although, as
I said, this field

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:17.140 align:middle line:84%
is very competitive with
people arguing with each other,

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and saying, I'm the only
one with the true story.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.930 align:middle line:84%
But there are some good books
that occur, that can kind of--

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:26.350 align:middle line:84%
I do talk about Nick Pope's
book, Rendlesham Forest,

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:29.262 align:middle line:84%
because it's the anatomy
of how this is covered up.

00:38:29.262 --> 00:38:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a really good
anatomy of a cover-up.

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:32.887 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: And that had
to do with nuclear, too.

00:38:32.887 --> 00:38:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
military bases in England,

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.910 align:middle line:84%
there was an event, joint
British and American.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.930 align:middle line:84%
How this is covered up
from the first moment

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.900 align:middle line:84%
so that the public doesn't
find out the truth of what's

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:48.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's a good one.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.090 align:middle line:84%
But by and large,
the field itself

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.790 align:middle line:84%
seemed to just kind
of disintegrate

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.970 align:middle line:84%
in terms of integrity
on a lot of levels.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Well, also, our
vision of what the alien is--

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had to
go from there, I

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:10.630 align:middle line:84%
had to go from Giant
Rock to the Chilca desert

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:14.685 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, to the Sixto Paz
movement of the Rahma group.

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, so you
started taking it down south.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yeah,
because those guys--

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I've had people say, well,
why did those ETs go down

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:22.923 align:middle line:90%
to Latin America?

00:39:22.923 --> 00:39:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, would you
want to stay here?

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, would you want to stay
here when the government only

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.250 align:middle line:90%
cares about the craft?

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Didn't learn anything about
the philosophy, spirituality,

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:32.980 align:middle line:90%
or anything?

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.720 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't want to come
back to the United States.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:90%
So we don't have that anymore.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.505 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe they
could be around,

00:39:38.505 --> 00:39:40.630 align:middle line:84%
but they're not going to
do it the way they did it.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.930 align:middle line:10%
30,000 people in
Southern California.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So they go to
someplace like Chile,

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:49.570 align:middle line:84%
or they go someplace
like Lima, Peru,

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.227 align:middle line:90%
with the Sixto Paz Rahma group.

00:39:51.227 --> 00:39:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
people are still open.

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.352 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: And they
walk off the ships,

00:39:54.352 --> 00:39:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and talk to Sixto and the
10 boys that were involved.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.520 align:middle line:10%
I talked to his
brother, Charlie,

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.980 align:middle line:10%
he said, yeah, the beings
said, come on, aboard ship.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, I even banged my
arm when I went in the door.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I said, you mean,
you're telling me

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:11.990 align:middle line:84%
that in 1970, you guys saw space
people coming off the ship.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:13.360 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yes.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, Ricardo
Gonzalez who has all those

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.575 align:middle line:84%
encounters with Antrel and
those people in the Andes.

00:40:21.575 --> 00:40:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you go?

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: Yeah, I go--

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I had to go--

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Argentina, Chile.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:27.520 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: I've been to--

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.620 align:middle line:10%
because that's where they went.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they
went, and I'm wondering

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:90%
what the messages are.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And the messages now
have gone to ecology.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.030 align:middle line:90%
You want to save the planet?

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Be careful about
your water sources,

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.480 align:middle line:90%
be careful what you use--

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.440 align:middle line:84%
they've added the
ecological message to this.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.495 align:middle line:90%
So I'm interested--

00:40:47.495 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is, use
your resources more wisely.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Exactly,
so I need to know

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.420 align:middle line:84%
what the messages are so I
have to go to where they're

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.680 align:middle line:90%
coming back to.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot easier
in Latin America,

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.820 align:middle line:84%
because they're
much more accepted.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And the governments there
don't go after craft.

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.772 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even with disclosure
the way we have it,

00:41:04.772 --> 00:41:07.230 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at tic tacs,
we're looking at a craft, nobody

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.152 align:middle line:90%
bothers to say, what's inside?

00:41:10.152 --> 00:41:11.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Who's inside?

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:11.800 align:middle line:90%
What's inside?

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.758 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: What's inside?

00:41:12.758 --> 00:41:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Who's inside?

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Can we look at what's
inside and why they're here?

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, immediately,
we look at it as a threat,

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.373 align:middle line:84%
because they can go
faster and they're

00:41:19.373 --> 00:41:21.900 align:middle line:84%
more maneuverable than
our current technology.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: The speed,
the maneuverability.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, oh, OK.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.420 align:middle line:90%
We got that.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.320 align:middle line:84%
We know they travel in
these kind of craft.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you curious why
they bothered to come?

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, your answer is,
From Outer Space to You.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely,
go back To Outer Space to You.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:middle line:84%
But you also had--
because you do

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.130 align:middle line:84%
go with these various people
who are known to have contact,

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:51.340 align:middle line:84%
you do go out in the field to
these week, week long and even

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.140 align:middle line:90%
longer events.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.322 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: And it's camping.

00:41:53.322 --> 00:41:55.280 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you it's
camping, it's horrible.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But you also had
your own experience

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:58.980 align:middle line:90%
with encountering one of them.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Yes, yes,
I did in Shasta.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which scared the
bejeezus out of you, initially.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Well, it
changes your reality.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can do the work, you
can actually do the work.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm a journalist
is just getting the data--

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I do the work, I
do the work, I do--

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.670 align:middle line:84%
you go to all these places,
you speak to the people.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:17.925 align:middle line:10%
But when you have
your own encounter,

00:42:17.925 --> 00:42:23.370 align:middle line:10%
or your own situation, it
really changes your reality,

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.620 align:middle line:10%
because then you digest it.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.380 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to talk
about it like you and I,

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.780 align:middle line:84%
but when you finally
digest it in your DNA,

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.300 align:middle line:90%
it changes your life.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.225 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
think a lot of people

00:42:35.225 --> 00:42:36.600 align:middle line:84%
don't want to
touch this subject,

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.620 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want
their lives to change.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to be turned
upside down and backwards.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.598 align:middle line:90%
They like it the way it is now.

00:42:44.598 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think that is true.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:48.210 align:middle line:84%
People do not
generally like change.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:49.140 align:middle line:90%
But you're not--

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.683 align:middle line:84%
I know you, Paola, you're
not afraid of change.

00:42:51.683 --> 00:42:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And you have been
going out there.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there is any
other field researcher that's

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:84%
done what you've done,
certainly in our times,

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.290 align:middle line:90%
in the subject of ufology.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: When people go
after the Billy Meier story,

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I feel like saying,
did you go there?

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Did you see what's there?

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a
hole in the trees

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:10.830 align:middle line:90%
there from one of the guns.

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to go
there, you have to--

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And then you have to feel it.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.930 align:middle line:10%
You have to feel
what happened there.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.830 align:middle line:10%
The Swiss government was not
excited about pilgrimages

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:20.820 align:middle line:10%
to his house.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: You know, so
you've got to look at,

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.140 align:middle line:84%
this may have happened, and
maybe the government shut it

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:25.940 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Or you have to look
at all of the stuff.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was also a
human-type alien experience.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
and then you also--

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.920 align:middle line:84%
you wrote the book with
Jacques on the Trinity--

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.100 align:middle line:84%
on Trinity, the Trinity affair
after the nuclear explosion,

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.580 align:middle line:90%
and what happened in New Mexico.

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:43.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA: I know.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've been
involved in so much.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.770 align:middle line:10%
So I just want to say, thank
you for decades and decades

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.050 align:middle line:10%
of boots on the ground research.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:10%
And for dragging me
into it, at times.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: Well, this
was worth it, because--

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.440 align:middle line:84%
this was worth it, Regina,
I'm so glad you read the book.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize
that this gives us hope.

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.940 align:middle line:90%
And also, the Adamski books.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Because those are
being protected also

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.080 align:middle line:90%
by the Stecklings.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, and Fred Steckling,
and now his son Glen Steckling

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:90%
have those archives.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But those are very
interesting, because it

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:25.830 align:middle line:84%
gets into the nature of
anti-gravitational technology,

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.950 align:middle line:84%
how interstellar
space travel occurs

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:33.090 align:middle line:84%
on these currents of
energy out in space.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I just found the
technological part

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:37.890 align:middle line:84%
that Adamski shares
absolutely fascinating when

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:39.360 align:middle line:90%
he was aboard these spacecraft.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.750 align:middle line:90%
So we have those, as well.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are really
good archival documents

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that we can read, if
we're truly interested.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: What interested
me about the Adamski case,

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and what Glen
Steckling said, was

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that there are times in history,
along the timeline, where

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.160 align:middle line:90%
we can make decisions.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And when NASA came
about, and Kennedy

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.060 align:middle line:84%
started that whole
thing, we could

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.580 align:middle line:84%
have gone into outer space
and made a lot of money

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.040 align:middle line:84%
off the spin-offs
of outer space.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to
miniaturize everything,

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.390 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
medical stuff, you

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.260 align:middle line:84%
have to-- there's enough things
that we could have made money

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.570 align:middle line:90%
off and got off the war economy.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.070 align:middle line:90%
It was a time of--

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:22.530 align:middle line:84%
it was like a
choosing of a road,

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and we chose to stay
in the war economy.

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But when you choose to
stay in the war economy,

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:29.160 align:middle line:84%
you've got to
create the enemies.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But the thing is, we--

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.090 align:middle line:90%
people did not choose that.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:36.870 align:middle line:84%
It's been chosen
for us for eons,

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and now we personally have
to take responsibility

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:44.250 align:middle line:84%
for choosing away from that,
psychologically, spiritually,

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:47.640 align:middle line:84%
when we can, disengage from the
businesses that support that.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.660 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us now to
make those decisions.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA: And I hope we have
another fork in the road.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.560 align:middle line:10%
Because we can make money
going into outer space.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.840 align:middle line:10%
We could change the
economy on the planet.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.700 align:middle line:10%
And of course, the
planet runs on economy.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.658 align:middle line:10%
But if we keep going
with the war economy,

00:46:02.658 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:10%
think of all the enemies
we're going to have to create.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:05.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Old story.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.950 align:middle line:90%
So done with that one.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.660 align:middle line:90%
We need to choose better.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:10.778 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Paola.

00:46:10.778 --> 00:46:12.070 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for being here today.

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:13.700 align:middle line:10%
This is a fun story.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And I highly encourage people
to go back and read these books,

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:19.530 align:middle line:84%
so we're talking about
From Outer Space to You.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And then Stranger
at the Pentagon.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And then Adamski's books,
which you can find online.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you
want to add to that?

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.750 align:middle line:10%
>>PAOLA: Nothing,
it's just they'll

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.340 align:middle line:10%
find it fascinating to
go back to the future.

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:34.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.240 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much, Paola.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.830 align:middle line:10%
Please feel free to
go to Paola's site

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:41.790 align:middle line:10%
at PaolaHarris.com really a
shocking array of information,

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:44.550 align:middle line:10%
videos and books on
the topic of contact.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:45.810 align:middle line:10%
She's real deal.

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:49.880 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:55.456 align:middle line:90%
