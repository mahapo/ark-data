00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Welcome, Jerry.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.118 align:middle line:90%
>>JERRY WILLS: Thank you.

00:00:30.118 --> 00:00:32.659 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I've been hoping to
meet you for the last 30 years,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:10%
since I first heard about
you through a person

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:10%
in the triangle that
we know in common.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing, this person

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:84%
who is quite intuitive in their
own right, called me and said,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I met-- at her book
signing-- said,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I met this man named Jerry
Wills, and he's not from here.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:90%
He's from somewhere else.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
time I'd heard her

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:90%
say that about another person.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.889 align:middle line:84%
So now here we are, and we're
going to find out the scoop.

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Certainly.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:90%
What would you like to know?

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I want to
start from the beginning.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.361 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: All right.

00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, your appearance
here on Earth was an odd one.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And your birth certificate
says Fort Knox on it,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of an
interesting certificate.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not something you
would see normally.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So we have plenty
of time to chat.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.465 align:middle line:90%
We have two hours.

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I would love for you to just
tell us about the beginning,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:84%
including as a baby,
even your perceptions.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, you know,
it's so many years ago now.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:10%
But I still have the memories
and I revisit them frequently,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:10%
because I keep trying to make
sense of some of the things

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.640 align:middle line:10%
that I remember that I don't
really have any context

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:10%
to gauge it from.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I've always talked about

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.889 align:middle line:84%
is remembering that there were
two moons in the night sky,

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and that I could
see those two moons.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of my
first memories of life.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
where that comes from,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:90%
but that's what I recall.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I also recall a
woman who was singing

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to me in a language that,
at the time was familiar,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.240 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have any
familiarity with it now.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I can't even recall
the details of it.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:84%
It was just a strange
language-- something

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:90%
beautiful and now foreign.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, past that
point, I remember

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
being in a place that
was cold and dark.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And then bright lights,
the sound of people.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.486 align:middle line:84%
And then it's
about all I recall.

00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:32.776 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When you were a baby?

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, I was a baby.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
are found-- where

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:90%
did they actually find you?

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I don't
remember firsthand.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm told what happened.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
look into this,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:84%
because I want it to be
as honest and detailed

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:90%
as possible, for my own sake.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
If I talk about it, I want it
to be as honest and detailed

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:90%
for the sake of others, as well.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm told is that
the Army Air Corps, because

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:84%
at the time there
was no Air Force,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
they came to retrieve
me out of an abandoned

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:84%
house-- like an old farmhouse
in the middle of nowhere,

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in Kentucky.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How had
they been alerted?

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, that's
the strange thing,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle line:84%
because apparently
they had been.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.245 align:middle line:90%
But there was some project.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:84%
There's this really,
really old fellow

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:90%
I met at a MUFON meeting.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
He was dressed in
his soldier regalia,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:90%
and just-- he very old.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
come and see me,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.338 align:middle line:84%
because of what I was
going to be talking

00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:42.930 align:middle line:84%
about-- a little bit about
what we're talking about today,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
not in as great of detail as
you and I are going to go into.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I just wanted
to meet you shake your hand.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:84%
You're one of those
children, aren't you?

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.080 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, there
was this project.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.442 align:middle line:84%
And he called it
Project Red Light.

00:03:58.442 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Whether that's real
or not, I don't know.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.737 align:middle line:84%
But he says, well--
and we were told

00:04:02.737 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to be dropped off

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:90%
in different places.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And well, it just so happens
you were dropped off where

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I was at, there in Fort Knox.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I came and picked
you up, and you

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:84%
were about-- you
were just about dead,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:90%
you were so cold and frozen.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:84%
And we take you back
to the hospital,

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.516 align:middle line:84%
and then that's the
last we ever saw of you.

00:04:24.516 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was wondering,
well, why in the world would

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.455 align:middle line:84%
they drop off a baby in
the middle of nowhere,

00:04:29.455 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that it took us hours
to get to this place.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So were-- you
don't know who alerted them?

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's still--

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, no.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --unknown at his time?

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.532 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Apparently there was
some-- I'm saying apparently,

00:04:45.532 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:90%
because I really don't know--

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: --these things
I've heard, that there

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:90%
was some plan that was enacted.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And within some framework
of the government's here,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.037 align:middle line:84%
there was this knowing
that these children were

00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
going to be dropped off
in different places.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't the only one.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And that they
would get this message.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's at this
point that we go.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think in my case
they had a 12-hour solve.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.369 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:17.535 align:middle line:90%
And so you were really cold.

00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How old were you?

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Were you a newborn?

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.967 align:middle line:90%
Or a little older?

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I think
I was a little older.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.398 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't newborn at all.

00:05:24.398 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.794 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know how old I was.

00:05:29.794 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
When you take a look at
the birth certificate,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
there's very significant
details missing

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:90%
from that birth certificate.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Such as?

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.509 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I've
looked-- I have children.

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've looked at
their birth certificate,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and I have friends, and
I've looked at theirs.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And they have little
handprints, and footprints,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and details-- mother, father,
occupation, all these things--

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:84%
there are details that
are missing off of mine.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:84%
All of these details
are missing off of mine.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:90%
There's hardly anything there.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.502 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: So why would that be?

00:06:06.502 --> 00:06:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why would that be.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So once you were taken in at
Fort Knox, what do you hear?

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you have
glimpses of memory, what

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:90%
happened to you from there?

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I don't have
glimpses of memory, really.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I remember
is about two years old.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how long
a remained there.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
much about it at all.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.802 align:middle line:90%
I really--

00:06:32.802 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then after two,
I assume you were adopted out

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.965 align:middle line:90%
to a family?

00:06:35.965 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I was adopted out
to a guy who was

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.080 align:middle line:90%
in the services and his wife.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:84%
She was from the same area,
from around Fort Knox,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:90%
and he was from Nebraska.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.795 align:middle line:84%
And the first memories
I have surfacing in

00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
at around two years old or so,
and it's in Denver, Colorado.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, after I
came into their lives,

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.307 align:middle line:84%
he was out of the service, and
a government job was given.

00:07:15.307 --> 00:07:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And they went to Denver, and he
was working for the government

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's where it all kind
of picks up for me again.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your parents
were obviously in the loop.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this wasn't random.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
The selection of
parents was not random.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.315 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: That's true.

00:07:32.315 --> 00:07:35.210 align:middle line:84%
There's something very,
very strange about it all.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:90%
I have two sisters.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And their concern is
now, because we've

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
discovered that our "mother"
couldn't have children.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how did your
sisters appear on the scene?

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.887 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Nobody knows.

00:07:53.887 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They don't know?

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Nuh-uh

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They have
no knowledge of that?

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: No, because
everything was provided

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:84%
to make it look as though
they were legitimately

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:90%
born to her, our mother.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Their birth certificates
are intact, completely.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their story
is nothing like mine.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
You see, what we found out
is that when our mother was

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
a young girl, she was playing
with her sisters with radium--

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:90%
it was used in rat poison.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And they thought it was really
funny to put it on themselves

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:84%
in different places, including
to make their teeth glow.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:90%
They were all sterilized.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:84%
None of them could
have children.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we know that
it wasn't our mother who

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:90%
was really our mother.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.309 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK so-- all right.

00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:50.975 align:middle line:84%
And your dad, obviously
in the military,

00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:84%
so this was contracted
that you would be

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.430 align:middle line:90%
raised by specific individuals?

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: He was also involved
in masonry, as a mason.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
his involvement was.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:90%
He died when I was 7.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:84%
But on several occasions,
two really strange things

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.390 align:middle line:84%
happened that I still
remember quite vividly.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:84%
One of them had to do
with going to Florida

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:90%
and visiting my Uncle Sam.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And we would go
to Daytona Beach,

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:32.445 align:middle line:84%
would drive over there
from Denver-- at least

00:09:32.445 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
I remember, the best I
can, we drove over there.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, my Uncle
Sam would show up.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.549 align:middle line:84%
This was before the
sisters, of course,

00:09:44.549 --> 00:09:46.340 align:middle line:84%
because that was the
second marriage later.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But he would show up
in this big black car.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:90%
It was just huge.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And my dad and I
would get in the car,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and we'd take off driving,
and we'd drive for a ways.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And we'd get into this area
that was like the Everglades.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:05.602 align:middle line:84%
It was just, like, swamplands,
and it was exciting.

00:10:05.602 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time, stories
would be talking back and forth

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.610 align:middle line:90%
in front seat.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.494 align:middle line:84%
I never knew what they
were talking about,

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:84%
because I was looking
out the window, watching

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:90%
for alligators and things.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And then we'd stop.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Down this dirt road,
Uncle Sam would get out,

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
he'd go and lock a gate,
come back, driver us through,

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle line:84%
get back, lock the gate,
drive on some more.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.010 align:middle line:84%
It was like, a sandy
road, it wasn't dirt.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Till we finally
get to this place

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that was almost like the edge
of a pond, but there's no pond.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:90%
It was just a big water area.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:90%
We get into a boat.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:46.726 align:middle line:84%
And now we're on this boat with
this boat motor, putting along.

00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:90%
And I'd done this before.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.595 align:middle line:84%
So the first time
I was really young,

00:10:50.595 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't paying
too much attention.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
This was, like,
six years old now,

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:84%
so I was paying
attention and excited.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:84%
We go to this place, into
these trees, and we stop.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm told, don't
lean over the boat.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:84%
There's alligators out there
and snakes are in the trees.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just like, whoa.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
this man raises up

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:84%
out of the leaves and the
brush, and he has it all over,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%
like it's his costume.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:90%
And they holler at each other.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.300 align:middle line:90%
He has a rifle-- like a gun.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And he reaches up, starts
pulling this thing.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And this looks like a bunch
of weeds, just pulls back.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And we go under it, and
it's dripping on us.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:47.052 align:middle line:84%
And we get on through there,
and he's putting it back down.

00:11:47.052 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Go a little farther,
and there was a clearing

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.110 align:middle line:90%
where we pulled the boat into.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And there are the
guys-- these guys

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
in, what I would
call hazmat suits.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the time, they were just
dressed up weird, head to toe--

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.790 align:middle line:84%
the little windows or
faces are in there.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who was the
hazardous material?

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Me.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, the soldiers
weren't dressed like that,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:90%
the guys with the rifles.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And this one guy always
came out with a doctor,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and always-- I mean, I remember
three instances of this,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.580 align:middle line:84%
so-- he would come
with the doctor,

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
hand me a stick of
Juicy Fruit gum.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go off with
the doctor, and I

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.314 align:middle line:84%
don't remember getting
into anywhere or anything

00:12:41.314 --> 00:12:42.355 align:middle line:90%
that happened afterwards.

00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I would wake up every morning.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm back in the hotel.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.352 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go to the beach.

00:12:51.352 --> 00:12:51.935 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:12:51.935 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:90%
How odd.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.460 align:middle line:84%
How odd that they
allowed your memory

00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:00.162 align:middle line:84%
to even be cognizant of
going into the experience.

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, they just
said that I-- cause I asked,

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:02.953 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

00:13:02.953 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, you just got tired.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.342 align:middle line:84%
And so, after you
chewed your gum,

00:13:07.342 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:90%
you said you wanted to sleep.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So we had business, so
we just let you go ahead

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:90%
and have a nap.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And you slept all the way home.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.839 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would you
assume that they were just

00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:84%
trying to see how
your vitals and how

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:90%
your body was developing here?

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, because the
people in the hazmat suits,

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.395 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they were
the same as regular people.

00:13:26.395 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: There was something
different about them.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.660 align:middle line:84%
They never talked, and
you couldn't really

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.360 align:middle line:90%
see their faces.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.061 align:middle line:84%
They were tall,
like people were.

00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.977 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you're very tall.

00:13:35.977 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're, what,
6' 8" or something?

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, 6' 9".

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.907 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 6' 9", right.

00:13:40.907 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But I wasn't
then, of course.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.023 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, of course.

00:13:43.023 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I was
just a little guy.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just pointing
out, you're from a tribe of--

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: But everybody was tall.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.108 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --very tall beings.

00:13:47.108 --> 00:13:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.286 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And these
guys were tall.

00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:53.732 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they were in hazmat
suits because it was buggy,

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:55.565 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't want
to get bit by anything.

00:13:55.565 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these are-- so
you're starting to-- you're

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:84%
not really putting any
pieces together just yet.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:84%
You're just having
weird experiences.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.133 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:14:05.133 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you
were visited by--

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I was.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
--extraterrestrial beings.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It was about same time,
about five or six years old,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:84%
there was an incident where I
came in contact with something

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:90%
very strange.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
That at the time, it
was, like, frightening,

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.940 align:middle line:90%
and then it was, like, fun.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened is that
I had one of the childhood

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:84%
diseases-- I don't know if
it was mumps, or measles,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:90%
or what it was.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.457 align:middle line:84%
But I remember I had a
really high temperature,

00:14:38.457 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't feeling well.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And normally I
wouldn't get sick,

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:84%
but this was really
making me ill.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I was sleeping on the couch that
pulls out and makes into a bed,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:90%
and that was in the living room.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And my toys, one of them
was a record player,

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.260 align:middle line:84%
with "The Cat and
the Fiddle" record.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:90%
A lot of kids had those things.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:84%
My parents were in the
bedroom at the other end

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.250 align:middle line:90%
of the house we lived in.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And I remember not
feeling well at all.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly that record player
started up, and I woke up.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And there were
these four or five

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:84%
white-- they're not really
tall, but they were tall enough.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Now I would say
they're not the grays,

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
but they're the big
bluish white ones.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
called the Tall Whites--

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.693 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:15:33.693 --> 00:15:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --I think
in these circles.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Maybe so.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But they were
there, and they were

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:90%
coming to make me feel better.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So here I'm watching
this, like this cartoon--

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:84%
"The Cat and the Fiddle," and
all these things-- and I'm

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
really distracted while
they're there touching,

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and little stick
things touching onto me

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and making little
noises back and forth.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And all this is going on,
and finally the whole thing

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:90%
is ended.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, look
at me, go, "sleep."

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And I slept.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.612 align:middle line:84%
I woke up the next
morning, and I was

00:16:10.612 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:90%
like, I had this great dream.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.942 align:middle line:90%
It was so amazing.

00:16:12.942 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to play that
record over and over again.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.816 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:15.816 --> 00:16:18.369 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: But it wasn't a dream.

00:16:18.369 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And the
little red spots,

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:84%
where they touched me with
the stick in different places,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:90%
those were itchy.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it was
I had, they were

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.515 align:middle line:84%
very interested in
how I was managing.

00:16:30.515 --> 00:16:32.935 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I wasn't
managing it very well,

00:16:32.935 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:90%
and they showed up to do that.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:84%
There were people,
periodically, who

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:84%
showed up at our house, who
were dressed in uniforms.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.855 align:middle line:84%
Like if you watched
a movie and saw

00:16:42.855 --> 00:16:46.782 align:middle line:84%
a General, and all the regalia,
and the hat, and the whole bit.

00:16:46.782 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And they were telling
me, oh, well you're

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:84%
going to be in the
Air Force Academy,

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to be an officer,

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to this and this,

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.945 align:middle line:90%
and we have big plans for you.

00:16:59.945 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And back when I
was six years old,

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.955 align:middle line:84%
my father took me to
a place in Denver.

00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
this place is.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:90%
We were living in Denver.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.955 align:middle line:90%
And we took an elevator down.

00:17:15.955 --> 00:17:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask you, was
it above or underground.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It was underground.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It was like a huge
movie theater.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And all these people, out
there in the darkness-- and I

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
was really nervous
about it-- they

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:84%
made me put on this outfit
that was like a one piece--

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
well, now I'd call
it a Lycra suit,

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:84%
because we have things like
that we're familiar with.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.416 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I didn't
know what Lycra was.

00:17:41.416 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:84%
It was like a one-piece thing
that was very form-fitting.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And all these people were
just congratulating my father

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:90%
and talking to him.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.190 align:middle line:90%
And this was backstage.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I walked
out-- I was told

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.972 align:middle line:84%
to walk out onto the stage,
and to say these words.

00:18:03.972 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
what the words were,

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.830 align:middle line:90%
but I was six years old.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:90%
It was 55 years ago.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But I did, and the
whole place just was clapping.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.311 align:middle line:90%
It was like, oh, it was so good!

00:18:21.311 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Yay!

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And so, I felt
real good about it,

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:90%
like I'd done well.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.757 align:middle line:84%
So I got a stick
a Juicy Fruit gum.

00:18:27.757 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:90%
They knew your passion.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: They did.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Actually it's pretty good.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But what that was all
about, I haven't got a clue.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:84%
It was the strangest thing
when you think back on it.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Why did I have to
dress in this thing?

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And what was it I said
that made them so excited?

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And all these people
came up in long lines

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.045 align:middle line:84%
to come by and kneel
down, and shake my hand,

00:18:53.045 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and pat me on the
shoulder, and say things.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.726 align:middle line:84%
We're real proud of you, son,
we're glad that you're here.

00:18:59.726 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as time
went on-- first of all,

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask you something
about the Tall Whites.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:90%
What was their countenance like?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.463 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: They were like,
rather indifferent.

00:19:11.463 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And it really follows suit with
my experiences later in life

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: They've
shown up a few times.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- almost like
dealing with Spock in "Star

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Trek"-- very to the point,
no jokes, no goofing around,

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and not really any sound, just
funny clicking noises and such.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.375 align:middle line:90%
But they were very powerful.

00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:84%
You could hear
them in your head.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And that's how I always
heard them when I was younger

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and in years on
farther down the road.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.287 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very different
than the Little Grays.

00:19:55.287 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Grays are much
more malicious-- much more,

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:90%
they are malicious.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
those blue-white beings

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:90%
are malicious at all.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.477 align:middle line:84%
I never got that
impression from them.

00:20:06.477 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
did encounter Grays?

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, yeah.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, what
was that experience

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:84%
like considering
you-- we're going

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to get to the point of where
you came from and after this.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I
encountered the Grays,

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:90%
it was much later in life.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.957 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
I was interfering.

00:20:23.957 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interfering with what?

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: With what they
were doing to people.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:84%
There are things going
on that I found out

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.110 align:middle line:84%
about that I wasn't
too keen to know.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And because you know
something's wrong,

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.507 align:middle line:84%
then either you take action
against it or you don't.

00:20:40.507 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, then
you're in agreement with it

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.500 align:middle line:90%
if you know what's going on.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't be in agreement
with it, so I took a stand.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were these
some of the things

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that people in this community
would already know about?

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Or do care to just
give two or three

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.474 align:middle line:84%
examples of what they were
up to that you objected to?

00:20:55.474 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I'm sure the
people in this community

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:84%
would know something
about these things,

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.070 align:middle line:84%
but maybe not know
the details I know

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.360 align:middle line:84%
unless they heard me talk
at some-- cup of coffee

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.019 align:middle line:90%
in casual setting.

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not the things I
really talk about too much,

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.839 align:middle line:84%
because it scares people, and
I don't like scaring people.

00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But I
will tell you this.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.010 align:middle line:84%
What are these little
gray guys are doing--

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
working alone-- they're

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.850 align:middle line:84%
harvesting people and
things from this world.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:84%
You've heard people
that said, oh, well,

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I got pregnant
and then I wasn't.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed a person
or two that-- yeah.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And you know,
cattle mutilations,

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.435 align:middle line:84%
and things like this,
well, what you don't know,

00:21:45.435 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is there are a lot of people
who are just flat out missing.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:90%
People just vanish.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And you hear stories
about oh, well, we're

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:84%
having these gray guys
show up, and they're

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:90%
doing this and taking samples.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to be
following family lineages.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of folks are trying
to figure out why that is.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because they
are populating other worlds

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:84%
with the people
they take from here.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
genetic traits

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:84%
that they have
tagged into people,

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.240 align:middle line:84%
or tracked into people-- tracked
into them, tracked of them,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I should say more
appropriately--

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're following
family lines.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And this woman has
exactly what we need,

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:90%
but we don't need it yet.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Her daughter, probably not.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Her daughter's son
does, and that child,

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
as a result has what we're
looking for, we can harvest.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is
get this gal pregnant,

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:90%
and we can take what we need.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And you hear people talk about,
oh, I saw my hybrid baby.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: That's
what's happening.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm sorry, you can't
take it home with you,

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.180 align:middle line:90%
because it can't live on Earth.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.050 align:middle line:84%
They've modified it to
the point to where it

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.258 align:middle line:90%
can live on this other world.

00:23:14.258 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And these people on this other
world look at these beings

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:90%
as though they're god.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.860 align:middle line:90%
They don't know any different.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:90%
They present themselves as gods.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:90%
They can go into your mind.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
They can make you
see whatever it

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:84%
is you want to see-- anything
that they want you to see,

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:90%
they will.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:33.413 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Known to be highly telepathic in
their abilities with telepathy.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: They create
hallucinations,

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:90%
walking hallucinations.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:84%
They become gods to
these people that

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:84%
have been taken to these other
worlds, out among the stars,

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and these people don't
know any different.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:54.097 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So they live in
a type of enslavement.

00:23:54.097 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And who knows whether they'll
ever get out of it or not.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.971 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:56.971 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go to
where you came from.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you now know
where you were from.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I do in a way.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.164 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how sure could I be?

00:24:08.164 --> 00:24:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But as sure, for
myself, that I could be,

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:90%
let's say.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
from this other place,

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.809 align:middle line:84%
and there are a lot of
human characteristics.

00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.683 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, there are
people like ourselves

00:24:19.683 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:90%
all among the stars.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The Earth is
not unique in having

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:90%
people who look like us.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.695 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.695 --> 00:24:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I come from
this other place.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.695 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was told.

00:24:32.695 --> 00:24:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't told this by
government officials or people

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:90%
from this world.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I was told by the people who
came here when I was younger,

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted
to show me things,

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.540 align:middle line:84%
they want me to be
well-versed in life here.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole
idea was, instead

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.580 align:middle line:84%
of them interfering with
progress of this world--

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and they'd already
tried that in ages past,

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to try and maneuver
or suggest, probably

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
even manipulate in some ways, a
direction for social thinking.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And instead of doing that,
because it didn't work,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:84%
what they were trying
to do this time

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:84%
was to take representatives
from these other elements

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:84%
where humankind exist, and bring
them here with things intact so

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:84%
that they could be a
part of this world,

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and to have a right
to say something.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Because they grew up here, live
here, this is our neighborhood,

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and we don't like
what's happening,

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:48.210 align:middle line:84%
so we can say
something about it,

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:90%
and we can do it with impunity.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And if people listened,
fine, if they don't, fine.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't the
extraterrestrials

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:84%
who are coming
down saying, you've

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.832 align:middle line:90%
really screwed up your planet.

00:25:58.832 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Look, you need to do
something different.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:00.696 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:00.696 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:84%
They say to you, these
little guys, you're of this.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.665 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:26:03.665 --> 00:26:07.515 align:middle line:84%
But we also came in with
certain talents and abilities.

00:26:07.515 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't the only one.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.250 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
others out there as well.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So our goal was to just
point in a direction.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Say, you know,
there's another way.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.460 align:middle line:84%
But in order for
us to do that, we

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:84%
needed to have some
background beyond what we

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:84%
brought with us in our memories
that were at least somewhat

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.320 align:middle line:90%
intact.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that,
they showed up for me,

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and they started giving
pieces of information.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And it went on for
a number of years--

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:84%
little bits of this,
little bits of that.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:84%
We all have our little abilities
or things that we're good at.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Some people are great with
chemistry and rocket science,

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and others are good at
sociology and psychology.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Mine happened to be in
electronics and understanding

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:14.860 align:middle line:84%
the fabric of space, the nature
of this, and being able to see.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
We all came in with
the ability to see,

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:90%
see beyond just normal sight.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of folks call
that being psychic.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.190 align:middle line:90%
It's just normal out there.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just, woo,
it's special here.

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:28.009 align:middle line:84%
Churches didn't want
us to have that.

00:27:28.009 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.896 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to the
churchiness part of it

00:27:30.896 --> 00:27:32.159 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit here.

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Woo.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which I find
absolutely hysterical,

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:35.610 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
What about the
emotional structure

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:84%
of the beings from where you're
from, and then integrating here

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:84%
with the highly-reactive
emotional field

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:90%
of this species?

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, that is quite
the story in itself, isn't it?

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.504 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm asking,
because you're unflappable.

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anyone who's met
you feels that you're

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:90%
basically unflappable.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't seem to react in
the normal emotional ways

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:90%
that most people do.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, when
you take a look

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and consider the emotional
structure of the people who

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:84%
are out there, they see
themselves much differently

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:90%
than the people here do.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean
by that is a level

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:27.460 align:middle line:84%
of being centered and present,
being aware, and being

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:90%
at peace.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:84%
If you have these, then you
have a level of confidence

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.500 align:middle line:90%
that you can exist from.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Successful living requires
living confidently.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Confidently means you're
aware, you're present,

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:47.800 align:middle line:84%
you're at peace, you're
thinking, breathing.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:84%
But these other gifts
that are present,

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:54.840 align:middle line:84%
these psychic
abilities, expand far

00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:00.400 align:middle line:84%
beyond the surface of your body,
and you're tap into that too.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So before you ever meet someone,
you can tell what's going

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:84%
on with them, whether you
like them or you don't.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, there are
extraterrestrials that I've

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.025 align:middle line:84%
met, didn't
particularly care for.

00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That look like we do?

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: That look like we do.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So having
those senses in place

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:84%
just means that you're living
a very enriched state of being

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
that's fed by
everything around you.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why it
works like that, for them,

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.689 align:middle line:84%
is because that
is their religion.

00:29:39.689 --> 00:29:40.230 align:middle line:90%
If you were--

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.188 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That balance.

00:29:41.188 --> 00:29:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It is.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:45.056 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we have religions
here where, oh, I'm a this

00:29:45.056 --> 00:29:48.180 align:middle line:90%
or I'm a that.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Religions here require that
you join the exclusive club,

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and then you can be whatever
the religion says you might be.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Out there, religion
is being present

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that if you're
going to look for god,

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:90%
you need to look in a mirror.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Because wherever
you go to find god

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:84%
is secondary to looking
within yourself,

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.690 align:middle line:90%
because god lives here first.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere
else, you can then

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:84%
see the presence of the
divine-- including other people.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:10%
And it's in that philosophy that
finding the divine in others

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.807 align:middle line:10%
allows you to celebrate life
within yourself, because you

00:30:35.807 --> 00:30:37.640 align:middle line:10%
see it in everyone else
and everything else,

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:10%
whether it's a chair or a tree.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And the planet-- and you
start caring about things

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:84%
much differently when
you do things like that.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But when you're involved
with organized religion,

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.430 align:middle line:84%
you have a much different
state of affairs

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.605 align:middle line:90%
and different operating dynamic.

00:30:55.605 --> 00:30:58.180 align:middle line:90%


00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:59.481 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:59.481 --> 00:30:59.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's just
talk about, then,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:84%
the fabric of dealing with all
of the very highly-intensified

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:84%
emotions of this planet for you,
as a different kind of being.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.300 align:middle line:90%
How has that worked?

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It
certainly rattles me.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the emotions
here are basically

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.360 align:middle line:84%
a part of-- well I mean,
everyone here I know has it.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.557 align:middle line:84%
And I've tried to have a lot
of it too, because I'm here.

00:31:25.557 --> 00:31:27.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, give me a cigarette
and a cup of coffee,

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.973 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be an Earth person.

00:31:28.973 --> 00:31:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.585 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But these
heightened emotions,

00:31:34.585 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:84%
they serve a person's
state of being,

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.480 align:middle line:84%
because it allows
your ego to be fed,

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:84%
it allows your
intellect to erase,

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.430 align:middle line:84%
it gets the heartbeat
up, or it gives you

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot of fear-- either way
your heartbeat goes up.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And how do you deal
with the people here?

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, you live within
it so you understand it.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you get beyond it
so that you can survive it.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I've met several
extraterrestrials.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And they can't handle
it for very long,

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.435 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
grow up here.

00:32:08.435 --> 00:32:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them, this
is the sort of thing

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.980 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
have been born here

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.410 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able
to cope with this,

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.340 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise,
it'll make you nuts.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And this one fellow, Rich,
says I don't understand how

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.425 align:middle line:90%
you can take it for so long.

00:32:24.425 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:90%
And I said, it's why I smoke.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's smoking do?

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.410 align:middle line:84%
As a non-smoker, what
does that do for you

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.110 align:middle line:84%
in terms of managing
the emotions of this?

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It makes me happy.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I know that's
a very ambiguous answer.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:40.871 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:32:40.871 --> 00:32:42.870 align:middle line:90%
But that's good enough.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:46.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what I wanted to get
to-- because you were talking

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:84%
about religion a moment ago--
is now, through your childhood,

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.390 align:middle line:90%
you're given information.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:51.014 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:32:51.014 --> 00:32:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can see.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You also have
quite a bit of energy that's

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.341 align:middle line:90%
at your disposal to work with.

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:56.881 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:32:56.881 --> 00:32:59.066 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And healing is
part of that energy, right?

00:32:59.066 --> 00:32:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, it is.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So all this is
available to you, all

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:84%
under the spectrum of
electricity, energy,

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.730 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.869 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
fast forward a bit,

00:33:08.869 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:84%
unless there's some
critical piece in there

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:84%
that you want to tell us
about, to the time when you're

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:19.510 align:middle line:84%
a teenager, and now you have a
friend or a girlfriend who has

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.356 align:middle line:90%
invited you into the church.

00:33:21.356 --> 00:33:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, there really wasn't--

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.876 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The church study
group or whatever it was.

00:33:24.876 --> 00:33:28.082 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: This is past
the point of-- well,

00:33:28.082 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's late teens,
probably, around 18, 19.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.109 align:middle line:90%
It was my cousin and she was--

00:33:34.109 --> 00:33:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, not a girlfriend.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.155 align:middle line:84%
So you're in the Bible
Belt in Kentucky.

00:33:37.155 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:41.414 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your cousin
is involved with a religion.

00:33:41.414 --> 00:33:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's
called a Lighthouse.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.670 align:middle line:84%
It's an evangelist
group, and it was

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:51.870 align:middle line:84%
designed to bring the children--
bring kids our group age in,

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:84%
teens to early 20s-- and instead
of the devil weed-- smoking

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:90%
pot-- and drinking, find god.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And my cousin was,
like-- she was real doer.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.350 align:middle line:84%
She was doing things
I would never do.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:14.599 align:middle line:84%
So one day I met her, and she
was all blissful and happy

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:15.915 align:middle line:90%
and hm-hm-hm.

00:34:15.915 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what
happened to you?

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I found god, and
I'm very happy now.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:21.659 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, where is this at?

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So she told me, and I wanted
to find out what it was.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Because she's talking about,
oh, they're talking in tongues,

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing
miracles and healings.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.416 align:middle line:90%
And that keyed me in.

00:34:33.416 --> 00:34:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.575 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Because I'd already
been working on animals.

00:34:35.575 --> 00:34:37.449 align:middle line:84%
And there had been
a couple of people,

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:41.170 align:middle line:84%
but it scared most
folks, so I didn't do it.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:84%
There was no way of explaining
what I do to people.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.469 align:middle line:84%
There was no vocabulary for it,
and suddenly here was a place,

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:90%
maybe there was.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So I went, and they had a
volleyball game going on.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not fair
with you on anybody's team.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.040 align:middle line:90%
You just stand at the net.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:03.620 align:middle line:90%
So I was having fun.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, this
volleyball jammed my thumb,

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:10.776 align:middle line:84%
knocked it backwards,
and it hurt really bad.

00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.355 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Holy mackerel.

00:35:12.355 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.650 align:middle line:90%
I used to play volleyball.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:14.680 align:middle line:90%
I've had a jammed thumb.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.480 align:middle line:90%
It hurts.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And so, I'm like going, oh!

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had had this before,
so I knew what had happened.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.940 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a mystery,
but I knew it was

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.496 align:middle line:90%
going to hurt for a long time.

00:35:25.496 --> 00:35:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And this guy that was the
head of this organization

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:33.560 align:middle line:84%
came over and says, god will
take that away from you.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm busy trying
to regenerate it myself.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, really?

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Jesus will.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.530 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.680 align:middle line:90%
He says, watch.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Puts his hands in there,
and he says, Jesus--

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and starts talking to Jesus,
up in the air somewhere.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And said, uh, uh, and then,
boom, takes his hand off.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.080 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, how is it?

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I was like, well,
I'll be going to hell.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.030 align:middle line:90%
It works just fine.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.730 align:middle line:84%
That's cool, that somebody
else is doing what I do.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:05.210 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted to stick around.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So I started using
the same words

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.840 align:middle line:84%
they use, the same
phrasisms-- you

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:84%
had to say things a
certain way or you

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.720 align:middle line:90%
weren't part of this club.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And I joined in.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.725 align:middle line:84%
Well, before you know it,
there are people coming through

00:36:20.725 --> 00:36:22.780 align:middle line:84%
with broken this,
and injured that,

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and not doing well
here or there.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just doing what I
do-- I'm just fixing them.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:33.549 align:middle line:84%
He gets back to the church
that was sponsoring this.

00:36:33.549 --> 00:36:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And people were going, wow, you
know, Jerry's doing miracles,

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.980 align:middle line:90%
big time.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And this guy wanted to see
me, the head of the church.

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:90%
So I got called to the office.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:84%
A little nervous, because I've
always liked to have long hair,

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
my favorite jeans
were bell-bottoms,

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and my favorite music
was rock and roll.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And I always had some sort
of necklace of some sort.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:04.250 align:middle line:84%
At the time it was in the period
of love beads-- I liked that.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:08.909 align:middle line:84%
So I walk into this
office in this church.

00:37:08.909 --> 00:37:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't even remember
what kind of church--

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.150 align:middle line:84%
it was a Methodist
church, I think.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And it has wood
everywhere, carpeted floor.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It's fancy-- books all over the
bookshelves, great big window,

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and a huge desk, and this
guy that looks like somebody

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.490 align:middle line:90%
important is behind it.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:33.220 align:middle line:84%
He stands up, shakes my hand,
and I feel really out of place,

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.100 align:middle line:84%
because I'm dressed
basically like a hippie.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.040 align:middle line:90%
I liked hippies.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.810 align:middle line:90%
I thought they were cool.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:42.979 align:middle line:84%
So I sit down in this
pretty stiff chair.

00:37:42.979 --> 00:37:44.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
is in Kentucky, where

00:37:44.645 --> 00:37:45.530 align:middle line:90%
there weren't a lot of hippies?

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: In Kentucky.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, there weren't any.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:48.396 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I was trying to be one.

00:37:48.396 --> 00:37:49.565 align:middle line:90%
I thought it would be fun.

00:37:49.565 --> 00:37:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Got ya.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So he proceeds to tell
me there is a lot about me,

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and all these things that I've
done-- all these healings--

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and they've been
watching me very closely.

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:05.472 align:middle line:84%
And they want to send
me to seminary school.

00:38:05.472 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know what that is.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.485 align:middle line:90%
So he explains it.

00:38:08.485 --> 00:38:11.130 align:middle line:90%


00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.420 align:middle line:90%
I could have plenty of money.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:19.925 align:middle line:84%
I would have a nice car
and beautiful women,

00:38:19.925 --> 00:38:21.470 align:middle line:90%
and I'd be very famous.

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds
like recruitment

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:25.865 align:middle line:90%
for college football.

00:38:25.865 --> 00:38:26.406 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:38:26.406 --> 00:38:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And all I had
to do was cut my hair,

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:36.400 align:middle line:84%
put on this suit-- he had it
hanging right over there--

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.370 align:middle line:84%
and wear those shoes--
get rid of the sandals,

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and get rid of the love
beads, and-- well, basically

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:46.280 align:middle line:90%
become someone else.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't drink beer anymore,
I couldn't smoke pot anymore--

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:84%
not that I was smoking
it that much anyway.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I just discovered it,
I thought it was fun.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:57.210 align:middle line:90%
You know, 18, 19 years old.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: And rock and roll?

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.230 align:middle line:90%
No, no more of that.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:03.870 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go
in to this school.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.660 align:middle line:84%
He's says, well, because that's
what god wants you to do.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.140 align:middle line:90%
You were born to be a healer.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.130 align:middle line:90%
You have the gift.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And god want you
to do blah, blah.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said, really,
you think so?

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.240 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'm certain of it.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well then, why
is it working right now,

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:29.370 align:middle line:84%
with me doing things
the way that I am?

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And you think god
will like it better

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not doing these
things, and dressing

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.960 align:middle line:84%
like you want me to
dress, and giving up

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.620 align:middle line:90%
the things make me happy?

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I had to quit smoking, too.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.290 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, that's
just how it works.

00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't think
your god is the same god

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:50.450 align:middle line:84%
that I believe in,
because my god likes me

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.340 align:middle line:90%
just the way that I am.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as he
tells me in some way

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that I need to change, and dress
like that, or do these things,

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.450 align:middle line:90%
then I'll change.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:06.340 align:middle line:84%
But until then, your
god is not real to me.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Oh, he got really upset
and told me to leave.

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.295 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:40:12.295 --> 00:40:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I went out and had a
cigarette and walked home.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now the next
decade, things kind of

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.090 align:middle line:84%
got quiet for you
for a little while?

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: They did.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.923 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had an
extraordinary experience,

00:40:22.923 --> 00:40:24.759 align:middle line:84%
again, where this
healing thing comes in?

00:40:24.759 --> 00:40:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about that,

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.190 align:middle line:84%
because that was really a
critical turning point in life.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.110 align:middle line:90%
1980?

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So I basically-- it was
difficult to be accepted,

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:37.650 align:middle line:84%
because I could
see things be-- we

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.850 align:middle line:84%
call it psychic, as
I mentioned earlier--

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.710 align:middle line:84%
all these different things that
I could do were not acceptable,

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't really a
vocabulary where you can even

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:90%
talk to people about it.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.480 align:middle line:84%
You talk about psychics and you
get all these hushed whispers

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.880 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh, psychics, must
be of the devil.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.210 align:middle line:90%
So I just abandoned it.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:00.790 align:middle line:90%


00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Went through a marriage, got a
divorce, ended up in Phoenix,

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:12.117 align:middle line:84%
and I basically just
shelved the whole thing.

00:41:12.117 --> 00:41:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just going
to be a human here.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.366 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Just going
to be a human.

00:41:15.366 --> 00:41:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
that means exactly.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, holidays are so foreign
to me, and I grew up here

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.560 align:middle line:90%
and they still are.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, here I am in 1980.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I have my background
in electronics,

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.990 align:middle line:90%
and I'm really good.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm up in the top
of this airplane hangar,

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.540 align:middle line:84%
installing this
communication system.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So how many feet up?

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.335 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I don't know,
couple hundred, maybe 150.

00:41:43.335 --> 00:41:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I really don't--
it was really high.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Big, big
building, yeah.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It was quite high.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well anyway,
I was up there,

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and because this
company I was working

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:84%
for had bought cheap
materials, relays--

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I wanted the ones that
cost a dollar more-- well,

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:06.070 align:middle line:84%
they didn't spring for those,
and I put the cheap relays in,

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.840 align:middle line:84%
because that's all they
would get, the relay failed.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm way up
there in these rafters,

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to pull out
this card-- because I

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:18.910 align:middle line:84%
have to put in a new
relay, another cheap one--

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and the platform breaks,
because they had some guy build

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.065 align:middle line:90%
a platform cheap.

00:42:26.065 --> 00:42:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Out of
cheap materials, yeah.

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Uh-huh.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:30.390 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that wasn't
cheap was a huge steel chest

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:33.310 align:middle line:90%
that was sitting on it.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And I fell, and the
huge steel chest fell.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And the thousands of feet of
wires that were strung out

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.282 align:middle line:84%
from this chest, going to
all corners of this place,

00:42:44.282 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:84%
was the only thing that
kept it from crushing me,

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:52.820 align:middle line:84%
because this cable was
like eight inches around.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I started falling.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:43:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And-- well, I don't know
if you want me to go

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.820 align:middle line:90%
into the death part of it.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, sure.

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, as I'm falling,
the next thing that happens

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.110 align:middle line:90%
is that I'm no longer falling.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I am living through the
eyes of others-- the people

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:84%
that I'd either been kind to
or had not been so kind to.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.890 align:middle line:84%
When you're growing
up, you do things

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.930 align:middle line:84%
that are a little
shady sometimes

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:24.590 align:middle line:90%
and wish you hadn't done them.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
circumstance,

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.755 align:middle line:84%
I was experiencing
me through the eyes,

00:43:29.755 --> 00:43:32.710 align:middle line:84%
through the heart and the
emotions of the people

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:36.580 align:middle line:84%
that I had provided the
experience of being around me,

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.040 align:middle line:90%
had provided them.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
wasn't pleasant.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.119 align:middle line:84%
And all the healing things that
I had missed out on, I just

00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:47.410 align:middle line:84%
regretted all times are could
have done something and I

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:47.910 align:middle line:90%
didn't.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I regretted-- basically,
it was a lot of regret.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm just sitting--
I don't know how I'm sitting,

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.310 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just floating
up in the air,

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.110 align:middle line:84%
just sort of in a
sitting position,

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:03.160 align:middle line:84%
it seemed-- looking down at
my body, there on the ground,

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.350 align:middle line:90%
50 feet below me.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:09.066 align:middle line:90%
And a voice says, Jerry.

00:44:09.066 --> 00:44:12.180 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, yeah?

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.790 align:middle line:90%
"What are you doing here?"

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:15.857 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:44:15.857 --> 00:44:17.020 align:middle line:90%
[SCOFFS]

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.350 align:middle line:90%
--I died.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.270 align:middle line:90%
"No.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:23.980 align:middle line:90%
You can't stay here."

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't know.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty dead, I think I will.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.870 align:middle line:90%
"No, you can't stay here.

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:32.190 align:middle line:90%
You have to go back now!"

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was like being
blown out of a cannon.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It was just pew!

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm back in my
body and I'm hurt.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ow.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:41.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:42.680 align:middle line:90%
How hurt?

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Very hurt.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.830 align:middle line:84%
I had a hole in my right
hand and broken this that

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:49.880 align:middle line:90%
and the other.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:50.979 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Spine?

00:44:50.979 --> 00:44:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, the
spine was messed up.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.781 align:middle line:90%
Everything was messed up.

00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:56.594 align:middle line:90%
And I was trying to breathe.

00:44:56.594 --> 00:44:57.635 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't quite breathe.

00:44:57.635 --> 00:44:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
say, what happened

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.000 align:middle line:84%
to your internal organs
with that kind of impact?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No idea.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I was lying flat on my back,
remember seeing myself there.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:08.150 align:middle line:84%
My tennis shoes-- Kathy
says it sounds stupid,

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.750 align:middle line:84%
but really, I mean, the tennis
shoes were blown off my feet.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:11.427 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:45:11.427 --> 00:45:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I don't know how.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.801 align:middle line:90%
They were just, like, shredded.

00:45:13.801 --> 00:45:16.010 align:middle line:90%


00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:18.895 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up in
an ambulance, and I

00:45:18.895 --> 00:45:20.260 align:middle line:90%
have vague memories of that.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.885 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I know,
I'm in the hospital,

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and they had done whatever
they do there-- X-rays, MRIs,

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.610 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I have this big
bandage on my hand,

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm all strapped down to a
board, a thing around my neck,

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.550 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not supposed to move.

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting more
and more conscious,

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.150 align:middle line:90%
and I don't feel bad at all.

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:42.930 align:middle line:90%
I feel pretty okey dokey.

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:45.610 align:middle line:90%
So there's nobody around.

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So I just-- well, the
nurse did come through.

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.770 align:middle line:84%
She said I had a high
fever through the night.

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea how
long I was there.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:58.040 align:middle line:90%
I think it was, like, overnight.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.310 align:middle line:90%
So I feel pretty good.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And I unwrapped my hand, I had
a little scratch on my hand.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just needed to
stand up and stretch.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So I took this
thing off my neck,

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and cut things off
holding me down.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And I got up, and I'm
stretching and popping my neck,

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:19.660 align:middle line:90%
and twisting.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:24.374 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor comes in and
just about has a heart attack.

00:46:24.374 --> 00:46:25.790 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
server your spine!

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:27.065 align:middle line:90%
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

00:46:27.065 --> 00:46:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, broken
this, fractured that.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.960 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't think so.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.325 align:middle line:90%
I feel pretty good.

00:46:33.325 --> 00:46:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Off to X-ray.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.400 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.990 align:middle line:90%
So I come back.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:42.140 align:middle line:84%
X-rays come back eventually--
you know how long that can be,

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.670 align:middle line:90%
it seems.

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:46.561 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't anything
broken, anything fractured.

00:46:46.561 --> 00:46:47.935 align:middle line:84%
The hole that was
through my hand

00:46:47.935 --> 00:46:49.930 align:middle line:90%
was now a scratch on my palm.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I don't
know how this can be.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.440 align:middle line:84%
No broken ribs, no broken
this, no broken that.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
how that's possible.

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to keep you
here for observation.

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, they'd cut my
clothes off of me,

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.660 align:middle line:84%
so I had a friend bring my
clothes and a pack of smokes.

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And I got dressed,
and I'm out of there.

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:16.865 align:middle line:84%
They gave me a whole
bag full of painkillers,

00:47:16.865 --> 00:47:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and I just tossed
them in the garbage.

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:21.215 align:middle line:90%
I heal fast.

00:47:21.215 --> 00:47:24.470 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:27.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that's
an understatement.

00:47:27.095 --> 00:47:29.728 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's not the first
time I've had to heal fast.

00:47:29.728 --> 00:47:31.061 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's funny.

00:47:31.061 --> 00:47:31.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But the
end result of that

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.230 align:middle line:84%
was that I suddenly
had an awakening

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:42.920 align:middle line:84%
moment when I was dead-- that
I'd been wasting my time.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.549 align:middle line:84%
And when they said
on the other side,

00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:45.840 align:middle line:90%
you're not supposed to be here.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.590 align:middle line:84%
You haven't even started
doing what you're

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be doing yet.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what that meant,
but I wanted to find out.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'd made a decision that
every moment was precious,

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and that an act of
kindness is never wasted.

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And it really reset
my inner compass

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:09.820 align:middle line:84%
so that I would start living
by a different dynamic.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Because up to that
point, from the time

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:16.580 align:middle line:84%
that I had my last contact with
ETs, and then all the things

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:17.235 align:middle line:90%
you experience.

00:48:17.235 --> 00:48:19.981 align:middle line:90%


00:48:19.981 --> 00:48:23.630 align:middle line:84%
For lack of a better word,
the crap that you go through,

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:26.270 align:middle line:84%
it can cause a person to
become jaded towards life.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:84%
It can give you a bad
opinion about a world.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or yourself.

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Or yourself.

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You lose so much when you don't
really see yourself clearly,

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.287 align:middle line:84%
and I think I had
to go through that.

00:48:37.287 --> 00:48:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
certainly helps you

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:42.352 align:middle line:84%
understand the plight of life
here, the experience of life.

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, it does.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh, definitely.

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:48.040 align:middle line:90%
So I became a new person.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And as a new person, I was
now set on a new course.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know exactly
what that meant.

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I was
28-years-old, roughly.

00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:04.680 align:middle line:90%


00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And then things were about
to change once again.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:14.465 align:middle line:84%
Now, where in this did you start
going to your "special cafe"?

00:49:14.465 --> 00:49:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, that
wasn't until years later.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happened, right after this,

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:19.313 align:middle line:84%
once you'd made your
mind up, that you

00:49:19.313 --> 00:49:21.680 align:middle line:84%
were going to, I suppose,
engage and be of service

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.680 align:middle line:90%
in the way you had planned on.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I didn't know how I
was going to be of service,

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.257 align:middle line:90%
I just knew I wanted to.

00:49:27.257 --> 00:49:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I knew that
I had these abilities.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I just neglected them,
because nobody really cared.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.050 align:middle line:90%


00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened
next was a whole series

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:42.050 align:middle line:84%
of events that had to do with
UFOs and extraterrestrials

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:43.720 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream, and a
very vivid one at that.

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And in this dream,
I was told that I

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:50.250 align:middle line:84%
was going to have to
go to this place middle

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:52.615 align:middle line:90%
the desert to receive a gift.

00:49:52.615 --> 00:49:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was going to be on a
certain phase of the moon.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:00.460 align:middle line:84%
There were all these
obscure little details,

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.051 align:middle line:84%
little data points
that-- I guess

00:50:03.051 --> 00:50:04.300 align:middle line:90%
at the time they were salient.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:84%
When I think back on it
now, it was a bit obscure.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, and lo and
behold, ended up

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:16.020 align:middle line:84%
going into a place in the middle
the desert, quite by accident,

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.270 align:middle line:90%
and receiving something.

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.420 align:middle line:84%
They showed up, and they
provided me with something

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.520 align:middle line:90%
from them.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And said, now, here's the
next thing for you to do.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
did they show you?

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: They gave me an object.

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:32.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a crystal ball.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And this object
was meant to help

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:40.070 align:middle line:84%
me to train my
mind-- to manifest,

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.159 align:middle line:84%
and to move energy, and so
forth, and also as an icon

00:50:43.159 --> 00:50:44.700 align:middle line:84%
that everything that
I'd gone through

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.960 align:middle line:84%
was a real thing
that had a purpose.

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So I used it and learned
how to get beyond the tool,

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:57.410 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately you
have to become the tool.

00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:58.930 align:middle line:90%
And so I mastered that.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.400 align:middle line:90%
It took a few years, but--

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what did
you gain from that?

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: That the energy
that you're going to move

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.580 align:middle line:90%
is not something you can push.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Energy, it isn't pushed.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how
hard you struggle,

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.550 align:middle line:84%
it's like trying to push water,
when you're standing in water,

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to make an opening so you can
get out-- it doesn't work.

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Energy allows you
to merge with it.

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
direction, then you

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:34.260 align:middle line:84%
allow it to do what it
does with your direction.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And that's
one of the things I

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.750 align:middle line:90%
learned with that crystal ball.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:38.291 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:38.291 --> 00:51:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So now, you know how to direct
and focus and become one

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.675 align:middle line:90%
with energy?

00:51:44.675 --> 00:51:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:45.841 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:45.841 --> 00:51:47.490 align:middle line:90%
So you've upped your skill set.

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the absolute
answers at that point.

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And the next few
things that happened

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.985 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
extraterrestrials more

00:51:56.985 --> 00:51:59.600 align:middle line:84%
than to do with healing
and the psychic phenomenon

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.070 align:middle line:90%
end of things.

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I started talking more
and more about myself,

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.210 align:middle line:90%
about my experiences.

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I heard people talking--
because I went to some UFO

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:13.840 align:middle line:84%
conferences-- and I heard folks
talking about things that, you

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.010 align:middle line:84%
know, who am I to
challenge anyone?

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
change anyone's mind.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But some of these
things they were saying

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.530 align:middle line:90%
were, like, out and out wrong.

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Just flat-- it's like, why would
someone even say such a thing?

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:30.424 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of goofy.

00:52:30.424 --> 00:52:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Like for example,
about the Grays.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they're our friends.

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.920 align:middle line:84%
They're here to make us do
this and do that for us.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:38.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:40.679 align:middle line:84%
I do know-- even then I
knew-- what was going on,

00:52:40.679 --> 00:52:41.470 align:middle line:90%
what the score was.

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:43.303 align:middle line:84%
And I already had some
encounters with them.

00:52:43.303 --> 00:52:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I had already been
warned about them.

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So I decided that maybe
I should say something.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.005 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
don't say something,

00:52:52.005 --> 00:52:53.860 align:middle line:84%
then you're in
agreement with them.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Same philosophy that
I mentioned earlier.

00:52:57.290 --> 00:52:59.660 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And, well, it went from
talking to small groups

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:07.090 align:middle line:84%
to larger groups, and
then to very large groups,

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and then going all
over the world talking.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now what
year was this?

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:11.120 align:middle line:90%
When did you start?

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.495 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: This
was-- I don't know,

00:53:12.495 --> 00:53:18.532 align:middle line:84%
it was probably
mid-80s until the '90s.

00:53:18.532 --> 00:53:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's when
you met our mutual contact--

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:22.236 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --was the mid-80s?

00:53:22.236 --> 00:53:23.164 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:23.164 --> 00:53:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
right, because that's

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.740 align:middle line:84%
when I remember first
hearing about you.

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:26.934 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:53:26.934 --> 00:53:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, then I had
created this thing

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.258 align:middle line:84%
called the guardian
crystal, because the people

00:53:30.258 --> 00:53:32.707 align:middle line:84%
on the other side had
shown me these things--

00:53:32.707 --> 00:53:34.290 align:middle line:84%
the other side, not
extraterrestrials,

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.920 align:middle line:90%
but in the spiritual realm.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.700 align:middle line:84%
This was like the
first incursion

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.407 align:middle line:90%
into the spiritual realm.

00:53:41.407 --> 00:53:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Someone mentioned
the Akashic records,

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and I'm kind of getting off
track talking about that right

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.890 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But I went around--
I'll get back to it

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:52.410 align:middle line:84%
in a moment-- I went
around and did this lecture

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:54.810 align:middle line:84%
thing all over the world,
all over the country.

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:59.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was a lot of fun.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:01.280 align:middle line:90%
I met a lot of neat folks.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And once in awhile it did steer
towards the healing aspect,

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was
fascinated with that.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So, end result being
that I stopped.

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
matter what story you're

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.790 align:middle line:84%
telling, whether
it's true or false,

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:27.030 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what
details you're providing,

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.390 align:middle line:90%
it's a circus.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And people are tuning into
you at these conferences

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.906 align:middle line:84%
because you're entertainment
and they need some.

00:54:35.906 --> 00:54:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like
being entertainment.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought they really
wanted to know answers.

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: So I stopped.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was about
that time that I

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.750 align:middle line:84%
decided I was going to
do something different,

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:55.170 align:middle line:84%
because being able to see
the other side-- seeing

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:57.500 align:middle line:84%
the other side
means more than just

00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:59.270 align:middle line:84%
looking inside of
a person's body

00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what's there
that might not be right.

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It means seeing
ghosts, the dead,

00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:10.080 align:middle line:84%
seeing the future, or
the past, psycomotry,

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.140 align:middle line:90%
prophecy, all these things.

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't any
one particular skill

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:18.380 align:middle line:90%
set that I was working without.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.695 align:middle line:90%
It was all there.

00:55:19.695 --> 00:55:23.000 align:middle line:90%
It was just normal for me.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So I decided that I needed to
develop that within myself.

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the time, I
was married to someone

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:32.810 align:middle line:84%
who wasn't very
supportive and thought

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:36.250 align:middle line:84%
it was all quite goofy,
a bit embarrassing.

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And that was always
the thing in my life,

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:42.790 align:middle line:84%
always-- I had to keep it
a little quiet, or else,

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:44.235 align:middle line:90%
chastised or made fun of.

00:55:44.235 --> 00:55:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't like being made fun
of just because they're blind

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.070 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not.

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:54.160 align:middle line:90%
So I kept it sort of quiet.

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:59.010 align:middle line:84%
But I had this-- and again
another experience-- where

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:03.020 align:middle line:90%
I was projecting out of body.

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I used to do it
quite frequently.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
time, there was

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:12.000 align:middle line:84%
someone on the other side
that was there when I died.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And his name, I
only knew him as M--

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.730 align:middle line:84%
like Mark, Matthew,
Michael, whatever.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And no, it wasn't the
Archangel Michael, or Metatron,

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:24.470 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, but it was M.

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And he says, it's time for
me to show you something.

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So he took me to this place,
which was like a library.

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And some people say, oh, he
went to the Akashic records.

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:36.927 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:56:36.927 --> 00:56:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But I want to this
place and was shown

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:40.990 align:middle line:84%
how to create
something that would

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:46.160 align:middle line:84%
have a very beneficial effect
upon the person using it.

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was made eons
ago, or the information

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.085 align:middle line:84%
was known-- I don't
know, it's all

00:56:53.085 --> 00:56:58.440 align:middle line:84%
so vague-- but by the
guardians of the universe.

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted me to
bring this into form.

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:07.210 align:middle line:90%
So I was shown how to do it.

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:11.566 align:middle line:84%
And I came back and told my wife
at the time, I had this dream,

00:57:11.566 --> 00:57:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and I have to make this
crystal, and it will light up.

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's really goofy.

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:19.580 align:middle line:90%
And why would it light up?

00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:21.080 align:middle line:84%
You gonna put a
light bulb in there?

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.038 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, no, there's
no light bulb in there.

00:57:23.038 --> 00:57:26.690 align:middle line:84%
It's going to light up
because of another crystal.

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:31.590 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever done this before,
and this is how you do it.

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:33.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, whatever you say.

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:36.120 align:middle line:90%
So I made it.

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I found out about
it-- from the other side,

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:45.950 align:middle line:84%
but then on this side-- is that
it had very similar properties

00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:49.610 align:middle line:84%
to what the extraterrestrials
used in their tools.

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:51.610 align:middle line:84%
They use light tools
as well, and they

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:55.620 align:middle line:84%
have quite a profound effect
upon human tissue-- living

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.050 align:middle line:90%
tissue, not human.

00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, this also had
the exemplary byproduct

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:06.660 align:middle line:84%
of causing the human aura
to become eliminated.

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And not just sort of like,
oh, I think I can see it,

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:12.370 align:middle line:84%
but it's like, by
god, there it is.

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.320 align:middle line:90%
It's clear and defined.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you brought
this into physical reality

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:18.547 align:middle line:90%
in this dimension?

00:58:18.547 --> 00:58:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:20.900 align:middle line:90%
And then I started selling them.

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.400 align:middle line:90%
People wanted to have one.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.600 align:middle line:10%
So, OK, I'll make one.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.259 align:middle line:10%
How much is it?

00:58:26.259 --> 00:58:26.800 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.500 align:middle line:10%
Figure out what it costs.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:31.740 align:middle line:10%
Before you know it, I had
orders for hundreds of them,

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:35.010 align:middle line:10%
and they went all
over the place.

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I stopped making
them after a while,

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:41.090 align:middle line:84%
because it was just
so hard to make.

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:43.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
them that were made.

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And those were my
little contributions

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:51.370 align:middle line:84%
to the people of this
world, is showing them

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:54.830 align:middle line:84%
how to see their aura
without being able to.

00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're out of time
already on this conversation,

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.060 align:middle line:90%
but we're going to pick it up.

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Because as you said, some
years later, after all of this,

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:07.230 align:middle line:84%
you started going out
to a place that you

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:10.200 align:middle line:84%
call The Cafe at the
Edge of the Universe--

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.312 align:middle line:90%
the End of the Universe.

00:59:11.312 --> 00:59:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Cafe at the
End of the Universe.

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And from there,
lots of knowledge was given.

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:19.692 align:middle line:84%
And in our second
conversation, that's

00:59:19.692 --> 00:59:20.900 align:middle line:90%
what we're going to focus on.

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sounds like fun.

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm having fun so far.

00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.340 align:middle line:10%
So in our next
conversation, Jerry's

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:27.820 align:middle line:10%
going to share
some of what he was

00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:30.060 align:middle line:10%
given by the "others,"
which is the basis

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.700 align:middle line:10%
for his ongoing classes.

00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a hands-on
approach to mastering

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:36.600 align:middle line:84%
your energy, your body,
your life, and your world.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.686 align:middle line:84%
