>>REGINA MEREDITH: Some of
the true beauty of these times

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.110 align:middle line:10%
is that we're being reintroduced
to the old, more connected ways

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.440 align:middle line:10%
of being with the elemental
kingdom, gods, and guides.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:10%
Most cultures around
the world have

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:10%
a tradition of interacting
with elementals amongst them.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.760 align:middle line:84%
But Christianity drove
this underground.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Kaedrich Olsen is
back with us today

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the Norse
pantheon of spirits

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.992 align:middle line:84%
that are here with us now in
these times and in the past.

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:40.325 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you again, Kaedrich.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:90%
KAEDRICH OLSEN: Hey, hey.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here again.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I would like
to start a little bit where

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.607 align:middle line:84%
we did before because you were
raised in a haunted house.

00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And you were raised
with a mother that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
encouraged you to go
into training, to develop

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
your skills in the world of
esotericism and paranormal

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.780 align:middle line:90%
goings-on around you.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little
bit about that

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and how that bridges over
to talking about Norse gods

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:90%
and guides and elementals.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, definitely born
into a haunted house.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.320 align:middle line:10%
I like to say I was literally
born into a paranormal life

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:10%
because my doc--
my mom's doctor,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:10%
when she was pregnant with
me, was Doctor Robert Bradley,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:10%
who invented the Bradley
method, who was the subject

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:10%
of the movie--

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:10%
part of the subject of the
movie, "The Changeling."

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So I literally
grew up with this.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I grew up going to a
spiritualist church.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I knew how to communicate
with spirits as a child.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a normal part
of life for me--

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:84%
watching TV channels
change while you're

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:84%
watching it, radios turn
on, hearing footsteps

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:90%
in the hallway.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.082 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it was a little
spooky because there

00:01:39.082 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:90%
were horror movies out there.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.457 align:middle line:90%
And I watched horror movies.

00:01:41.457 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:90%
I always loved horror movies.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:10%
But it was a little spooky.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.105 align:middle line:10%
However, my experiences
never matched

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:10%
what was going on in
the horror movies.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So it was confusing
a little bit.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.862 align:middle line:84%
But with all of that
aside, my mom still

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:90%
got me into psychic training.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
She took me to the
classes and the seances

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:90%
at the spiritualist church.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I got to see that
this paranormal side is not

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:90%
so unusual.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty normal.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I got to understand that the
supernatural is completely

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:90%
a natural part of our world.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So it was normal, natural for
me to be around this stuff.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a little odd to me
that the other kids in school

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.802 align:middle line:84%
and other parents were a
little freaked out by it

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and bothered by it because
it was so unusual to them

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
when I'm like,
don't you see it's

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:90%
a natural part of our world?

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And so I needed
to understand better what

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:90%
was going on all around me.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.575 align:middle line:84%
And my parents had a literal
library of books available.

00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lucky you.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.085 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm so envious
of your upbringing.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, it was great.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I read secret teachings of
all ages, at a young age.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were a kid.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.153 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It was beautiful.

00:02:39.153 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember reading about the
brotherhood of Odin in there.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.255 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I was
looking at tarot cards

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:90%
and different things.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.463 align:middle line:90%
And I got my first set of runes.

00:02:46.463 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what is this?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And I dove into the
runes and studied those.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, where
does this culture come from?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:90%
What is this all about?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.563 align:middle line:84%
And I started
reading the poetry.

00:02:55.563 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:90%
I started reading the sagas.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.397 align:middle line:84%
I read every book I
could get a hold of.

00:02:58.397 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, wow, this
is fascinating.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And what really struck
me over the years

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
of working with the Norse
and the Norse mysticism

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:84%
is that they, too,
shared the view

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:84%
that the supernatural,
the paranormal,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:90%
was a natural part of our world.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:84%
They lived alongside
land spirits.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:84%
They lived alongside
house spirits

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and other sorts of human spirits
and all sorts of entities.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was a natural,
normal part of their world.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't separate.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.893 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't individual.

00:03:26.893 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It was nothing that
they were afraid of.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, hey,
there's my neighbors here.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's share with them.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's invite them here.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Yule came around.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And they would open
their house to spirits

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:90%
of all kinds at Yule time.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.840 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just for friends
and family to come over.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.925 align:middle line:90%
It was for the spirits

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For all
the elementals,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
for the elves and dwarves
and whoever else was coming

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:90%
by for a little nip of grog.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And so that shaped my worldview
is, the Norse perspective of it

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.278 align:middle line:84%
and my own
perspective and seeing

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:90%
how they intermeshed real well.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.195 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, yeah, this
completely makes sense.

00:04:00.195 --> 00:04:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go
back a little bit.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.903 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about
when you were a little kid.

00:04:04.903 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:84%
You were watching these
supernatural films and horror

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:90%
films and so forth.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't matching
up with your reality.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So for people who
watch these things

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and are thinking, oh,
what wasn't lining up?

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
What was so off
for you in those?

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.557 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: When you
see a horror movie

00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:84%
or any supernatural
movie-- let's say,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.640 align:middle line:84%
it's not a horror
movie, it's just

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.062 align:middle line:90%
a benevolent supernatural movie.

00:04:24.062 --> 00:04:24.895 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not scary.

00:04:24.895 --> 00:04:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
You were expecting
thumping on the walls.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.415 align:middle line:84%
You're expecting a
voice saying, get out.

00:04:30.415 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:84%
You're expecting
something to fly

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:84%
across the room or something
very overt, very obvious.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.635 align:middle line:90%
That's not quite how it is.

00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Sure, there will
be some tapping.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Sure, there will
be some movement.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:84%
If you have house spirits, they
will hide little shiny things

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:90%
on you.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
You look for your
keys, where are they?

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.217 align:middle line:84%
It's the house spirits
messing with you.

00:04:47.217 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
But paranormal experiences
are very, very subtle.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
It's more like, you want
to connect with a guide.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:90%
You want to talk to a teacher.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people expect
it to be a great gestalt,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.538 align:middle line:84%
like us sitting here
talking back and forth.

00:05:00.538 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you reach out
to a guide, and say,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.747 align:middle line:84%
hey, can you give
me some clarity,

00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:84%
can you give me some
direction where I need to go,

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and you feel like you're
getting dead silence.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.115 align:middle line:84%
But yet, there's
this urge inside.

00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm curious, what
is this thing I was thinking

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:90%
about the other day?

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's go explore
numerology, for example.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Where?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Is this interest in numerology
And then you dig into it.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And you go, oh, that
was the answer I

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:90%
was looking for the other day.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:90%
So it's not overt and direct.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It might be giving
you a whisper towards something.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call my
guides the whisperers.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I do too.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:84%
They're always whispering,
inviting us forward.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's where you look
for the silence within.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:84%
You try to cultivate
that silence

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:84%
within because that's where
you hear that subtle whispers.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And fascinatingly
enough, in Norse lore,

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
there's a poem
called the "Hávamál,"

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:84%
the teachings of Odin, the
sayings of the High One.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.395 align:middle line:84%
And he says, literally in there,
I believe it stands at 80,

00:05:55.395 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:84%
that when you come to the
[NON-ENGLISH] and the high holy

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:84%
gods to ask of the runes,
the universal mysteries,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
it's best for one to be silent
because that's how you can hear

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:90%
the whispers of the runes.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very wise.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is,
this really feeds

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:90%
into the notion of desire.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:90%
We have a subtle desire body.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:84%
It's here to propel
us forward, to help

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
us engage in whatever it
is we need to engage in.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's all about,
is to help create a curiosity

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
or desire to move into something
we need to engage with.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can't discover that
voice if you're not silent.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.388 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can.

00:06:33.388 --> 00:06:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed a lot of people
that have been hit by a car,

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
struck by lightning, died
in all kinds of ways,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.803 align:middle line:84%
only to find on the
other side, yeah,

00:06:40.803 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
you need be quiet and
pay attention next time.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have
to do this to you.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So we can short circuit all that
by actually paying attention

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.730 align:middle line:90%
for that whisper.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, you
suddenly, hmm, numerology, I

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:90%
need to know more.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's how my guides
and my soul works with me.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:90%
I just get curious.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.025 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
pull that thread.

00:07:00.025 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:90%
It's like nudges.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:02.710 align:middle line:90%
It's urges.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
of inspiration.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
It's never like this
great overt answer.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just a subtle,
little touch.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that the beings

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
that I'm a soul group part of,
when they talk to other people,

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.887 align:middle line:84%
and people say, I don't know my
life's purpose and blah, blah,

00:07:19.887 --> 00:07:22.220 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah, blah, I just don't
know what I'm doing here,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.020 align:middle line:84%
what am I supposed
to be doing, which

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I find an interesting
question, anyway,

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:84%
they always say, what
would you like to do.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
They always ask, what
would you like to do.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And it puts it
back on the person.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's not long
before they start

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:84%
getting thumped with a message
about, hmm, I wonder about--

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:90%
I always wanted to be a DJ.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:90%
I did that in college.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.395 align:middle line:84%
And boom, they start a
new career or whatever.

00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: There's a Norse
concept called orlog.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Some people pronounce it orlog.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Orlog, it's basically
the primal law.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's the reason
why you're here.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:84%
It's your will with
a capital W. It's

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:90%
the purpose for being here.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And when people ask me what
that is, of course, I'm

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.548 align:middle line:84%
not going to give them an
answer because I tell them,

00:08:03.548 --> 00:08:05.730 align:middle line:84%
if I tell people, I give
you an answer, I'm wrong.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But if I give you the means
to ask better questions,

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:90%
that's the path to go.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So I tell them to
ask three questions.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.230 align:middle line:90%
What do you love doing?

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:84%
What can you do all
day long and just get

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:90%
super charged about it?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
What do you have a
natural talent for?

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Just like, what are you
skilled at naturally?

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.495 align:middle line:84%
And third, what
does the world need?

00:08:24.495 --> 00:08:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Because your view of what--

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those are the
three best questions.

00:08:27.495 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:90%
You are absolutely right on.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:84%
What makes time
stand still for you?

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And that's how
you discover your orlog.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What are you good at?

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:84%
What do you have
natural talent in?

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
What does the world
need right now?

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.672 align:middle line:84%
For everybody watching this,
I think we need to ask.

00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know the answer
to what you're here for,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.662 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself those
three questions.

00:08:46.662 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So meanwhile, we're going
to move on to a recent trip

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.670 align:middle line:84%
when you went to
Norway very recently.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:90%
And you had some experiences.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Here, I've written them down.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.587 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some
dwarves that you encountered.

00:08:56.587 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.587 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the white cave.

00:08:58.587 --> 00:08:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.070 align:middle line:84%
How I got to be there
was, I was invited

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to be a teacher, an
expert, as part of a group

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
called Awaken the Viking,
whereas about 20 people

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
gathered in Gudvangen,
Norway, where

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:90%
there is a Viking village.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:90%
There is the Fjord Hotel.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:90%
It's very rural.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:84%
It's situated between two
walls of mountains on a fjord.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:90%
It's very epic.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And as part of this group,
we went to the white caves.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's beautiful caves inside,
just white stone everywhere.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the name
of the stone, that is.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But we were invited to go
there and just meditate.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And we found a place to
sit down, to lay down.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
There was water
dripping everywhere.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's
completely silent.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Candlelight everywhere, so
it's just beautiful there.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:90%
And so I lay down.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to close my
eyes, but I couldn't.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
I tried to meditate,
and I couldn't.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what's
going on here?

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I close my eyes?

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I reached out to see if I
could feel energies or entities

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
because this place is full
of all sorts of beings.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And so I reached out.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, who's here?

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing?

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I'm
remembering another line out

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:84%
of the Hávamál, when
Odin discovers the runes.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And he gave some to the gods,
he gave some to the giants, some

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:84%
to the elves, some he
gave to the dwarves.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:10%
And I went, OK,
guys, if you're here,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:10%
and you're connecting
with me, give me

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:10%
your concept of what your
understanding of runes are,

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.420 align:middle line:10%
what are dwarf runes like.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they told me about rubble
piles or when stones move.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.995 align:middle line:90%
And one of the--

00:10:32.995 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean, as in like
tea leaves, how they land.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Like when stones move and
how they work with that.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And remember, runes are like
universal mysteries, not

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:90%
necessarily divination tools.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And so what I put my
hand on a little pebble,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, great, what is a
pebble to you in runic terms?

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:90%
And they said, that's old age.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what
do you mean old age?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.017 align:middle line:84%
And then they showed me when
it starts with a big boulder,

00:10:54.017 --> 00:10:55.832 align:middle line:84%
and then it wears down
over the centuries.

00:10:55.832 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes these
little tiny pebbles.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, I get it.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they were showing me
runes and universal concepts,

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:84%
universal mysteries, from the
point of view of centuries

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:84%
of stones lives, how stones
moves, how they connect,

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:84%
how they rub against each
other when air passes through

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and water passes through
and what that's all like.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm, like, how
very interesting.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.245 align:middle line:84%
So not the runes
we know that you

00:11:23.245 --> 00:11:25.620 align:middle line:84%
read, which are the ones that
have little symbols written

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.062 align:middle line:84%
And you put your hand in
a bag, and you draw one,

00:11:28.062 --> 00:11:29.220 align:middle line:90%
and it has its own meaning.

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the movement
and the placement

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.155 align:middle line:84%
and the size and interaction
of stone with its surrounding

00:11:35.155 --> 00:11:35.955 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:11:35.955 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And here's a
great opportunity for us

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
to explore a different
take on runes.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are used to
seeing runes exactly

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
as you say, a little
letter, a little character,

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.320 align:middle line:90%
on a piece of stone or wood.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:90%
That is a stave.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:90%
That's just a visual mnemonic.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:10%
The actual rune is the
universal form sources,

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:10%
the universal energies that
run through everything,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:10%
such as Fehu is about value,
Urus is about strength,

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:10%
Thurizas is about
aggression, Ansuz

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:10%
is about awareness and wisdom.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Those are universal forces
that you don't need the staves.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't need the
names or the words

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
that we can
understand as energies

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.780 align:middle line:90%
that run through everything.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:90%
They're involved everywhere.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Like the Urus of this
table, its ability

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to be stable and
strong, my Uru is

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
my strengths, both physical and
emotional, mental strengths.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:90%
That's Urus.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And so when the dwarves are
telling me about the runes,

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.600 align:middle line:84%
they were understanding
these little forces

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.695 align:middle line:90%
from their points of view.

00:12:27.695 --> 00:12:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.712 align:middle line:84%
But do you still do the
runes in terms of divination

00:12:31.712 --> 00:12:33.545 align:middle line:84%
when you're working
with clients and people?

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Sometimes, absolutely.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sometimes.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.535 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just to see what the force
is that wants to come through.

00:12:37.535 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it gives little
insights to what's going on.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Plus it taps into the
[NON-ENGLIS] the [NON-ENGLISH]

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:84%
or log on the [NON-ENGLISH] So
it helps me understand those

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:90%
causal forces.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Now we had two more experiences.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:90%
I love these.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.073 align:middle line:90%
These are all juicy.

00:12:52.073 --> 00:12:52.908 align:middle line:90%
I love paranormal.

00:12:52.908 --> 00:12:53.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not even paranormal.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I love normal, supernatural
that's natural.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So we have an instance
of a giant that

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:90%
was sleeping in the mountain.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many,
many tales, folklore,

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and in the "Eddas,"
that trolls and giants,

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.548 align:middle line:90%
they roam the night.

00:13:10.548 --> 00:13:11.590 align:middle line:90%
They're all out at night.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:90%
Or they're in the caves.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:90%
They're deep in the underground.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.452 align:middle line:84%
And if they're ever exposed to
sunlight, they turn to stone.

00:13:17.452 --> 00:13:18.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:13:18.535 --> 00:13:21.125 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And there
are standing stones,

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:84%
there are monuments all over
the place, where people say,

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:84%
yes, this is where the
giants turned into stone.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as
an American who

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:84%
had not been in Scandinavia at
all, I'm reading these stories.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you,
even though I grew up

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:84%
as a paranormal life, I grew up
surrounded by all this stuff,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.662 align:middle line:90%
I'm always a skeptic.

00:13:38.662 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Somebody tells me something's
in the house flickering

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
the lights, I say, OK, great,
let's go check the electrician.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.073 align:middle line:84%
They're hearing something in the
plumbing in the walls, great.

00:13:46.073 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's go check a plumber first.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Same way here.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK, these are great.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It's very analytical.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: These
are great stories.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.260 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to explain
their natural world.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to have
a good understanding

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:90%
of their natural world.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:84%
When I got to Norway,
and I saw these things,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:90%
these are very real.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
These are not
mythological metaphor.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:90%
These are very real things.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm at the hotel,
I'm looking across the fjord,

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.618 align:middle line:84%
and I see a giant's face on the
side of a mountain in stone,

00:14:14.618 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
looks like he's sleeping with
a happy look on his face.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, I get it.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:90%
These stories are real.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.215 align:middle line:90%
It's very real.

00:14:24.215 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was there a
lore that supported that?

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.325 align:middle line:84%
From what I understand,
that is a giant

00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
that is a protector
of that region

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and helps protect the people,
helps protect everything.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, these
are two giant walls

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.490 align:middle line:84%
of mountain with a fjord,
so there are rockslides

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:90%
constantly.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes So
they're warning.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like they
connect with another species

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:84%
that you encountered that
helped warn of a rockslide.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's right.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the nights, I was
going back to my room,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and I was really
tired because it's

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stuff we were
doing there as part

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:90%
of this event, a lot of stuff.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:90%
But I was tired.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.088 align:middle line:84%
And of course, rockslides are
happening all over the place.

00:15:00.088 --> 00:15:01.608 align:middle line:90%
But I'm seeing these two ravens.

00:15:01.608 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And two ravens are
going to stick out

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to me because Odin
has two ravens, Huginn

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and Muninn, thought and memory.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I see these
two ravens on a tree.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, wow,
that's really cool.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, they
start screaming, start yelling.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:84%
They get up, and
they start flying.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.457 align:middle line:84%
And they're yelling
and screaming.

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what are you all
about, only to suddenly see

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:90%
a rockslide coming down.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, you're
just giving the heads up.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like they knew beforehand
that the rockslide was

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:90%
going to happen.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were giving
us a warning, hey,

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
heads up, be aware,
rocks are coming down.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.040 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK, great.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Now I get it.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Also, the law is to
listen to the birds,

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.682 align:middle line:84%
listen to the chatter
and the speaking

00:15:38.682 --> 00:15:40.390 align:middle line:84%
of the language of
the birds because they

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:90%
will foretell events coming.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, see, this
stuff isn't just metaphor.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:84%
This is actual reality that
we like to just blow off

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:90%
as mysticism or mythology.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.085 align:middle line:90%
Mm-um.

00:15:51.085 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:90%
It's very rare.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.753 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is so cool.

00:15:52.753 --> 00:15:56.470 align:middle line:84%
You also were hearing
the local gods speaking.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, what's that all about?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
First of all, how
do they're gods?

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:90%
How did you hear them speak?

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:90%
What did they have to say?

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Were they talking to
you or to each other?

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Were you eavesdropping?

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That was one of
the most heart opening

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:90%
experiences I had there.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:84%
As part of the
Viking village, there

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:84%
is a sacred area where
they have god poles.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:84%
They have poles in the
ground with the faces

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.690 align:middle line:90%
of the gods on it.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:90%
There's an altar space there.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And we did do an old Norse
ritual called the Blot, where

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.500 align:middle line:84%
we raise a horn to
the gods, and we

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:90%
sprinkle meat on the god poles.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And we basically leave
an offering to the gods.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And that went as
normal as expected.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.730 align:middle line:84%
A little while later, when
everything quieted down,

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.210 align:middle line:84%
everything was quiet and calm,
I went back to the poles.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And I just had a
little connection.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.593 align:middle line:84%
I just reached out, just said,
hey, thank you, this is great.

00:16:43.593 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:90%
And then I heard them.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I heard them speaking.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And this time, it was a lot like
the gestalt like we look for.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
We're hoping the guides
to have that good language

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was actual talking.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was speaking
with Odin, at first, Odin.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Odin at first.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, wait a minute,
I can hear them talk.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing them speak.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're having this
conversation back and forth,

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.505 align:middle line:84%
where it felt like a lot of
gratitude for the teachings

00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing forward
about runes and the work

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing about continuing
bringing this message forward.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.625 align:middle line:90%
And other gods would speak up.

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I got a
different point of view of Loki

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
pole there for Loki.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Loki is often
thought of somewhat negatively.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about Loki for a moment

00:17:24.748 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:90%
and what you discovered there.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And Loki was there
talking a little bit too.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:90%
And of course, you're right.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Loki is depicted as the Norse
devil, which he's really not--

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:90%
he's the trickster spirit--

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:90%
really not.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But because everything that Loki
does in the lore, everything,

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
comes out beneficial for
everybody at the end.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm talking with
Odin, I'm talking with Loki.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
I realized Loki is the
lord of the shadows.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Loki is the shadow
worker of the gods.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.952 align:middle line:84%
Any of that crud and crap
that needs to be brought up

00:17:52.952 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:84%
to the surface, any
of that crud and crap

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be dealt with,
any of those old wounds that

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
are being projected
out with toxicity, Loki

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
is the one that brings
that to light, that

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:90%
brings that to the surface.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So of course, people
don't want to see that.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.858 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to see the
negatives about themselves

00:18:06.858 --> 00:18:08.280 align:middle line:90%
or the pain deep within.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
But Loki stirs that
up so you see it.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:90%
So you can heal it.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.115 align:middle line:90%
I went, thank you, Loki.

00:18:13.115 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:90%
I have a much deeper respect.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
makes total sense.

00:18:15.735 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Because first of all, we're not
going to walk into a dark room

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:90%
intentionally.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:90%
That's not what humans do.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking, when
they do that in the films,

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.263 align:middle line:90%
it's all right, I'm out of here.

00:18:25.263 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Who would create
a scene like that?

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
No one walks into a dark
room in a haunted house.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, we don't
voluntarily walk into challenge

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:90%
and darkness.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So wouldn't we need,
essentially, a trickster

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:90%
to somehow give us--

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
again, whether it's a
little desire a little nudge

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
or an overactive curiosity into
something so that it helps us,

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.140 align:middle line:84%
again, engage with the
things we must engage with

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:90%
but are trying to avoid.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So are you saying that's
essentially what Loki does?

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's
exactly what he does.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:90%
He provokes us.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.525 align:middle line:84%
And he pokes us and prods
us until we wake up.

00:19:00.525 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you could say
the devil, the whole concept

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.295 align:middle line:84%
of every entity that is
termed as Satan or the devil,

00:19:06.295 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:84%
is essentially doing
the same thing,

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:84%
tempting us, quote "come
hither" into exploring

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.050 align:middle line:84%
what we have refused
to explore perhaps,

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:84%
or what we need to explore
for our own expansion, growth,

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:90%
learning.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.992 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:19:20.992 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was from
this experience not

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.520 align:middle line:84%
only did I learn
Loki better, but I

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.140 align:middle line:84%
got to hear the
voices of the gods

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
again in a much stronger
and a much better way.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And I can proudly say that
even coming back to the States

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and still doing this work,
I can still hear them.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.100 align:middle line:90%
We still talk.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:90%
I've got images.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I've got statues of the
gods on my altar spaces.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And there are times where I just
close everything down, clear

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.497 align:middle line:90%
my mind, and they're there.

00:19:45.497 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And they're talking.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.667 align:middle line:84%
And when I sit with
clients, they're talking.

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is so neat.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
You had to go there, though, to
really bring in your connection

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:84%
with them, that it
had to be on that land

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen that so you
could bring it back with you

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of this life.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.735 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you must have thought,
I've done this before.

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:04.535 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:20:04.535 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You obviously have
been on that land from that--

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Kaedrich Olsen,
OK, from that land,

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and you were just reconnecting
with these beings.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Did you have any sense of why
it was now and not before?

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Was there something in
you that was just now

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:84%
ready to take on these
particular guides/gods?

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: There's
something I'm starting

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.230 align:middle line:10%
to understand from my
whispers that I'm calling,

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:10%
the starseed wound.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.150 align:middle line:10%
Higher level beings are
coming to this planet

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:10%
without a sense of linear time.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Linear time is a
construct of our brain.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Linear time doesn't exist.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:84%
But let's say,
there's sixth density,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:84%
seventh density, whatever
kind of density beings.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
They cannot resonate
with our third dimension,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.660 align:middle line:90%
third density existence here.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle line:84%
But right now in this
time point of humanity,

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
we are crossing that threshold,
where we're leaving war behind,

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
we're leaving this
destructive era behind.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:84%
We're evolving to a more of 5D
state of being out of this 3D.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we're seeing
starseeds awakening right now.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But in order to down-res from
their seventh density state,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
they had to come back in
past, humanity's past, where

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.093 align:middle line:90%
times were brutal.

00:21:10.093 --> 00:21:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people like to
say Vikings were awful,

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:90%
terrible people.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, sure.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
But so is everybody
else in the world.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hollywood makes
them look quite sexy, though.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: But everybody was too.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So the starseed wound is
the seventh-density beings

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:84%
come into a time that was
very brutal, very awful,

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
to be brutal and awful
to get that trauma

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
as their perpetuator
of some of this stuff

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:84%
or to have it happen to them
so that they can down-res

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
from seventh density
to third density,

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
so that here in
our time period, we

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.502 align:middle line:84%
learn how to heal that starseed
wound for all of humanity.

00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all part of
the collective unconscious,

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
so we learn how to heal those
wounds from the medieval period

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and through the
pre-medieval period,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:84%
so that today in the 3D,
when we're moving 3D to 5D,

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:84%
we can show humanity
how to do that,

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
how we do that healing
process because we're

00:21:58.620 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle line:90%
healing ourselves.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.080 align:middle line:90%
And we got great.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.497 align:middle line:84%
This is how you
move through that.

00:22:01.497 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let me ask
you another question here.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, not like I
wasn't going to,

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.000 align:middle line:84%
but something I'm
going tangential a bit.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Do these gods ever speak of
entities that have been here

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.410 align:middle line:84%
to mess with us, to
restrict us to an extent

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that most of this community
has heard about many times

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and other channeled beings are
now openly talking about them,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you've had
some restrictions.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's time for you to blast
your light through all of that.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said
recently that you

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:90%
are coming to the end of war.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:84%
However, those very
same forces that

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:84%
have kept people narcotized, and
even more so now through media

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and such, are seeing to it
that we're being blasted

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:90%
with every type of image.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Even the Vikings, I mean, it's
on what, Netflix or Prime Video

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:84%
or something, with
the bloody past,

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.880 align:middle line:84%
there's always a heroic
figure, but the brutality

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:84%
of being human, which
these other beings

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:90%
said isn't even our nature.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So do these beings
talk about other forces

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.245 align:middle line:84%
that they're working
with alongside us?

00:23:03.245 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:84%
They're a form of giant
called the Thursar.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Thurs is a singular.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Thursar is plural.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:84%
They have names like
Hati, which is the hater.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:90%
It's all about hatred.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.980 align:middle line:90%
It's all about destruction.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, these
are what the Gnostics

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:90%
would call archons.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.850 align:middle line:84%
They're the same
kind of entities.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
they work is, they

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.400 align:middle line:84%
get people to fight over really
silly, nonsensical things,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:90%
like words they call each other.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.843 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe, these
people are conflict.

00:23:32.843 --> 00:23:34.010 align:middle line:90%
They're fighting each other.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
They're warring
against each other.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll bring
in other people

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.480 align:middle line:84%
from other countries
as peacekeepers

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot to quell
that violence.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, that Thurs is going,
cool, let's bring more violence,

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:43.800 align:middle line:90%
let's feed me.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And so they're just creating
the cycle of violence

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:90%
over and over.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And here's an interesting
thing to note.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
These beings are called
Thurs, T-H-U-R-S.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And who is the main
combatant against the Thurs?

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Thor.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thor, yep.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They're the same words.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we go to runicly,
the TH is that aggressive,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:84%
that Thursar is an
aggressive character.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Raido is that manifestation,
that movement of it.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But Urus for Thurs is the "oo"
sound, making them primal,

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
making them very banal,
making them very destructive.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But Thor has os, which is a
rune of wisdom and knowledge

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So Thor is the homogeneous,
violent, aggressive energy

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.270 align:middle line:84%
but tempered with wisdom and
the higher state of being

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:90%
to destroy the Thursar.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
However, in the
Ragnarok, Ragnarok

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.200 align:middle line:84%
is basically telling
of the dark night

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.420 align:middle line:84%
of the soul of the
individual and the dark night

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
soul of humanity in general,
not the end of the world.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And in this tale, we find
the old gods, the old war

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:84%
gods, Odin, Thor, Tyr, all of
the old war gods are killed.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Their war--

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's over.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The chaotic forces
are destroyed at the same time.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.385 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is our future.

00:24:52.385 --> 00:24:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.572 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
humanity's future.

00:24:54.572 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And Balder, the
most beloved of all the gods,

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
was killed by Loki through the
work of Loki, kept in hell,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:84%
which the old Norse concept
of hell is not evil,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:90%
it's just a safe place to be.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And when Ragnarok is over,
Balder comes from hell

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.900 align:middle line:90%
and takes over.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And as the high
God, he's the most

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:84%
beloved, caring,
pacifistic kind of deity.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's showing that we're
moving from a warlike state,

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.340 align:middle line:84%
shifting to a higher
state of being,

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:84%
where we move beyond the
war, beyond the chaos,

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:90%
beyond the destruction.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:84%
It's even in Norse
lore that we move

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:90%
in that higher state of being.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.072 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk
about something else.

00:25:32.072 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Since we're talking
about beings,

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people watching
this think, yeah,

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.270 align:middle line:84%
but they've watched a
lot of shows on ufology.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, what about
the Nordic beings, the ones who

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
are the tall blondes
that are considered

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:84%
to have Nordic features, who
come to Earth, who are part

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:84%
of us, who perhaps, were part
of them, genetically engineered

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.840 align:middle line:84%
in certain parts of the world
to have those features as well?

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Do ETs, so to speak,
factor into this,

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.750 align:middle line:90%
to the lore and tradition?

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It's very likely.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.315 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know when we
look at Valiant Thor,

00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:84%
interesting that he
has that same name.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Valiant Thor.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: He comes to--

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The story of
"Stranger at the Pentagon."

00:26:10.685 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And we look at some
of the Pleiadians.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And even Swaruu says
one of the cultures,

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
one of the planets
in the Pleiades

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:90%
is the old Norse people.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.580 align:middle line:90%
So there's a big maybe there.

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
old Norse lore,

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
we find that the Aesir,
the high gods of the Norse,

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.710 align:middle line:84%
are the same as the Asuras
from the Hindu tradition,

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:34.650 align:middle line:84%
the gods that were kicked
out and travel the world.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And some of the stories of Odin
teaching all over the world

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.640 align:middle line:84%
match what some of
the Asuras taught.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very
interesting in that way.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And if we look deeper
into Norse folklore,

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.290 align:middle line:84%
we find multiple
tales of somebody

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
out at night finding what they
would call a fairy mound raised

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:90%
up on three pillars.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
the hill raised up.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But they're definitely
on three pillars.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.530 align:middle line:84%
There is a bright, glowing
light underneath there.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's some sort
of a party with elves

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:90%
or other otherworldly beings.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And when they go
into that mound, when

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:84%
they go into that
light, to them,

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.480 align:middle line:84%
they're only there
for the night.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.397 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:13.397 --> 00:27:15.613 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But when they
leave in the next morning,

00:27:15.613 --> 00:27:18.030 align:middle line:84%
they go back to their village,
and people are freaked out.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.890 align:middle line:84%
They're like, you've
been gone for 20 years.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:90%
You've been gone for 50 years.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.385 align:middle line:90%
So there's a time distortion.

00:27:23.385 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it sounds
like that does overlay

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:90%
with interaction with others.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.950 align:middle line:84%
So these may be
telling us that could

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
be some form of UFO landing
and otherworldly beings

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.060 align:middle line:90%
interacting with them.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about--
let's go to the household,

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, in the old ways, the
old Norse ways, and how

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.770 align:middle line:84%
the human being every
day was interacting

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.910 align:middle line:84%
with the different
elementals and such,

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.015 align:middle line:84%
and what the different
elementals were charged with.

00:27:51.015 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:55.090 align:middle line:84%
These beings were a normal
part of everyday life.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:59.140 align:middle line:84%
When you had a household, you
definitely kept a little altar

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.030 align:middle line:84%
with, maybe, some
milk or some honey

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:04.720 align:middle line:84%
or some sweets and shiny things
for the household spirits.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if you had
respect for them,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.082 align:middle line:84%
they shared that
respect back to you.

00:28:09.082 --> 00:28:10.623 align:middle line:84%
They would help you
do the housework.

00:28:10.623 --> 00:28:12.280 align:middle line:84%
They'd help keep
the places clean.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nice.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:13.985 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And they
would test you.

00:28:13.985 --> 00:28:16.435 align:middle line:84%
They'd put little debris on
your doorstep, little twigs

00:28:16.435 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:84%
or little things on the doorstep
to see if you cleaned it away.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Because they like a
nice, clean, tidy home.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.570 align:middle line:84%
They like you to be on
task with everything.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.132 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever fell off of
not keeping up that altar,

00:28:26.132 --> 00:28:27.340 align:middle line:90%
if you let things get dirty--

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They'd pile on more...

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --mess.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.380 align:middle line:90%
They would mess with it so bad.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.905 align:middle line:84%
And even if you did
something outside,

00:28:34.905 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:84%
maybe you had nature spirits
living around outside,

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.613 align:middle line:84%
there was a boulder in a place
that you didn't like a boulder,

00:28:39.613 --> 00:28:42.040 align:middle line:84%
so you got up and you moved
that boulder, now things

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:90%
are going haywire in the house.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So you got to do a
little mea culpa.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You got to put little
altar space outside.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
You got to find out what's going
on, consult with a local seer

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:84%
or say, hey, why are
they messing with me?

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.540 align:middle line:90%
What's happening here?

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you had that
experience when you were

00:28:54.748 --> 00:28:56.645 align:middle line:90%
there too at the stave church?

00:28:56.645 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:10%
The stave church
was very interesting

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.480 align:middle line:10%
because those were
land spirits there.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Now when we went up
to the stave church,

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
the stave churches are
all over Scandinavia.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.635 align:middle line:84%
And what they are, they're
churches built out of wood.

00:29:09.635 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:84%
From what I understand, there's
no metal in their construction.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:90%
It's just wood.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.240 align:middle line:90%
They're very elaborate.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:90%
They're very decorative.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:90%
They're neat to look at.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What era were these--
over what period of time

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:90%
were these?

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, I would say,
1000s, 1100s, 1300s definitely

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.580 align:middle line:84%
as Christianity
started coming in.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Because Iceland was the last
place to officially convert

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.190 align:middle line:90%
and that was in the year 1000.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:84%
There was old Uppsala in Sweden,
which tales were around 1300.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:90%
They finally switched over.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.320 align:middle line:90%
But Christianity kept coming in.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And what they would do is,
there would be a place where

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.760 align:middle line:90%
there was a pagan holy site.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And best we know, Indigenous
cultures all over the world

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:90%
know where ley lines are.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:84%
They know where sacred
energy sites are.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Old Norse were the same way.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They used their
own beans as the wise ones

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:90%
as a tuning fork.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.170 align:middle line:90%
So they built their temples.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:00.020 align:middle line:84%
There they put their
god poles there.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:84%
They put their statues, they
held their ceremonies there.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And as the way of every
culture on this planet when

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.860 align:middle line:84%
it's a new culture
coming in, they

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.710 align:middle line:84%
destroy the old culture, even
demonize the old culture.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:10.760 align:middle line:10%
And that's what happened.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:10%
These stave churches were
built on the locations

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:10%
of old pagan holy sites.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went to go
visit this stave church,

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling out the
land, just to be open.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I want to see what's going on.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was really,
really surprised

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.810 align:middle line:90%
to feel so much anger.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.880 align:middle line:84%
There was anger
all over the place,

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.382 align:middle line:84%
not in the churchyard, not
where the graveyard was.

00:30:31.382 --> 00:30:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Mind you, I did not
go inside the church.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I was a little too
freaked out by the energy.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:90%
But I stayed out there.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.475 align:middle line:84%
And when I went
outside the churchyard,

00:30:37.475 --> 00:30:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm picking up the anger
going, all right, who's angry,

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.720 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm feeling nature
spirits all over the place,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.070 align:middle line:84%
the huldufólk,
the hidden people.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK,
guys, what's going on?

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're showing
me clairvoyant images

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.330 align:middle line:84%
that this church is like a thorn
stuck in a channel of energy.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.790 align:middle line:84%
There's energy that needs
to be flowing through.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.800 align:middle line:10%
And this church
was like a thorn.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're almost
pleading me, begging me.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like, great, if you're
aware of this, can you

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.660 align:middle line:84%
pull it out, can you
get this out of there?

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, no,
I can't do that.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's just so much
anger that this is blocking,

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:90%
that energy blocking that flow.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, what
else is going on here?

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.950 align:middle line:90%
So I reached out even more.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And I felt the pull
over towards some trees,

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.170 align:middle line:84%
a little grove, off in the
distance away from the church.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:22.987 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what's
going on there?

00:31:22.987 --> 00:31:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I got as close as I could
because there's a fence,

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to cross
property lines of anybody's

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:90%
private property.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But I stopped at the
fence, and I reached out.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.847 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, there's
a bunch of stuff going on.

00:31:32.847 --> 00:31:33.930 align:middle line:90%
There's a bunch of energy.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, there they are.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.100 align:middle line:90%
And I reached out even more.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.672 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the anger,
there was deep sadness.

00:31:40.672 --> 00:31:42.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because their
land had been compromised.

00:31:42.755 --> 00:31:43.555 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:31:43.555 --> 00:31:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, where is
this sadness coming from?

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:46.960 align:middle line:90%
It was people.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:90%
It was people.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, why
are you people here?

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.130 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:51.390 align:middle line:90%
They're stuck.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:84%
These are what old
Norse would call

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.610 align:middle line:84%
the aptrgangr, the
after-walkers, the after-goers,

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:00.790 align:middle line:84%
what we would call lost souls or
people stuck in between worlds.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm communicating
with them as best as I can,

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:06.780 align:middle line:84%
they're conveying to me
images and feelings of horror,

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
of devastation, of trauma, of
killings and terror going on.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, holy crap.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, land
spirits, what's going on?

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, we're
protecting these people

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
know where to go.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.580 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what to do.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:84%
We're protecting,
we're helping them.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.345 align:middle line:84%
And can you get this
thing out of here?

00:32:21.345 --> 00:32:23.387 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are souls
that have been swept up

00:32:23.387 --> 00:32:24.870 align:middle line:90%
in the brutality of those ages.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:28.252 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a weird experience.

00:32:28.252 --> 00:32:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure what to
expect when I went there.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.950 align:middle line:90%
But it was certainly not that.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was eye-opening
and revelatory.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, there's
some weird history here

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:84%
that's embedded in
the energy of the land

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and in the memory of the spirits
and the land spirits there.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
takes us to another area.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
the old Norse also

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:50.640 align:middle line:84%
had a very sophisticated
understanding of the underworld

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.520 align:middle line:90%
after death, right?

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, is it like
the Egyptian "Book of the Dead"

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:90%
or something along that line?

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Kind of.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You see
Hel, her name, Hel,

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.730 align:middle line:90%
H-E-L is a daughter of Loki.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And the word "hel" in Old
Norse is not punishment.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not torment.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It is the root word for
health, wholeness, well-being.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So when you wish somebody
like, hel, Regina,

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.005 align:middle line:84%
I'm wishing you health,
holiness, and well-being.

00:33:22.005 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go to hell.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.995 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:33:24.995 --> 00:33:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And so the goddess
Hel and her realm Hel,

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:84%
some people say Helheim,
is that realm of healing,

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.870 align:middle line:84%
is the realm of
health and well-being.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the lore, it tells
us that Odin gave Hel

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.397 align:middle line:84%
charge of the nine
worlds of the afterlife,

00:33:39.397 --> 00:33:40.980 align:middle line:84%
not just the nine
worlds of existence,

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.280 align:middle line:90%
that's for other things.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But she has nine realms
of the other world.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.315 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
the lore, no matter

00:33:47.315 --> 00:33:49.440 align:middle line:84%
if you a warrior thinking
you're going to Valhalla,

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.310 align:middle line:84%
or if you are a beloved
people or thinking that

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:55.230 align:middle line:84%
you deserve an
afterlife of torment,

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.910 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
place for that too,

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.280 align:middle line:90%
that you cross through Helheim.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.400 align:middle line:84%
You go over the Gjallarbru,
the resounding bridge.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.580 align:middle line:84%
You judge yourself of what
you're going through there.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what these tales
are, if we really dig into it,

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.219 align:middle line:84%
and we put our
mystical mindset on,

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.739 align:middle line:84%
we realize that
hell is about losing

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.920 align:middle line:84%
who you thought you were,
sloughing off all of the crap

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.719 align:middle line:84%
that you think you
need to hold onto,

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.389 align:middle line:84%
your burdens of your daily
life, all of the trauma,

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:23.969 align:middle line:84%
all of the pain, all of the
expectations of yourself,

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:90%
the shadow work stuff.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.150 align:middle line:90%
You let that stuff all go.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you wake
up in the afterlife

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:90%
where you always were.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:84%
If you were that noble warrior,
you were always in Valhalla.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.250 align:middle line:84%
If you were a beloved family,
and you had a beloved family,

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:90%
you were in Fensalir.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.500 align:middle line:84%
If you are a common warrior,
a daily warrior thing,

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.610 align:middle line:90%
you're in Fólkvangr.

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.480 align:middle line:90%
You're there all the time.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.445 align:middle line:84%
It's just Hel is about clearing
away the thing that you're not.

00:34:49.445 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that makes sense.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And going back to the notion
of Loki, the trickster,

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.550 align:middle line:84%
to invite us in to
something we need to engage,

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:90%
but maybe, have been avoiding.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So then, it seems
to me that hell

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.570 align:middle line:84%
would be a version is, if
you refuse that journey

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and continue to stay stuck
and not advance and grow

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.050 align:middle line:84%
beyond what you're being and
what you're engaging with,

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.080 align:middle line:84%
what you're being invited
to do, that stuckness

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.890 align:middle line:90%
is a type of hell, so to speak.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But when you break
through, it leads

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.440 align:middle line:84%
to good health on all
levels, emotionally,

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.490 align:middle line:90%
mentally, physically,

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Which brings us
to an interesting notion

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.990 align:middle line:90%
that is in the lore.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:26.880 align:middle line:84%
There's something
called a straw death.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.250 align:middle line:84%
A person who lives to old
age, and they die of disease

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:90%
is called a straw death.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And they go to hell, whereas the
warriors go to Valhalla, right?

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.720 align:middle line:10%
Well, the big difference
is, is maybe somebody

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.670 align:middle line:10%
who died a straw death might
be clinging on to life.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.190 align:middle line:84%
They might be full of regrets,
going, I don't want to go,

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.245 align:middle line:84%
I'm not ready to
go, I can't be here.

00:35:44.245 --> 00:35:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to have
a harder time making

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.735 align:middle line:84%
that transition, which is
why I love death doulas

00:35:48.735 --> 00:35:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and psychopomps
because they help

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.490 align:middle line:90%
people make that transition.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.620 align:middle line:84%
But a warrior going
into battle has already

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.113 align:middle line:84%
made peace with themselves,
knowing this could be it,

00:35:56.113 --> 00:35:57.280 align:middle line:90%
this could be my final call.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:57.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to go.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fascinating
perspective on it.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So now are you working with
the layers of the beings?

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.720 align:middle line:90%
I have them written down here.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.070 align:middle line:90%
I can't pronounce their names.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:06.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But just quickly
going through them,

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.870 align:middle line:84%
are you working with
these, and as you said,

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.550 align:middle line:84%
the other gods that
you reconnected

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.700 align:middle line:84%
with when you're working
with your clients

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.107 align:middle line:90%
in terms of shadow work?

00:36:17.107 --> 00:36:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Are you working with them?

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.148 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes, somewhat.

00:36:19.148 --> 00:36:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about, here we have--

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.880 align:middle line:90%
how do you say it-- draugr.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Draugr.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.482 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Draugr, who is more
malevolent and destructive,

00:36:27.482 --> 00:36:28.690 align:middle line:90%
where is he coming into play?

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:29.380 align:middle line:90%
These are--

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I say, he, of course.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.925 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Actually,
in the stories

00:36:31.925 --> 00:36:34.000 align:middle line:90%
are all men, that's draugrs.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.700 align:middle line:84%
They are basically the restless
soul, the restless body.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:84%
You can think of them almost
like a lich or a zombie

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.910 align:middle line:84%
rising from the grave, causing
calamity, destroying things,

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:44.990 align:middle line:90%
killing people.

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's also like a
poltergeist, the noisy spirit

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that comes into your
house, throw things around,

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:52.310 align:middle line:84%
or the upset, angry
spirit that needs

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.730 align:middle line:90%
to be quelled and dealt with.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the lore is often
about the medieval remedies.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Chop off the head or you
bring peace to the body,

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.310 align:middle line:84%
so that it stops,
that kind of thing.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
tales about the draugr.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.900 align:middle line:84%
But what's similar but
different to the draugr,

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.880 align:middle line:90%
something called the haugbui.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And a haugbui is the
same kind of thing.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a reanimated spirit, but
they never leave the gravesite.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:84%
These are like kings or
nobles or very rich people,

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:24.170 align:middle line:84%
very well-respected people that
were buried in a mound, a haug.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And people will go
to their burial site.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And they'll see this
person in their mound,

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.430 align:middle line:84%
feasting and drinking
and having a good time.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Or they sleep on the mound.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And they have a conversation
with a person in the mound.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.000 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like a draugr, but
it never leaves the mound.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.220 align:middle line:84%
But you can go there
and consult with them.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:84%
You can talk with
them and say, hey,

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.070 align:middle line:90%
what's an answer to this one.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:46.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a very popular
story about a shepherd

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:47.880 align:middle line:90%
that wanted to be a poet.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And he slept on the
mound of a poet.

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And that poet taught him
some secrets overnight.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And he became a
world-famous poet.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Similar to these old
stories in Americana

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.690 align:middle line:84%
about going to the
crossroads, but there's

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
no repercussions, just a
good life of getting work.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So the next one is called, you
said, haug earlier, haugbui?

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Haugbui.

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Haugbui.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Haugbui.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:11.042 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us about--
these are more beneficial?

00:38:11.042 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:84%
These are beings
that you can now--

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.853 align:middle line:84%
do you work with them because
you can consult with them?

00:38:14.853 --> 00:38:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: We can today.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:19.110 align:middle line:84%
In America, especially, we
would have to go to a gravesite,

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.000 align:middle line:90%
to graveyard.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, there
are still spirits there.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.490 align:middle line:84%
They're sometimes
lingering there.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.650 align:middle line:90%
And so you could sit down.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And I will do this, sit
down with a picnic basket

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and just hang out and
let yourself tune in.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Put up your protections,
put up your barriers,

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:34.882 align:middle line:84%
and then just tune
in, and say, hey,

00:38:34.882 --> 00:38:36.590 align:middle line:84%
who has something that
has to talk about.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:37.802 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:38:37.802 --> 00:38:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you can have a
conversation with the spirits

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.820 align:middle line:90%
in the graveyard.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.647 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing about
talking with a haugbui.

00:38:43.647 --> 00:38:45.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, hey, what's
going on, what can we learn.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
have another one here.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.460 align:middle line:90%
It's called aptrgangr or so.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.520 align:middle line:84%
But this one is very-- sounds to
me very similar to the draugr.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Sort of, yeah.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:58.550 align:middle line:84%
An aptrgangr basically
means an after-walker, yeah,

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:02.500 align:middle line:84%
the same root, gangr, as when
we see doppelganger, same kind

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But these, we can
think of as lost souls.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.490 align:middle line:84%
These may be people who died
in a traumatic incident.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:09.290 align:middle line:90%
If you go to--

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like the ones
over at the stave church.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the land near it.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Those would be aptrgangr.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Or if we hear paranormal
tales, like maybe,

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.330 align:middle line:84%
there was a big shootout or a
big killing in a certain area.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 9/11?

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: 911.

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:27.622 align:middle line:84%
Or even here in Colorado, we
have the Big Thompson Flood.

00:39:27.622 --> 00:39:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you drive through that
highway going through the Big

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Thompson Canyon, there are lots
of aptrgangr there going, hey,

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.620 align:middle line:84%
what am I doing, what am I,
what's going on, why am I lost.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.002 align:middle line:90%
So they're not malevolent.

00:39:38.002 --> 00:39:38.960 align:middle line:90%
They're not benevolent.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just lost.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They're just lost
and maybe need some guidance.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:42.410 align:middle line:90%
That's an aptrgangr.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:43.805 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe need
a little recognition.

00:39:43.805 --> 00:39:44.605 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:39:44.605 --> 00:39:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then we have these
others, the [NON-ENGLISH]

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.593 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please, say it for me.

00:39:49.593 --> 00:39:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: [NON-ENGLISH]

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
was almost there.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And it literally means
those you wake up.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Up, like up,
[NON-ENGLISH] waking.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And these are the ones
that you call in a seance.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.290 align:middle line:84%
These are the ones that you
literally set the ritual.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:04.370 align:middle line:90%
You set the setting.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And you say, hey, ancestors,
hey, teachers, hey,

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.160 align:middle line:84%
my best friend, hey, mom
and dad, hey, grandma,

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.130 align:middle line:90%
come and hang out.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's have dinner.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch TV together.

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Those are the [NON-ENGLISH]
because you woke them up.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.440 align:middle line:90%
And called them in.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.240 align:middle line:90%
And the disir?

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Disir is the feminine, and
álfar are the masculine.

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And what we can
think of the disir

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:90%
as our ascended ancestors.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:35.130 align:middle line:84%
They are the matrilineal women,
the matriarchs of the family.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:35.930 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:84%
They're the matriarchs of
the family, the great aunts,

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.530 align:middle line:84%
the grandmas that not
only did they die,

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.270 align:middle line:84%
but when they went
to the other side,

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:44.083 align:middle line:84%
they were aware of
their crossing over.

00:40:44.083 --> 00:40:45.750 align:middle line:84%
They were aware of
their spiritual work.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:47.920 align:middle line:84%
They moved to an
ascended state of being.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And they hang out with a
family to give guidance,

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.460 align:middle line:84%
to give some direction,
give some clarity,

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.420 align:middle line:90%
give butt kickings.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not always
puppy dogs and rainbows.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:84%
They're like, what are
you doing, cut it out.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.140 align:middle line:90%
And so now here you are.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.430 align:middle line:90%
We have a few minutes left.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And the work you do is
a lot of shadow work.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that most
of it is with men.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, actually,
most of it's--

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.500 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, it's a
good mix of all of them.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is now.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.730 align:middle line:84%
It seems a few years
ago, you started out,

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.563 align:middle line:84%
you were working with
men's groups and such.

00:41:16.563 --> 00:41:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the shadow
work and the incorporation

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Norse pantheon of beings
that you're deeply connected

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.895 align:middle line:84%
with and how that feeds into
your work and helps others.

00:41:26.895 --> 00:41:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.550 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we're
doing shadow work

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.850 align:middle line:84%
is because we do live in a
paranormal supernatural world.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:33.900 align:middle line:90%
It is a part of that.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.960 align:middle line:84%
But most of the people
around here in our culture

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.640 align:middle line:84%
grew up going to
churches or seeing

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:84%
the TV shows and
the movies that give

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:45.700 align:middle line:84%
a scary, spooky, terrifying
example of the paranormal.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.378 align:middle line:84%
But they're getting
some connection.

00:41:47.378 --> 00:41:48.670 align:middle line:90%
They're getting this awareness.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.200 align:middle line:90%
They're getting whispers.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.940 align:middle line:84%
They're getting
clairvoyant images.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.760 align:middle line:84%
They're hearing things or keys
are getting lost in the house.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.840 align:middle line:90%
And now they're going--

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Earrings being stolen.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.152 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Earrings being stolen.

00:41:58.152 --> 00:42:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's a part of
them inside going, OK,

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.430 align:middle line:90%
this isn't something evil.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:04.240 align:middle line:90%
This isn't bad.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.560 align:middle line:90%
But yet, they're still scared.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.790 align:middle line:90%
They're still afraid of it.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.290 align:middle line:84%
They're still afraid
of reaching out

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:09.940 align:middle line:84%
because they're
hearing those stories

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.648 align:middle line:84%
that, no, it's not
grandma in your house.

00:42:11.648 --> 00:42:13.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a demon trying to
lure your soul into hell.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, it really is grandma.

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there are a lot
of negative stories out there

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that would propel
that kind of fear.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:19.750 align:middle line:90%
So you're basically there to--

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: To help set
the story straight,

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to say, yes, that
really is grandma.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Here's how you connect.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we do our shadow work
to go into those feelings,

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.080 align:middle line:84%
to go into those
beliefs, and let

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.060 align:middle line:84%
them have a say, to let
them know that there's

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.100 align:middle line:84%
a purpose that that
shadow really was there

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.170 align:middle line:84%
to protect them, really was
there to help them in some way.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we reintegrate the
lesson of that shadow.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the fear.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the negativity.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Reintegrate that energy.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So they can discover
their skills,

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.870 align:middle line:84%
their talents, their gifts
that they naturally had.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Like when they were a child, and
that wasn't an imaginary friend

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:49.870 align:middle line:90%
they were talking to.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It was one of their guides.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But mom and dad and
the church said, no,

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.400 align:middle line:90%
that's a demon tempting you.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But yet, that guide's
still saying, hey,

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.460 align:middle line:90%
I got something for you to do.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.543 align:middle line:90%
You're going to love this.

00:42:58.543 --> 00:43:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, but, but, but,
but but I was told that was--

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:03.190 align:middle line:84%
so we work through
that shadow of that.

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:06.378 align:middle line:84%
And then they go, oh,
that was my best friend.

00:43:06.378 --> 00:43:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, my best friend.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:08.567 align:middle line:90%
I freaked him out.

00:43:08.567 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I was afraid of him.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And they
reconnect and like, wow,

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:13.070 align:middle line:90%
life is so much better.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:13.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm connecting now.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:14.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:15.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.650 align:middle line:90%
And now my life has purpose.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:21.860 align:middle line:10%
And what's amazing is some of
these shadows hold people back.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:22.720 align:middle line:10%
They lock them in.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.670 align:middle line:10%
They have jobs or
relationships that

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:26.517 align:middle line:10%
are just toxic and destructive.

00:43:26.517 --> 00:43:27.850 align:middle line:10%
They work through these shadows.

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:29.183 align:middle line:10%
They work through these beliefs.

00:43:29.183 --> 00:43:30.773 align:middle line:10%
And then the job
opportunity comes in.

00:43:30.773 --> 00:43:31.690 align:middle line:10%
And they love the job.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:33.880 align:middle line:84%
KAEDRICH: That person that
was toxic in their life

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.020 align:middle line:84%
is like, OK, I've
had enough of you.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:35.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they're sad.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.060 align:middle line:90%
They're heartbroken.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.837 align:middle line:84%
But then I just met
this other person.

00:43:38.837 --> 00:43:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything, that's
the whole, one door closes,

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:41.755 align:middle line:90%
a window opens.

00:43:41.755 --> 00:43:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: .

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting
to be authentic.

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:45.292 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
live their orlog.

00:43:45.292 --> 00:43:47.275 align:middle line:84%
They came here to
live because they're

00:43:47.275 --> 00:43:48.400 align:middle line:90%
clearing those shadows out.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They're now able to
listen to guidance.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting the
teachers and the disir

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.832 align:middle line:90%
and the álfar in their life.

00:43:53.832 --> 00:43:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to
listen and hear them.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And they get the
guidance for themselves.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.793 align:middle line:84%
They're like, wow, I
can be a part of this?

00:43:58.793 --> 00:44:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Really, this stuff is
real, and I can do this?

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:01.520 align:middle line:90%
And it makes my life better.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so cool.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.055 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, it does.

00:44:03.055 --> 00:44:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you brought
up kids a little moment ago

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.260 align:middle line:90%
when you were a little kid.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
thing, to start

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.470 align:middle line:84%
seeing our children in
a little different way

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and giving them much more
latitude of exploration

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and when they tell us
these magical things,

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:19.850 align:middle line:84%
not to poo poo it, but to take
them seriously so that they can

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.980 align:middle line:90%
keep their own dreams alive.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.840 align:middle line:84%
We know what we love
when we're little kids.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.630 align:middle line:84%
We know what we love to do and
what makes time stand still.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:84%
But slowly but surely,
it's beaten out of us.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.410 align:middle line:90%
So we only have a minute.

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.670 align:middle line:90%
One quick thing.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.890 align:middle line:84%
What is the most
direct thing you

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:37.460 align:middle line:84%
would say a person can do to
open themselves out, quiet

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:41.570 align:middle line:84%
themselves, and open
themselves to hear the whisper?

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.452 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: To be aware
of your thoughts,

00:44:43.452 --> 00:44:44.910 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of your
feelings, to be

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:47.790 align:middle line:84%
aware of how your body feels,
just to be aware of it,

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.740 align:middle line:84%
just have that awareness
of your thoughts.

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And the more thoughts you
have racing, the better.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you move to
this neutral space,

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.200 align:middle line:84%
where you're aware
of your thoughts,

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.060 align:middle line:84%
you're aware of your feelings,
you're aware of your emotions,

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.810 align:middle line:90%
but you're not a part of them.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:01.980 align:middle line:84%
You're in this silent space,
separate from all those things,

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.940 align:middle line:90%
but you're aware.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you suddenly
pick up other little things

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:05.670 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, oh,
that's not coming from me.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:10.503 align:middle line:84%
That's not part of the din of
my thoughts or my emotions.

00:45:10.503 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:90%
This is something different.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.878 align:middle line:84%
And the more you pay attention
to those little subtle

00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:16.380 align:middle line:84%
whispers, those little subtle
nudges, the clearer they get.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say louder,
but the clearer they get,

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and the easier it is
to tune in to them

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:23.490 align:middle line:84%
