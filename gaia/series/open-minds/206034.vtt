>>GREGG BRADEN: There is
a battle for our thoughts.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.440 align:middle line:90%
A battle for our beliefs.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But the fundamental
battle, the hidden battle,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:84%
the silent battle, it's a
battle for our very humanness.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:84%
In one generation
we will decide,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:84%
do we give our humanness away
to machines, to technology?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Or do we allow that
technology to serve us?

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.058 align:middle line:90%
We are over-endowed.

00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: People love
it when I say that.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:90%
We're an over-endowed species.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Because we emerged 200,000
years ago with capabilities

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:84%
light years beyond
what would ever

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
have been needed
for daily survival.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
There are scientists
who, in their arrogance,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
believe that they understand
consciousness and life to such

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
a degree that it can be
reduced to ones and zeros.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Just because we can--

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't
mean we should.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.183 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Doesn't
mean that we should.

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.225 align:middle line:84%
The technology has advanced
faster than our value.

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: But I'm an optimist.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm also a realist.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's something
good coming from this.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.607 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I see happening.

00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:12.615 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have a very
special guest with us today,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Gregg Braden.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be looking at
the latest discoveries pointing

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:84%
to how truly magnificent
the human species is.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:10%
However, we're going to
be talking about some

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:10%
of the stuff that's
preventing it at this time.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Gregg, I am so happy
you're back here with me.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Because both of us have
this intense feeling

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:84%
that there are things that
must be addressed now.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:84%
That we're in a unique
position to address.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And you are taking
this on in a big way,

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.345 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of the work
you're doing already.

00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And so, I'm just
thrilled to have

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.900 align:middle line:90%
this conversation with you.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.317 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying
to figure it out.

00:01:45.317 --> 00:01:46.830 align:middle line:84%
How long since we
saw each other?

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's been
way too long, Regina.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I though
maybe two or three years.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.227 align:middle line:90%
You said more like five.

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: It's been longer
than two years, I know.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:10%
And I'm really excited
to be with you,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:10%
to be with your community,
with our community today.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:10%
Because this is just
such a precious time

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:10%
in the history of our world.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Precious.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: And it's a tough time.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
very tough time.

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, we want to
avoid it and kind of put salve

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:90%
over the wounds and pain.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that anymore.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And you have actually said,
we're in a silent battle.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yes.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of epic proportions.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think as people hear
those words, they can feel it.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
But why don't you just
launch in and start

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.650 align:middle line:90%
talking about it in your terms.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We are experiencing
battles within battles.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are more
obvious than others.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all know there's
a battle for our thoughts.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.130 align:middle line:84%
It's playing out through
mainstream media.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
We're being conditioned
to think about ourselves

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship to the
world in very certain ways.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:90%
It's all about our story.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk about the
human story, a lot of people

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:84%
feel like maybe it's, kind
of, an academic conversation

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.277 align:middle line:90%
or philosophical conversation.

00:02:51.277 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But when you really
begin to think about it,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
we live our lives, Regina, based
upon the way we've been taught

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:90%
to think about ourselves.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.560 align:middle line:84%
We solve our everyday problems,
we choose our relationships,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
we heal our bodies, we
choose our politics,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
we build our society based
upon the way we've been taught

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:90%
to think about ourselves.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:90%
That's our story.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a new human story
that's emerging that changes

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the story that is
the subject of the battle.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
There is a battle
for our thoughts.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
About the way we think of our
relationship to the world.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
But there's a battle
for our beliefs.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
It's playing out in
academia about who we are.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:90%
What our origins are.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain this.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Because you--

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.795 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:33.253 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You intersect heavily
with the world of academia,

00:03:33.253 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:90%
in your work.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And we've looked at it in media.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:90%
We've looked at it in politics.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:90%
These are apparent.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about how
it's playing out in academia.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Because, in my opinion,
the entire system

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:84%
needs to be scratched and
built from the ground up.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, the problem is
that the story that academia

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:84%
is conditioned to teach
through public education--

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:84%
through mainstream
public education

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:84%
is no longer
supported by the data.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: New science,
new discoveries

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
have overturned the
existing theories.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line is that
rather than us emerging from

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.725 align:middle line:84%
a universe-- a dead universe
that is inert in its nature--

00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
the new discoveries are telling
us the universe is alive.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:90%
It is conscious.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:90%
It is intelligent.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
us, rather than us

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
being the product, Regina,
of random mutations

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
or what's called lucky
biology, the new DNA studies

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
that were science fiction
only a few years ago, we now

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to extract the
DNA from the fossilized remains

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
of ancient forms of life
that we used to believe

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:90%
were our ancestors.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Once we have that DNA, we can
compare that genome to us.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And what has been revealed
is that we did not

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.099 align:middle line:84%
descend from these ancient
primitive forms of life,

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.307 align:middle line:90%
as we've been led to believe.

00:04:51.307 --> 00:04:51.374 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:90%
We didn't.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.407 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Here's the kicker.

00:04:53.407 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And scientists agree on the
date that, what are called,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.650 align:middle line:90%
anatomically modern humans.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:84%
We are anatomically
modern humans.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.030 align:middle line:84%
We emerged about
200,000 years ago.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Scientists agree on that.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
The controversy is,
where did we come from?

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Because what the DNA is
showing us is that through very

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
specific mutations that
cannot happen through nature,

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
we emerged with the bodies,
with the brain capacity,

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
with the neural networks
that we have now.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Fully intact.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Fully enabled.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.900 align:middle line:84%
They did not develop
slowly, gradually

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.985 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:05:29.985 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:84%
We have not changed in
those 200,000 years.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Now this very
principle violates one

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
of the fundamental principles
of Darwin's theory.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Alfred E. Wallace contributed
to the theory of evolution.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom
line, his statement

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
was that nature
never over-endows.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
that nature will only

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:84%
give a life form what it
needs to survive in the moment

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:90%
that it needs it.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: We are over-endowed.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:84%
We are an over-endowed--
people love it when I say that.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:84%
We're an over-endowed
species because we arrived

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
we emerge 200,000 years
ago with capabilities

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
light years beyond
what would ever

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:84%
have been needed for daily
survival 200,000 years ago.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're only beginning to
understand what those are.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.932 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to the battles
that we're talking about.

00:06:19.932 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
There is a battle
for our thoughts.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.787 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle
for our beliefs.

00:06:22.787 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:90%
What we believe about ourselves.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But here's the fundamental
battle, the hidden battle,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:90%
the silent battle.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a battle for
our very humanness.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Our very humanness
is on the line

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:84%
because technology is now moving
to replace our natural biology.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And I want to be really clear.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scientist.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I come from a
world of high tech.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm not against high tech.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to compromise
and give away our humanness

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:84%
to computer chips and wires
and chemicals in our body,

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.120 align:middle line:84%
our natural abilities
begin to atrophy.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And it happens in
one generation.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
The next generation,
those abilities disappear.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Neural connections
begin to disappear.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And functions in the human
body begin to disappear.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how
much of ourselves

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:84%
are we willing to give
away to the technology?

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is we cannot
answer that until we know who

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:84%
we are and the full potential
of what it means to be human.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the battle.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The battle
is for our humanness.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And certain aspects
and even, kind of, abilities

00:07:32.763 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:84%
that we take for granted are
already beginning to atrophy.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of our
overdependence on technology.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is a collapsing
field, but an expanding one.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go a little
further into that subject.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:90%
I share your same concern.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And I also laugh
at the arrogance

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.360 align:middle line:90%
of the scientific community.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like we've
seen the films, right?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920 align:middle line:90%
There are a lot of them.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:90%
One of the best was "Get Out."

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.298 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't
you love that one?

00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] "Get Out."

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh my
god, it's so arrogant

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.805 align:middle line:84%
to think that you
can just choose.

00:08:07.805 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about the players involved.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:10.888 align:middle line:90%
I think it's important.

00:08:10.888 --> 00:08:12.360 align:middle line:90%
And you know a lot about this.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.420 align:middle line:84%
The players that are
behind transhumanism.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I was looking into this
about a decade ago.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
at a site and it

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:90%
was called Intelligence.org.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:90%
That site is gone.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the players
involved, how many of them

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:90%
were from MIT.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.780 align:middle line:84%
A huge percentage were
from MIT at that time.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Atheistic in nature
across the board.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, this to me is where
the arrogance and the fear

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:90%
comes in side by side.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:90%
If you actually think--

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --there's nothing
more to you and it's truly dust

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
to dust, that you're--
that's an annihilation of you

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:90%
as an entity.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And you have the capacity
to develop technology that

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:90%
could somehow supplant that.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Who wouldn't be tempted?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
this is the thing.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're covering
a lot of ground.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:90%
Let me-- let me--

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, go for it.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Let me
give a quick example

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
for people that may not
be familiar with exactly

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
what we're talking
about and then

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.315 align:middle line:84%
how that leads into the
transhuman movement.

00:09:06.315 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Do, please.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.997 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So when we talk about
atrophy in the technology,

00:09:09.997 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:90%
a perfect example--

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk has
created the company--

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.340 align:middle line:84%
he has a company now
called Neuralink.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And it is the first chip that is
designed to actually interface

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
in the human brain where
neurons are actually interfacing

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
with the chip to connect
the human brain to the heart

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:84%
drive of a computer with
no physical connection,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:90%
with no wires.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like a Bluetooth.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Now--

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your thoughts
become manifest and operate.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Now, to
a young person--

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cool.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --who has not been
taught about their bodies,

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:84%
their relationship
to their bodies,

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.828 align:middle line:84%
and how rare the human
potential really is, when

00:09:48.828 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:90%
they hear that, they say sweet.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Who wouldn't want to game
without touching the keyboard?

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:84%
But Elon Musk himself in
an interview recently--

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:90%
this is fascinating.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, as a
businessman, I have

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to push the edge
of this technology

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:84%
so that we can stay
ahead of our competition.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, but we need-- not me,
specifically-- our industry

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:90%
needs to be regulated.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'm afraid.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's been
saying this for years.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --of
where this is going.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So all of
this is leading to--

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's a term you
just mentioned-- what is

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:90%
called the transhuman movement.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.280 align:middle line:90%
And this is a new term.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
It means different things
to different people.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Technically, there are three
levels of transhumanism.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Transhumanism is
to varying degrees

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
replacing our natural
biology with technology.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And we already do that to
some degree-- contact lenses,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:90%
and prosthetics--

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --artificial titanium
hips and things like that.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:84%
That is in the first
level of transhumanism.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.152 align:middle line:90%
And we do that.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
there's anything

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:90%
wrong with any of these.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:84%
But the second level
takes a little bit deeper.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The second level is where the
belief is that the human body,

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:90%
carbon-based life is flawed.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:84%
This is underlying the
thinking of transhumanism.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And that through technology,
we can transcend those flaws.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So the second level
of transhumanism

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:84%
is replacing the physical
body with gadgets,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:84%
with machines, with
chips, with wires,

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:90%
but keeping the human brain.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The third level-- and this is
what you were just referring

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
there are scientists
who, in their arrogance,

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:84%
believe that they understand
consciousness and life to such

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
a degree that it can be
reduced to ones and zeros--

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:90%
It's laughable.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --and
electrical impulses

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:90%
stored on a computer chip.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So the third level, in an
attempt to gain immortality,

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:84%
is to store human consciousness
on a chip when the body passes.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.020 align:middle line:84%
That information then
is downloaded either

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
into an artificial body
or another physical body.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't worked yet.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
the way that science

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
will be led to understand
that there's more to us

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:90%
than ones and zeros.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.475 align:middle line:84%
We are not simply
electrical impulses.

00:12:10.475 --> 00:12:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That it'll happen
through their failures.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Just like cloning.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, when they
started cloning

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and they successfully
cloned Dolly,

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
the famous-- the
famous sheep-- well,

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:90%
they definitely cloned her.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:84%
She began to deteriorate
and died prematurely.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And they still don't
understand why.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:84%
They said physically
all the stuff is there.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:90%
The genes are there.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.232 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:12:32.232 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And what they
haven't accounted for

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:84%
is the non-physical
essence of our being.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.090 align:middle line:84%
But this is where
we are right now.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So my position-- I feel
very-- because it's going

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:90%
to happen in one generation.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
In one generation, we're
going to have the opportunity

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:84%
to replace so much
of our humanness

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
through technology,
recreationally, we think.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
But when we stop using
the neurons, for example,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:84%
in the case of the
computer chips,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.680 align:middle line:84%
those neural connections
begin to degrade.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon-- we've all
heard use it or lose it.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon the
biology says, I don't--

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm not needed any longer.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:84%
The next generation, we
lose those functionalities

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.320 align:middle line:84%
of mirror neurons,
for example, that

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:84%
were only discovered in 2004
in the human brain that mimic.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.227 align:middle line:84%
When a mirror neuron
witnesses something happening

00:13:23.227 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
in the world, it doesn't
know the difference

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
between having the
experience and watching it.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So when we witness
a healing of another human,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.020 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in the world
around us or in our imagination,

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
the mirror neurons begin to
tell our body, better get in--

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:84%
get with the program to create
the chemistry to reflect

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:90%
what it is that we're seeing.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
We stand to lose
potentials like that.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give you
an actual example of what's

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:90%
happening right now.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Some societies are adapting
the technology much faster

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:90%
It's just their culture.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
In Japan, for example,
what is happening

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
is that the digital
relationships are replacing

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.980 align:middle line:90%
human intimate relationships.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.988 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And I've talked
to people in this movement.

00:14:09.988 --> 00:14:11.128 align:middle line:90%
They say, it's less messy.

00:14:11.128 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:90%
You don't have arguments.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.087 align:middle line:90%
You don't have fights.

00:14:13.087 --> 00:14:14.087 align:middle line:90%
You don't have emotions.

00:14:14.087 --> 00:14:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also having
high levels of suicide.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
it's not fulfilling.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But here's what's happening
now, the infertility

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
rates-- the women
are becoming sterile.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Men-- the sperm
count is dropping.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not 100% attributed
to this technology,

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:84%
but this technology
is a big part of it.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.968 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And what
has now happened

00:14:34.968 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
is the birth rate now has
dropped below the mortality

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.260 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:84%
More of their society are
dying than are being born.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And technology is
contributing to that.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's a perfect example.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is
if left unchecked

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:84%
to an actual
extinction event that's

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.637 align:middle line:90%
self-created through technology.

00:14:53.637 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Precisely.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So here's-- this is where
the science comes in.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scientist.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And you nailed it when you
talk about the arrogance.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been in scientific
conversations

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:90%
all of my adult life.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And there are two schools
of thought, Regina,

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.140 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to technology.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:84%
There are some
scientists who say,

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
if we were never meant
to do these things,

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:84%
we would never figure
out how to do them.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So learning and discovering
is the license to implement.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:84%
There's another school that
says, well, not so fast.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Just because we can--

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't
mean we should.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.757 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --doesn't
mean that we should.

00:15:26.757 --> 00:15:30.095 align:middle line:84%
The technology has advanced
faster than our values.

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We must determine what
we cherish as a human species

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and bring those values
front and center

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and make them the
foundation of our policies

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.047 align:middle line:84%
that are governing how this
technology is coming into play.

00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I totally agree.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it advancing
faster than essentially

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:84%
our ability to deal with it on
an ethical level and so forth,

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.640 align:middle line:84%
but we don't even have
the innate understanding

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:90%
of what the mind is.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have the
innate understanding

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
of the interconnectedness
between mind and all.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know what
that means to a soul

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and what part of
the soul is caring.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Exactly.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do they
think they're going to have

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
an artificial body and
brain-- digital brain--

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.710 align:middle line:90%
imbued with a soul?

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, this is where--

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.277 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
what I find interesting.

00:16:21.277 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, this is my
message right now is-- again,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.942 align:middle line:84%
I'm not opposed
to the technology.

00:16:25.942 --> 00:16:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not right,
wrong, good or bad.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:90%
We have it.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:90%
It's never going to go away.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:84%
It's how we apply
it in our lives.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:84%
How much of ourselves do we
give away to the technology?

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.055 align:middle line:84%
We can't answer that
until we know who we are.

00:16:38.055 --> 00:16:38.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:38.855 --> 00:16:40.278 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And we're
only beginning

00:16:40.278 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:90%
to understand who we are.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Now, here's
where the science--

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.880 align:middle line:90%
hard core science comes in.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
All of the technology
that is now

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:84%
being developed in
the world around us--

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I worked in the Cold War
years, in the defense industry,

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
space-based lasers, Star
Wars Defense Initiative.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.335 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I worked on that.

00:17:00.335 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:90%
So I've seen high-tech.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And I have yet to
this moment, Regina,

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
seen any tech in
the world around us

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that does not mimic what
we already do in our cells,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:90%
except our cells do it better.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.982 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So every
cell in our body--

00:17:13.982 --> 00:17:16.640 align:middle line:84%
the average human, for example,
is about 50 trillion cells.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:84%
You and I may have a
few more, a few less.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But each of those cells
is about 0.07 volts

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.810 align:middle line:90%
of electrical potential.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.310 align:middle line:84%
You say, well,
that's not very much.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:90%
But 50 trillion--

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --times 0.07.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.297 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about 3.5 trillion
volts of electrical potential.

00:17:32.297 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't stop there.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Every cell is a transistor.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:36.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a resistor.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a capacitor.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:84%
We store information just
like a computer chip.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:90%
We retrieve it.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.310 align:middle line:90%
We are photon generators.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:90%
We are photon receivers.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle line:90%
We do all these things.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And here's the beauty--
we self-regulate.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:84%
We are the only form of life
that we know of right now--

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure there are others--

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:84%
but the only form of life on
Earth that can consciously

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:84%
sit down in a moment and
time and say, in this moment,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.685 align:middle line:84%
I choose to strengthen
my immune system.

00:18:01.685 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:90%
And who doesn't want that--

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --in the
world of COVID?

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.735 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We can
sit down and say

00:18:06.735 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I choose to awaken
the longevity enzymes.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Transhumanism is
about immortality.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability endlessly
to create, and regenerate,

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and rejuvenate
life in our bodies

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.665 align:middle line:84%
without the
technology around us.

00:18:25.665 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here, here.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
hypocritical about this is

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.890 align:middle line:90%
here this is the Holy Grail--

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to offer this Holy Grail, this
extremely elongated lifespan,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the promise of
transhumanism, right?

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:84%
To be able to become,
in fact, even immortal.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Which we already are immortal.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:84%
We just change vehicles
from time to time, right?

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But the whole notion
that they're ready--

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:54.850 align:middle line:84%
the world of one body of science
is ready to go down that path

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and take people with
it, and at the same time

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
constantly try to invalidate
processes such as something

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:90%
as simple as remote viewing.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:84%
How can you not even acknowledge
what the mind and the being

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:84%
as capable of and then try
to literally push humanity

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:90%
down this--

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: And the heart.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --other path?

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The mind
and the heart.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the heart.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Because only in 1991,
the existence of neurons--

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.360 align:middle line:84%
brain-like neurons were
discovered in the human heart

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:90%
that think, feel--

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --emote, learn,
and remember independently

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:90%
of the cranial brain.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And all of this what I
call the soft technology

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:90%
that we self-regulate.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Now, where this gets--

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're already
capable of all of these things.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: We are.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where's
the enhancement

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:90%
they're offering us?

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you really want to be in
the same body for 400, 500,

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.470 align:middle line:84%
600 years or would you
like to change it up a bit?

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.228 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I would like
to change it up a bit,

00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:55.510 align:middle line:90%
bring my consciousness along.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Think how
much work you could get

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:90%
done in 400, 500, 600 years.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It could, but--

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.187 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Think about this--

00:20:00.187 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:84%
what if you were in a
relationship and you said,

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:84%
sweetie, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.355 align:middle line:90%
and you're looking at 500 years.

00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So what
does that mean?

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
are implications.

00:20:08.555 --> 00:20:09.355 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:09.355 --> 00:20:11.355 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That's a whole
different conversation.

00:20:11.355 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:90%
But you see what I'm saying.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is why are we so
attached to the physical

00:20:15.785 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
when we're so much more than
the physical that we would even

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
have to put so much
energy, so many resources,

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and so much mental
manipulation into this agenda?

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I think the answer--

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:90%
it's a good question.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And there are
probably many answers.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the
primary answers is fear,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --because if
we don't know who we are,

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
then we are looking
to technology

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:84%
to protect us from
death, from disease.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:middle line:84%
This is up for
everyone right now

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:52.542 align:middle line:84%
because there is an emerging
philosophy in science--

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know we were
going to talk about this,

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.792 align:middle line:90%
but I would like to mention it.

00:20:55.792 --> 00:20:58.040 align:middle line:84%
There's an emerging
philosophy in science

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness informs
itself through the things

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:90%
that it creates.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is
what we typically think

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:84%
of as entertainment--
books, music, films,

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:90%
all these things--

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:84%
they may be entertaining,
but this philosophy

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
says that all those
things we create

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.830 align:middle line:84%
are us creating outside
of us something that we

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
want to remind ourselves
of from within.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So technology that we
create is reminding us

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:90%
of our inner technology.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the movies that
are the most popular movies

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Some of them, by surprise--

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.858 align:middle line:84%
the movie "The
Matrix" reminding us

00:21:39.858 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that there's a world we
can't see that influences

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.700 align:middle line:90%
the world we can.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:84%
The movie "Avatar" reminding us
of our relationship to nature.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And the young people, the
movies they're drawn to now

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:84%
are all about superheroes
with superpowers,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:90%
because I believe--

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe
and I don't know

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that there's science
behind my belief--

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle line:84%
but my experience is when
I'm with young people who

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
see those, it touches
something so deep

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:84%
within them, maybe a
memory, that they have

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.740 align:middle line:84%
or they aspire to
those abilities.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Again,
are we reminding

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
ourselves of our soft technology
through the films that we make?

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's all happening
right now, Regina.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:90%
This is all converging.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen quickly.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:90%
We can't drag this out.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.160 align:middle line:84%
In one generation,
we will decide

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:34.940 align:middle line:84%
do we give our humanness away to
machines, to AI, to technology,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:84%
or do we allow that
technology to serve us

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:84%
in a very conscious
way while honoring

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.170 align:middle line:84%
the precious gift of what
it means to be pure human?

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And this is what--

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: That's the battle.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.503 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know in
an even smaller and more

00:22:49.503 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:84%
pedestrian way, but
still in a profound way,

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:84%
we're watching this battle
play out over the vaccine.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're watching
people line up and take sides.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Do we do what our
governments order us to do?

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Are we willing to make the
sacrifice if you don't do this?

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to not
be issued the card that

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
says you can cross over
international borders?

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Now we're getting into
times-- these are real now.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
This used to be the stuff
of movies, sci-fi and such.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
It's real now and we have
to make these choices.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But at what point
will you allow-- not

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
allow yourself to be
manipulated if you don't feel

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:90%
something is right for you?

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have to use
these instincts now,

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.815 align:middle line:84%
because we can't rely
on media anymore.

00:23:33.815 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, everyone
learns differently.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And I would
never tell anyone--

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
try to convince or persuade
anyone of anything.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But my experience, Regina,
is when the facts are clear--

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.495 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --our
choices become obvious.

00:23:46.495 --> 00:23:49.010 align:middle line:10%
And when the facts
are clear of, first

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:10%
of all, the fact that
whatever is made out there

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.260 align:middle line:10%
mimics what we already do.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.475 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So here's
the question,

00:23:56.475 --> 00:23:58.712 align:middle line:84%
and this is a tough one
for a lot of people.

00:23:58.712 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:84%
This is what's up
for us right now.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Do we love ourselves enough
to live our lives in a way

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and give our bodies
what they need to do

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:90%
what they were designed to do?

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.228 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
the big question.

00:24:10.228 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Do we have faith
in the magnificence

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:90%
of what we actually are?

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Do we love
ourselves enough to make

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:90%
that a priority in our lives?

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.410 align:middle line:84%
If the answer is no,
then maybe some people

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:90%
feel they need those vaccines.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:22.535 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But if
the answer is yes--

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
but how many people
have said, wow, I've

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.540 align:middle line:90%
never thought about it that way?

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
No one ever told me that
I'm soft technology.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.570 align:middle line:84%
No one ever told me that
I could self-regulate

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:84%
3.5 trillion volts of electrical
potential in my immune system.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever told me that.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And once they begin to see
that, they think of themselves

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:44.490 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And this is changing our story.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:84%
The new human story is a
story of self-regulation

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.900 align:middle line:90%
of our biology.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.110 align:middle line:84%
We are the only form
of life, that we

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.630 align:middle line:84%
know of today, that
can consciously

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:90%
self-regulate our own biology.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Up-regulate, down-regulate
genes-- we're

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.397 align:middle line:84%
talking about not
only neuroplasticity,

00:25:05.397 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:84%
but we're talking
about bioplasticity.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We're talking
about genetic plasticity.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can
overwrite programs.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I mean, think
about what that means to us.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
begin to look at the machines.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:90%
The machines are limited.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to sense
into other realms of reality

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and other forms of life
that AI programs may not

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:90%
have that ability.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:90%
And to adjust on the fly.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Can I go somewhere
that we didn't talk about going

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
at all, but I
think it might be--

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I told you,
go anywhere you want.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:90%
I'll go there with you.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is really,
really interesting,

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:84%
because different people have
different feelings about this.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:84%
A dear friend of mine
who passed recently was--

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:84%
spent her entire life
working with people

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
who felt and
believed they'd been

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:90%
abducted against their will--

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.907 align:middle line:84%
their conscious will--
by alien abductions.

00:26:00.907 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: John Mack, a
lot of studies on it.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You know I toured
with John Mack before he died?

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I know
because I met you--

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: That's right.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --way back then--

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: That's right.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and before he died.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.515 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, John Mack--

00:26:08.515 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I met both of you.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: John Mack
was part of that.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So here's
why I'm saying this.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.625 align:middle line:84%
As different as those abduction
stories have been over decades

00:26:16.625 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:90%
now-- we're talking--

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these go back decades.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
There are common threads
that run through all of them.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:84%
One of the common
threads that this woman--

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:84%
she was a therapist--
that shared with me--

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:90%
and this is fascinating--

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:84%
was that each of her clients
asked the abductors, why me?

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Why did you choose me?

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:90%
And what do you--

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:84%
what are you doing with
me and with my body?

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And they all gave
the same answer.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And what they said
was that we were once

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
at a point in our evolution
where you are right now,

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:55.720 align:middle line:84%
where we had to choose between
technology and biology.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.210 align:middle line:90%
We chose the technological path.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And we now are sorry
that we've done that.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.872 align:middle line:84%
We have lost something
and we want it back.

00:27:04.872 --> 00:27:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I'm getting
chills, because that is--

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.705 align:middle line:84%
from everything I've read-- and
I've done a lot of work in that

00:27:09.705 --> 00:27:10.660 align:middle line:90%
world, too--

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that is the story
that keeps coming up.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, and
there's another story

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:15.750 align:middle line:90%
with time travelers.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.250 align:middle line:84%
People who have reported time
travelers from the future that

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.670 align:middle line:84%
have come back and said we
chose the technological path.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.740 align:middle line:90%
We lost the essence of our joy.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.600 align:middle line:84%
We lost the essence of
intimate human relationships

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:90%
and we want those back.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So they're asking us, pleading
with us in this time space

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:39.160 align:middle line:84%
continuum to honor the
humanness within us.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't say those
are 100% science.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:90%
But they all feed in--

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:84%
it's all happening
at the same time.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let me play
devil's advocate for a moment.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.412 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
those who are actually

00:27:49.412 --> 00:27:51.310 align:middle line:84%
trying to manipulate
consciousness away

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:84%
from that and toward that very
same agenda again, as what

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.200 align:middle line:84%
happened in those
other cultures--

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:84%
off-planet cultures at
other points in time.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The thinking has been
in these other traditions--

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.520 align:middle line:84%
in the transhuman
tradition-- that the act--

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:84%
the very fact of being a human,
it means that we are imperfect.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.130 align:middle line:84%
That carbon-based
life is flawed.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.410 align:middle line:90%
This is the thinking.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And that we now are evolving
to improve upon and replace

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:90%
that flawed life.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.840 align:middle line:84%
They view sex, for
example, as a distraction.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying if we
can take emotion and sex out

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.550 align:middle line:84%
of our culture, think how
much better we're going to be.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.140 align:middle line:90%
We won't have divorces.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:90%
We won't have messy arguments.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And we won't have
all of these things.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.723 align:middle line:90%
This is their perspective.

00:28:42.723 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're certainly
entitled to their perspective.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:84%
But to impose that
thinking upon the--

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're all
interfacing with it now.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Exactly.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everyone's online.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Exactly.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone is
subject now to manipulation.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think one of the most
important films of our time

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:84%
was "A Social Dilemma"
for this reason--

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.980 align:middle line:84%
to watch how our minds are
being hijacked and reinforced.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.960 align:middle line:84%
The film "A Social
Dilemma," which came out

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.830 align:middle line:84%
about three months ago,
holy cow, it's someone who

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.170 align:middle line:84%
was with Facebook
said we didn't intend

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:84%
for it to be used
this way initially,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.800 align:middle line:90%
but this is what's happened.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And it talks about-- and
it's kind of interesting

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
the way they lay it out
in a format of some people

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:84%
at the control
center of your brain

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:28.000 align:middle line:84%
that are taking in data,
watching a human family.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And it shows how data
is brought to you,

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.240 align:middle line:84%
the algorithms then see your
preference by your clicks,

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:84%
reinforced, drawing in more
sites, more products that

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.840 align:middle line:90%
reinforce the same thing.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So everyone's in a bubble of
their own algorithmic creation

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.910 align:middle line:84%
that is constantly
reinforced and validated

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.505 align:middle line:84%
and becomes their
only known reality.

00:29:47.505 --> 00:29:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But it just
happened-- it just happened--

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I just ordered a
supplement online--

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.068 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --last week
before I came here and--

00:29:57.068 --> 00:29:58.360 align:middle line:90%
actually to bring on this trip.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.890 align:middle line:84%
It was an immune
support supplement.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:05.920 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes after I ordered, I
went back online and there was

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.300 align:middle line:90%
an ad for the same supplement.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:07.960 align:middle line:90%
I said I just bought this.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just bought it.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And now they're
showing it to me again.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:11.972 align:middle line:90%
And that just reinforces.

00:30:11.972 --> 00:30:14.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's even
more intelligent now where

00:30:14.055 --> 00:30:14.950 align:middle line:90%
It's getting more--

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:84%
its own-- it's growing itself
as an artificial network based

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:24.580 align:middle line:84%
on repetitive patterns to
the extent where now it's

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.810 align:middle line:84%
programming us instead
of the other way around.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:90%
It is--

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.047 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --terrifying
because people

00:30:30.047 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:90%
don't know the difference.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:84%
They think they're getting
a spectrum of information.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, this--

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're not.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.162 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is what
Elon Musk is saying.

00:30:36.162 --> 00:30:37.775 align:middle line:84%
He says we need
to regulate this.

00:30:37.775 --> 00:30:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You know,
but I'm an optimist

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and I think there's something
good coming from this.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm also a realist.

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And realistically I think
we're going to go through--

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:51.770 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go through
this passage, this journey.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And if we can do
it consciously, I

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:84%
think something good is
going to come from this.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.460 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I see happening.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Very quickly-- I'm not talking
about a long period of time.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.362 align:middle line:84%
We are now evolving
two parallel societies.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to say.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.272 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing a bifurcation
of consciousness.

00:31:08.272 --> 00:31:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But it's happening
even at the family unit.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: There are
kids at the dinner

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.973 align:middle line:84%
table with the
moms and dads that

00:31:13.973 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:90%
are thinking so differently.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.840 align:middle line:90%
So two parallel societies.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.810 align:middle line:90%
One society is all in.

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.810 align:middle line:84%
They are all in on the
chemical in the body.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.400 align:middle line:90%
They are all in on AI.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:90%
They're all in on technology.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
segment, Regina,

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.880 align:middle line:84%
that maybe has been on
the fence in the past.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.580 align:middle line:84%
But I've had people say this
to me even in the last week,

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
even on the airport
on the trip coming up.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Something doesn't feel right.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: This is
out of control.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And what it's doing is it's
triggering them to go back--

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and they said this-- we need
to go back to the basics.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:45.460 align:middle line:90%
We need to--

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's exactly right.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Nature.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.115 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well,
decentralize everything.

00:31:49.115 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We need
to live locally.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:52.585 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Local food.

00:31:52.585 --> 00:31:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Local energy.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Local commerce.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Local economy.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.443 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Close to nature.

00:31:57.443 --> 00:31:58.595 align:middle line:90%
Follow the natural rhythms.

00:31:58.595 --> 00:31:59.395 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:59.395 --> 00:32:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And so those
two ways of living

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:07.730 align:middle line:84%
are going to progress parallel,
but it won't last long.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Because what will
happen is we're

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.870 align:middle line:84%
going to look at one
another, we're going to say,

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:12.960 align:middle line:90%
who's happier?

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Who's healthier?

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Who's more fulfilled?

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And the answer
to that question, I think,

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.910 align:middle line:84%
will be ultimately what
brings unity to our society.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.630 align:middle line:84%
We are polarized now and
that polarization I think

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:31.280 align:middle line:84%
will continue until we
reach a point where we say,

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.110 align:middle line:84%
we are healthier,
we are happier,

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:34.888 align:middle line:84%
we're more fulfilled
in our lives--

00:32:34.888 --> 00:32:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that
requires self-awareness.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.400 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --do you think
there will be some kind of--

00:32:39.755 --> 00:32:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I think--

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --precipitating event?

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I think this is it.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You think
it is right now?

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You know, this is--
we will look back on this.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:90%
This is a heartbeat in time.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh my god,
yeah, and it's--

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.582 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But when
you're in it, it's

00:32:50.582 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:84%
hard to see it
when you're in it.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Because we are--

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.320 align:middle line:84%
it takes such a
powerful being to be

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:84%
where we are, to live in a world
with all that we have known,

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and become accustomed to,
and felt that we mastered,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:84%
suddenly pulled
out from under us.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.370 align:middle line:90%
But the new is not quite there.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And we're still every day,
we're trying to make a living,

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.840 align:middle line:84%
have some semblance of a healthy
intimate human relationship,

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:84%
take care of our bodies,
and find joy in our lives.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Even with a powerful being,
it takes to be in that place,

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:84%
because the future is
not known right now--

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.610 align:middle line:90%
and this is the beauty--

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.220 align:middle line:90%
because it's not yet created.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:84%
We are creating that future
through the choices we make now

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding
of the new human story.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Self-regulation of our
biology is a foundation.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a
little satellite.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the foundation of
this new human story.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know what the
new world is going to be.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:51.617 align:middle line:84%
I have my personal
bias and suspicion,

00:33:51.617 --> 00:33:52.700 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know for sure.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.590 align:middle line:90%
But I do know this--

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:84%
if we build that new
world out of fear,

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:00.370 align:middle line:84%
it's going to look just
like the old world.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But if we take this time,
this precious window of time

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.422 align:middle line:84%
that we have right now,
and if we come together

00:34:07.422 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and look at one
another in the eyes

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.409 align:middle line:84%
just like we're doing now
with our community and say,

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:13.540 align:middle line:84%
these are the things
that we value,

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.560 align:middle line:84%
these are the things
that we cherish in life,

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.239 align:middle line:84%
and whatever is going to
happen from this point forward,

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:24.810 align:middle line:84%
if these values and the
things that we cherish,

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:28.860 align:middle line:84%
if they can be the foundation
and we build everything around

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.670 align:middle line:90%
that, we can't go wrong.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But if we lose sight of
those precious values,

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I think we will be
following the path

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.860 align:middle line:84%
that either the
abductors were following

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:84%
or maybe the time
travelers were following.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- yeah, it's
up for us right now.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I totally
agree with that.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.175 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Yeah, this
isn't science fiction--

00:34:47.175 --> 00:34:47.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
at a choice point.

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:48.449 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --five years from now.

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:50.657 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When I saw the
bifurcation of consciousness

00:34:50.657 --> 00:34:53.489 align:middle line:84%
and such extreme forms where
family members and people could

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:84%
no longer talk to each other,
both believing they were

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:84%
absolutely right, this
is this rigidity--

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:03.390 align:middle line:84%
again, reinforced by
media, social media.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It's being reinforced
through our interface,

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.548 align:middle line:90%
through technology.

00:35:06.548 --> 00:35:07.840 align:middle line:90%
That's how this happened to me.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:12.817 align:middle line:84%
But what I started noticing
also was the responsibility

00:35:12.817 --> 00:35:14.400 align:middle line:84%
that was falling on
people's shoulders

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:90%
that recognized it and said no.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to
live in an area--

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.320 align:middle line:90%
the Sierra Nevada foothills--

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.050 align:middle line:84%
everyone moving in-- the
old generation is dying off,

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:24.220 align:middle line:90%
the original farmers.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.050 align:middle line:90%
The new ones are coming in.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:84%
People with literally--
my neighbors

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.110 align:middle line:84%
have six to seven kids
per family coming in,

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.330 align:middle line:84%
having their kids get
their fingers in the dirt.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:35.980 align:middle line:90%
Now, some of it is religion.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Some of it is religious sects.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But teaching their children that
to live in concert with nature,

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and to go out and play in
the grass and in the trees

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.880 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation
like it was back

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.400 align:middle line:84%
when I was growing up,
and away from technology.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm watching that all around me.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing their conversations
in the coffee shops.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in a rural area
in a progressive state.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's becoming obvious
that people are choosing away

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.377 align:middle line:90%
from technology there.

00:36:03.377 --> 00:36:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
the norm, though.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't reflect everywhere.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I live in New Mexico.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It's a large state,
relatively small population.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.875 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Same thing.

00:36:10.875 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:84%
It is-- politically, it's
considered a blue state.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the map, the blue

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.160 align:middle line:84%
is a couple of cities and the
rest of the state is red--

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --which is the same
in many of these other places.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.217 align:middle line:90%
How do you unify when--

00:36:23.217 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is the tough one.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.217 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I know,
this is the tough one,

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:29.710 align:middle line:84%
because the information-- this
is the battle for our thoughts.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The information is
being so tightly regulated.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.710 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you
what I'm seeing

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.810 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of people have
information fatigue.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They simply
have shut it off.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the healthiest
thing that we can do right now.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Except for Gaia TV.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:45.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it would--

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: No, because we're
talking about real things on--

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.193 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --Gaia TV.

00:36:49.193 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
But they've shut
off the information.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And this includes
their social media.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Because
what will happen

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.920 align:middle line:84%
is they'll have one group
of friends on Facebook

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that will post all
this information

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and these people are accustomed
to accepting and believing

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.360 align:middle line:90%
what their friends have said.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Then they see
reports on YouTube,

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and then they see
the Twitter channels,

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:90%
and the Twitter feeds.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they sit down
with their family at dinner

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.380 align:middle line:90%
and they say, what's true?

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.380 align:middle line:90%
What do I believe?

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And this
is-- emotionally

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.010 align:middle line:90%
it will wear you out.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:25.410 align:middle line:84%
It's polarizing families
and friendships.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Some of those are blowing up.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Marriages are blowing up.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Children are not hanging out
with their parents anymore.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And I think
this is the trigger.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.797 align:middle line:84%
People only-- it's like
a rubber band, Regina,

00:37:36.797 --> 00:37:37.755 align:middle line:90%
that's just stretched--

00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:39.268 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --to the max.

00:37:39.268 --> 00:37:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think the break
point is the fatigue.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And people are saying,
something's not right.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:45.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.535 align:middle line:84%
But that's the door to the
awakening if they say--

00:37:48.535 --> 00:37:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They say, I
don't know what it is,

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.170 align:middle line:90%
but something isn't right.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And they just shut it all off.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But we control it.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And then they find
out what's true in their lives.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:56.235 --> 00:37:57.318 align:middle line:90%
In the end, it's up to us.

00:37:57.318 --> 00:37:59.670 align:middle line:84%
If we don't support those
platforms, they go away,

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:03.210 align:middle line:84%
or they reform, or
transform to supply us

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:06.060 align:middle line:84%
with what we're actually
looking for and it's not this.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Right now information is biased
because it profits any given

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:15.500 align:middle line:84%
platform to hold a very
distinct point of view.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
they keep their support.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.713 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But a very cool
thing that's happening--

00:38:19.713 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and I could see this
starting years ago--

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:84%
the same technology
is now being used

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:29.660 align:middle line:84%
to develop new platforms
outside of Silicon

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Valley, outside of
the control structure

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.560 align:middle line:90%
where people have the freedom.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.643 align:middle line:90%
They're not de-platformed.

00:38:34.643 --> 00:38:35.643 align:middle line:90%
And those are emerging--

00:38:35.643 --> 00:38:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing emerging
in Europe right now.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:39.150 align:middle line:90%
There are new European models.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I know people in the
US a little bit--

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:43.416 align:middle line:90%
not quite as ready--

00:38:43.416 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us an example
of when it functions like--

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:47.630 align:middle line:90%
one of these.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.922 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, it looks like--

00:38:48.922 --> 00:38:51.300 align:middle line:84%
it's an internet platform
where people communicate,

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.550 align:middle line:90%
but they're not de-platformed.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So you can share
information freely.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.007 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: And you're not--

00:38:57.007 --> 00:38:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Regulated.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --shamed.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:01.082 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You're not shamed
because of a belief system.

00:39:01.082 --> 00:39:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
powerful social motivator

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.300 align:middle line:90%
for some people.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Now, you and I are
of a different generation.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And we've lived-- we've seen
many crises in our lives.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But to a young person
who is conditioned

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:84%
to place their value in
the way that they perceive

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:24.290 align:middle line:84%
other people think of them,
and to have their friends

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:29.930 align:middle line:84%
shame them on Twitter a
lot, or on Facebook-- and we

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
all know the rate of teen
suicides is on the rise.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is contributing,
because young people who

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.250 align:middle line:84%
feel that they have no value
in the eyes of their friends

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.540 align:middle line:90%
feel they're not worth a life.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.048 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And they're
taking their lives.

00:39:45.048 --> 00:39:47.690 align:middle line:84%
But this all goes back
to the human story.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:50.420 align:middle line:84%
When we're taught
from an early age

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.770 align:middle line:84%
that we're the product of an
accident, random mutations

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.590 align:middle line:84%
of biology, where's the
specialness in that?

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you are just
a random life form,

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.980 align:middle line:84%
then there's no reason
to respect your body.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And the young people
don't have that reasoning.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So what they place
into their body--

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.280 align:middle line:84%
not all young people--
but we see this happening.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.570 align:middle line:90%
The drug abuse, for example.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:19.340 align:middle line:84%
To young people who learn
how precious life is

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and how to respect
their bodies, they

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:24.530 align:middle line:84%
would never put those chemicals
into their bodies, pure--

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:26.120 align:middle line:84%
not because they're
not exposed to it,

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.350 align:middle line:84%
but purely out of the inner
reverence for their own being.

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:90%
But that's been lost.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
different kind of education

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and that does have to be
built from the ground up now.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.125 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But it
begins with biology.

00:40:36.125 --> 00:40:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: It begins-- our young
people are taught that nature--

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental rule
of nature is based

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.630 align:middle line:90%
on competition and conflict.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.018 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's wrong.

00:40:46.018 --> 00:40:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The best science of
the modern world is now showing

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.590 align:middle line:90%
us nature--

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Collaboration.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.305 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: --nature is
based on cooperation.

00:40:51.305 --> 00:40:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And if someone
doesn't believe that,

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:57.770 align:middle line:84%
they need look no further
than the 50 trillion cells

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.420 align:middle line:84%
in their body that
must cooperate

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.860 align:middle line:90%
in every moment of every day.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.440 align:middle line:84%
We live this model
of cooperation

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.290 align:middle line:90%
to remind ourselves.

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But think what
that means to a young person.

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:12.590 align:middle line:84%
If you grow up understanding
that nature is your friend,

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:16.700 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have to fight to
defend yourself from the world,

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and that cooperation and
working with other people

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.700 align:middle line:84%
is reflecting that
fundamental rule of nature,

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.800 align:middle line:84%
that's very different-- what I
grew up with was dog eat dog.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You have to roll
over the people around you

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:32.095 align:middle line:90%
to get anywhere in the world.

00:41:32.095 --> 00:41:33.220 align:middle line:90%
That was what I was taught.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.053 align:middle line:90%
I never believed it.

00:41:34.053 --> 00:41:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I have a very
strong soul compass

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.630 align:middle line:90%
and I rejected that belief.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:40.160 align:middle line:90%
A lot of my friends did not.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So this begins at
a very early age

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:47.640 align:middle line:84%
of helping young people to
find a different way to think

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.440 align:middle line:90%
about themselves.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.210 align:middle line:90%
A new human story.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.572 align:middle line:84%
And that's all up
for us right now.

00:41:52.572 --> 00:41:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It really is,
because the old stories

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:55.760 align:middle line:90%
don't work anymore.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.240 align:middle line:84%
They stayed stories of
our educational systems

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and our religious institutions
are really too myopic.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.300 align:middle line:84%
They're not taking into
account our full potential.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.758 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as
though there has

00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:11.040 align:middle line:84%
been a restrictor a limiter put
on the human species for ages.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, in a sense
we've done it to ourselves

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and now we can
break free of that.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I hope we're
breaking free of it.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.275 align:middle line:90%
There is the battle in academia.

00:42:19.275 --> 00:42:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's a big one.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: They're fighting
tooth and nail to hang on

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:24.895 align:middle line:90%
to an obsolete story.

00:42:24.895 --> 00:42:25.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:25.695 --> 00:42:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Regina, they're
teaching in our universities

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:29.860 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.810 align:middle line:84%
The young people
that are being asked

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to solve the problems that
we've created in the world--

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:36.880 align:middle line:84%
they're being asked to
solve those problems

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.610 align:middle line:84%
through the same thinking
that led to the problems.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying to throw
all of the old academia out,

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:47.260 align:middle line:84%
but I believe in honoring
our young people.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Give them everything.

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Give them the old ideas.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Given them the new ideas.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And let them know that science
is a living way of thinking

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:90%
about themselves in the world.

00:42:59.130 --> 00:42:59.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not static.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:00.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not fixed.

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly
being upgraded when

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.630 align:middle line:90%
new discoveries come about.

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's threatening to the
academias as we know it today.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So we have-- literally,
we have to reconstruct

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.270 align:middle line:84%
all of these systems
from the ground up.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But that starts with
us as individuals.

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And that starts with
our own maturity.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And we just have time for
this one last little thing

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.050 align:middle line:90%
to chat about.

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is including the
spiritual and metaphysical

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:25.110 align:middle line:90%
communities.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Once we started--

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.550 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago, when we really
all started hopping on in mass,

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:31.590 align:middle line:90%
we started hopping on--

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The
harmonic convergence.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was there.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:90%
I was up on Shasta.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So we were all hopping
on and we're all

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:40.780 align:middle line:84%
learning how to see
that there's more to us

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.100 align:middle line:90%
than just the material part.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And we've learned to meditate.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.120 align:middle line:84%
We've learned to find our
little bubbles of bliss.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But what's happened is
we've reached a point now

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.410 align:middle line:84%
where that has to be
brought back in and applied

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and grounded in our
families, in our communities

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.610 align:middle line:84%
with responsible action,
which was what a lot of people

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:03.220 align:middle line:84%
were turning away from and
wanted to get blissed out

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.930 align:middle line:90%
to leave behind.

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:08.620 align:middle line:84%
How do you suggest we begin
using this practically now?

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think it's
we're the-- it's where

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.810 align:middle line:90%
the rubber meets the road.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The spiritual
rubber of our beliefs

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.730 align:middle line:90%
meets the road of everyday life.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Life.

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.527 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And I think
what's happening--

00:44:19.527 --> 00:44:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing this happen in
the spiritual community-- is

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.940 align:middle line:84%
some of the principles
that they've been

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.630 align:middle line:90%
led to believe are not true.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And so
their belief systems,

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.900 align:middle line:84%
when they're challenged
with the changing world,

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.730 align:middle line:84%
their belief systems
no longer serve them.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:35.470 align:middle line:84%
The belief systems
are breaking down.

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And they're saying, now what?

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Now what do I do?

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It's an opportunity for us to
see what works, what doesn't.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.360 align:middle line:84%
What doesn't work, don't
put any more energy into it.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But I think this is
important, Regina,

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:49.930 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge to be kind to
ourselves and one another.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.920 align:middle line:90%
We're on a learning curve.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.105 align:middle line:90%
It's a steep learning curve.

00:44:53.105 --> 00:44:55.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An explosive
learning curve right now.

00:44:55.105 --> 00:44:55.905 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It is.

00:44:55.905 --> 00:44:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But not to judge
ourselves for the choices

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.290 align:middle line:84%
that have been made in the past
based upon what we knew then.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:03.850 align:middle line:90%
We know more now.

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So we say we let that
past go gracefully.

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:07.270 align:middle line:90%
This is what we know now.

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:09.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's build a new human story.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's build a new world
based upon the values

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.500 align:middle line:90%
that we cherish.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be amazed when you ask
someone to define their values,

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:19.750 align:middle line:84%
they've never even
thought about it.

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin
talking about it,

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:24.980 align:middle line:84%
they say, oh my god, this is
the foundation of everything.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: The most radical
thing that we can do

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:31.220 align:middle line:84%
is to think for ourselves
and to think differently.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is the challenge
that's up for everyone

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:37.550 align:middle line:84%
right now to be truthful,
honest, and factual.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:38.350 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Truthful, honest, and
factual with ourselves

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.430 align:middle line:90%
and what we face.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And then to apply our
best practices, our best

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:52.137 align:middle line:84%
discernment, the best judgment
in the world based upon those.

00:45:52.137 --> 00:45:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:55.350 align:middle line:90%
It's time to go old school.

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Go back into the virtues,
the great virtues,

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:02.580 align:middle line:84%
because some of that does
require courage, for example.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the subtlety of those
virtues will help lift us.

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Once we define what our
values are, can help

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:10.660 align:middle line:84%
take us into the
manifested version of that.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I agree.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- I think of this
often, it's like a pendulum.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And we launched
after World War II.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.760 align:middle line:84%
For a lot of reasons, we were
inundated with technology

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.750 align:middle line:90%
that we'd never seen.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: And we explored that.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And the pendulum
has gone so far,

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:29.760 align:middle line:84%
now the technology threatens
our very existence.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.530 align:middle line:90%
It threatens our species.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:84%
We'll never lose the
tech, but how we apply

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:37.620 align:middle line:84%
it will be that
pendulum coming back.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.600 align:middle line:84%
We are maturing in
the common sense,

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.210 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, of what
it means to be human

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and how we embrace the
technology in our lives.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Gregg--

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And that's what the
new human story is all about.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.590 align:middle line:90%
This is show time.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And everything you
said, I resonate with.

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:53.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to start
making these decisions

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.360 align:middle line:90%
and standing up for ourselves.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Regina, I know
our time is brief here.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.370 align:middle line:90%
I knew it would go by quickly.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:46:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: But I just--

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for the opportunity,

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.880 align:middle line:90%
first, to work together again.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it was fun.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.372 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: For the invitation
to be with you today

00:47:05.372 --> 00:47:10.860 align:middle line:10%
and to have this very
honest conversation that can

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.210 align:middle line:10%
be frightening for some people.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:13.500 align:middle line:90%
And it is also--

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.310 align:middle line:90%
opens the door.

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:15.110 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:17.085 align:middle line:84%
It opens the door
to new possibilities

00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:18.215 align:middle line:90%
that are very exciting.

00:47:18.215 --> 00:47:19.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.600 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: So thank you for the
work you do and for bringing

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.850 align:middle line:10%
truthful, honest, and
factual information--

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:24.150 align:middle line:10%

And people are going to
be able to stay dialed in

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.920 align:middle line:84%
with you, because you've
got a lot of research

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.253 align:middle line:90%
that you're releasing right now.

00:47:33.253 --> 00:47:34.890 align:middle line:90%
