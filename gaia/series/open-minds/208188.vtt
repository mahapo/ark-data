LARSON: When you're

00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:15.360 align:middle line:84%
thinking and feeling and
needing to know an answer,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.130 align:middle line:84%
nature will give
you that answer.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why
it's so important

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:84%
not to let our fears, our
anxiety, or our anger,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.900 align:middle line:90%
or our grief lead the way.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:84%
That's a big mistake when we
let those dramatic emotions run

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:90%
the show.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we can
play with that uncertainty

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.988 align:middle line:84%
principle, play with
the quantum physics,

00:00:33.988 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:84%
play with the entanglement,
recognize relationships matter,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:90%
the questions matter.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And we can guide ourselves
in a positive way out of it.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:84%
The key is to rise above
those knee-jerk reactions

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
that we often have so that we
can start feeling that higher

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.825 align:middle line:90%
level self that we can get.

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:84%

happened to me this last 24

things you're grateful for--

>>REGINA MEREDITH: That's huge.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
That gets toward,
how good can it get?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Your frame of mind,
where you're coming from,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
the questions
you're asking, what

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking,
how you're feeling

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.235 align:middle line:84%
will absolutely
affect the outcome.

>>REGINA: In my previous
shows with Cynthia Sue Larson,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:10%
we spoke about
intriguing concepts

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:10%
such as the Mandela effect,
quantum jumping, and reality

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.510 align:middle line:10%
shifts.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
drill down deeper

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:84%
into the quantum nature of
our reality or unreality,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:90%
depending on where we stand.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Cynthia.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:90%
What a year.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.715 align:middle line:90%
It's been a crazy year.

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
You went through
COVID, long-haulers.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was a challenge, but
you saw all of the gifts in it.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.198 align:middle line:84%
You saw what the underlying
nature of that reality was.

00:01:46.198 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
A little bit later can we
talk about some of that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe, for other people who've
been through this journey?

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:90%
It's affecting so many people.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to write that down.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:90%
We'll bookmark it for later.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But right now, you
and I agreed what

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
we want to talk about
is this whole thing that

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
seems to be-- well, it's being
called the post-truth era.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
way you phrase it,

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is a
question you posed.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Is quantum uncertainty
driving truth wars?

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.848 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to
unpack there and I

00:02:16.848 --> 00:02:19.057 align:middle line:84%
want to spend some time on
it, because everyone says,

00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the truth is anymore.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:90%
This is everywhere.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, first of all,
I think definition of terms

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:90%
would be good.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Do.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:10%
Quantum uncertainty is
basically an intrinsic part

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:10%
of quantum physics,
the quantum paradigm.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:10%
Even since Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:10%
that so many people
are familiar with,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:10%
we're aware that you can't
know both the position

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:10%
and momentum of a quantum
particle, for example.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So that phrase,
quantum uncertainty,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is definitely understood in
the realm of quantum physics.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Now we're taking it a little
bit outside the typical realm

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics and moving
it into these truth wars, which

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
is where people believe that
facts are a certain way,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and that they can't change
or that they don't change,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and that there is such a
thing as objective reality.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But what we're learning from
quantum physics as we go

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
is that that may
not be the case.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when we recognize that
quantum physics is showing us

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
that there is such a thing
as subjective reality,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:84%
subjective awareness, and
it's not just one physicist

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:90%
saying that.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And uncertainty
at the base of everything.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Uncertainty at
the base of everything.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And this is a very
key concept to soak in and allow

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
to percolate,
because a lot of us--

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
it flies in the face of
what we think is true.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
We think that there is one
fixed, objective reality,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
because we're so anchored
in this material realism,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:84%
this classical mindset,
which is actually,

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:84%
in my way of looking at it, a
subset of the greater quantum

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
logic, the greater
quantum paradigm, which is

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:90%
much more of the universal set.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk about
a theory of everything,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:84%
you need to look at, how
do these two intertwine,

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:90%
interrelate?

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm
learning and what I'm

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:84%
seeing, and from physicists such
as Lucien Hardy, who basically

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
said that you can derive
all of quantum physics

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:84%
from six simple axioms, that's
a good thing, because then you

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
can say, well, if you can
do that, then you can say,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
within that might be
the classical paradigm.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
all of this put

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:84%
together so that all
physicists agree.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But we're starting to get many
physicists like Carlo Rovelli,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Tom Campbell, and
several others saying

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, the idea of
subjective realities

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.333 align:middle line:84%
looks like that is
the case, that is--

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rather than
objective reality.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.885 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And before people
would say, of course there's

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:90%
objective reality.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.810 align:middle line:84%
We all live in this little
village called whatnot.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.910 align:middle line:84%
This person over here
owns the pharmacy,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and this person over here
has the daycare center,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
banker, and you all

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
go to the same church
on Sunday together.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And that seemed
to be-- there was

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.290 align:middle line:84%
a kind of agreed-upon stability
that everyone recognized

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:84%
their place and
what each other did

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and what each other even
believed to a large extent.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:90%
That's gone.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to a large
extent, that perception

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:84%
of that stable reality
seems to be gone now where

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:90%
family members, members of--

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:84%
co-workers, members
of organizations,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:84%
churches, spiritual groups
can't agree on much of anything

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.517 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's true.

00:05:31.517 --> 00:05:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now I
want to go further

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.700 align:middle line:84%
into it, because there's
a lot of programming.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:84%
The film on "Social
Dilemma" I think certainly

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
showed us part of how
these camps of truth

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:84%
seem to be taking shape, because
we're being subconsciously

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:90%
molded and programmed.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Take it away from there.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, well
that documentary that

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
you're referring to is
such a great example,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:84%
because even if people
haven't seen it yet,

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
"The Social Dilemma," it shows
without a doubt that we are

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
being impacted without most
people's conscious awareness--

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or permission.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Or permission.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And then when you see
the developers of some

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:84%
of these social platforms do not
allow their own children to use

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.040 align:middle line:84%
these platforms,
then you can start

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:90%
to see, what is going on here?

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of terrifying when you
think about the implications.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So the implications
are that our worldview,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
our narratives are being
shaped to a large degree

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:84%
by what we consider to be truth,
the narrative that we agree on,

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.880 align:middle line:84%
the socially agreed
upon reality or facts.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And as individual observers,
it's always been the case--

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
we knew it was the case that
what I think of as blue,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.542 align:middle line:90%
you might--

00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, you think
it's the same thing,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:90%
but we don't know for sure.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And we were OK with that
as long as, like you said,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.010 align:middle line:84%
the baker has agreed
to be the baker and--

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has kind of something
we can define and count

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:90%
on day in and day out.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So it gets interesting
when we have

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.320 align:middle line:84%
the idea that these other forms
of collective consciousness

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.865 align:middle line:84%
have come on the scene,
kind of snuck on the scene.

00:07:10.865 --> 00:07:12.565 align:middle line:90%
I'm not naming the social media.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really matter
which ones they are.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
But any time you get an
aggregate, a collective

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.540 align:middle line:84%
of people and there's
somebody shaping

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:84%
what's being allowed to be
put forth on that platform

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
or not allowed,
whoever those are,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
the gatekeepers of
those platforms,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:84%
they are to a large
degree shaping

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.480 align:middle line:90%
the way people view the truth.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now it's
becoming-- but that's now

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.960 align:middle line:90%
shaping subjective reality.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It is.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's much bigger than any
simple political difference.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's even a bigger
situation than just two

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:90%
political parties or--

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Way deeper.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It's way
more than that.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's way bigger.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the most common
thing I hear people say,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.888 align:middle line:84%
no matter what their
beliefs on anything,

00:07:55.888 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
which can be
anything now, is gee,

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know what
to believe anymore.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And people are starting to
doubt their own doctors,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:84%
their own medical
establishment, because they've

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:84%
been through things,
and they felt

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.570 align:middle line:84%
like they were being gaslighted
by the medical practitioners

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
they were seeing who were not
believing what they were saying

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
about their long-haul symptoms
and that kind of thing.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.310 align:middle line:84%
That's a group that I've
just been exposed to.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.768 align:middle line:84%
I've been part of
that community,

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still part
of that community.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I feel like those people
don't feel understood.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.473 align:middle line:90%
They feel like they've been--

00:08:28.473 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
like they're not understood
by their families,

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
by their neighbors, not
even by their doctors.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.757 align:middle line:84%
And that is kind of a massive
letdown for a lot of people.

00:08:36.757 --> 00:08:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
almost like a period

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:90%
of reality deconstruction.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Or was it ever
constructed to begin with?

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just that
we had a simpler time

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:84%
without these social
influences and these media

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:53.403 align:middle line:84%
influences where it appeared we
had a more agreed upon reality?

00:08:53.403 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's what I
would say is the case.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I think as things get more
complicated-- the internet came

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
along, then the various social
media platforms came along.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's been a complexity
that's been increasing.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
If any of us look back
10, 20, 30 years ago,

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.300 align:middle line:84%
even if you watch movies,
period pieces of those times,

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:84%
everyone seems so naive,
so happy-go-lucky.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:90%
"Andy Griffith Show," you know?

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Andy knew everything
pretty much.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:90%
If he didn't, Aunt Bee did.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.595 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Love it.

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And it makes us feel good,
because when you go back

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to a reduction of entropy, when
you back the complexity off

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.945 align:middle line:84%
and you go back to
that sense of just--

00:09:31.945 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:84%
if you go back far
enough, you get back

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:90%
to pure, unconditional love.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
You get back to what the
perennial philosophies talk

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Great
virtues and so forth.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, exactly.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's the actual energy.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not even energy.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the lack of entropy
that drives everything.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's explain
that term, entropy,

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:84%
for those who don't
know it, because it's

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:90%
critical to this conversation.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:90%
So if you look at--

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.770 align:middle line:84%
like, if you've got a cup of
hot beverage or something,

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
you know that over
time it'll get cooler.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:90%
So you just leave it alone.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:90%
You can pick it up later.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:90%
It's cooled off.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you can say,
OK, I can take a sip.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So the second law of
thermodynamics gets into that.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:90%
And we take it for granted.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Of course, that happens.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.690 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
taking for granted

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
is this one-way
direction of time.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that's not necessarily

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:84%
required by quantum physics,
which is interesting.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's something we
take for granted within

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
that little subset,
little bubble

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
of our classical
reality, of everything

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:84%
our senses can measure
and experience.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.132 align:middle line:90%
So what was that term?

00:10:36.132 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One of the simple--

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
one of the simple concepts
is chaos, for example, when

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about entropy.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.388 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about it the way
you were using it a moment ago.

00:10:45.388 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So the
way I'm using it now

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
is looking at the
complexity just with time.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.977 align:middle line:84%
We get more and more things,
more apps on our cell phones--

00:10:53.977 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More potentials.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: More potentials.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:84%
But they start getting
realized, and then we don't even

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.618 align:middle line:90%
know what's going on with it.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
The implications
of the interactions

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:84%
between all these new
technologies, these new ways

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, new social
ways of dealing with things,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.530 align:middle line:84%
it just increasingly leads
to more and more complexity.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would you
then define entropy

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
as more complexity
or more potentials?

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes it's also
synonymous with a more chaotic

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.430 align:middle line:90%
state or a less coherent state.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: There's a tendency
toward chaos, as you say.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:84%
But we can cut
through that noise,

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:90%
through the entanglements.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:84%
That's the relationships
that we have with one

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
another, with the
Earth, with the cosmos.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Those relationships
are everything,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:90%
because they can provide that--

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.110 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call it
an anchor or a sense of,

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
this is something that
holds together here.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.660 align:middle line:84%
This is where we can
experience a sense

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:84%
of shared reality, where we
agree, this is the baker.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the fire
house, and so forth.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we are in
a time of, would you

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:84%
say, from our-- certainly over
the last decades of anybody

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
who's been alive, of
increasing entropy?

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Absolutely.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.263 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing a lot more of that.

00:12:12.263 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:90%
It's always been true.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was exciting around I
think the turn of the century,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:90%
around 1900.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't alive to see
it, but that was huge,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.890 align:middle line:84%
because people were
feeling like, wow.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:90%
The automobile is coming.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.142 align:middle line:84%
We can leave the horses
and buggies behind.

00:12:27.142 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
telephone came along.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.642 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Telephone, yes.

00:12:29.642 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So lots of things that just
started feeling like, wow.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.445 align:middle line:84%
The world is really
getting better, brighter.

00:12:35.445 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
in the 1940s and '50s,

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.232 align:middle line:90%
it really felt that way.

00:12:39.232 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we had "The Andy
Griffith Show" in the '60s.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And all of those days
seem very naive to us

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:84%
now when we're
looking at the issues

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
that we're facing
worldwide, whatever

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:84%
they may be with the
weather, with the pandemic,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
with global warming that
people are concerned about.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Just all of the
environmental issues

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:84%
are in some ways tied to
the complexity or at least

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:90%
our understanding of the world.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
mentioned when it

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
comes to-- a little
while ago, you

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.795 align:middle line:84%
used the term the
theory of everything,

00:13:10.795 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:84%
which Tom Campbell's
book is "My Big Toe,"

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.010 align:middle line:90%
my big theory of everything.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, and
he's a genius physicist.

00:13:17.175 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:84%
He teaches workshops
on remote viewing,

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:90%
because time isn't tangled.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Time isn't one
unidirectional, and so forth.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's just a brilliant
fellow who I haven't

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.540 align:middle line:90%
interviewed for a while.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:84%
I need to have him
back on the show.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing that always
stuck with me in his work

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:84%
when he was describing,
why is a cup a cup,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:90%
why are we perceiving--

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
if this is nothing but particles
or even a little denser atoms,

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.875 align:middle line:84%
and atoms separated at
such great distances

00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:55.030 align:middle line:84%
you practically need to have a
telescope to see them, right?

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're talking about--

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
all of this, everything,
you, me, this cup

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:84%
is nothing but space
with tiny bits of matter

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.950 align:middle line:84%
that somehow we're
perceiving as concrete, real.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:90%
We're drinking out of it.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So he was talking about
this perception of reality

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.982 align:middle line:84%
that he called our
rendering of reality.

00:14:15.982 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
That's a unique term if
you're in the video business,

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.740 align:middle line:84%
because you have all these
pixels and things in the here

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:90%
and there, in the equipment.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it
all comes together

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
through the process of creating
an image as-- the image renders

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:84%
itself into the complete
image it finally becomes.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:84%
First, tell us, what did he mean
by that agreed upon rendering

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
of reality where no matter
where you are in the world,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:90%
this is a cup?

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.298 align:middle line:84%
No matter who you
are, this is a cup.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, what
he meant by it--

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- I don't feel like
I can speak for Tom Campbell,

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:84%
but in general it has
to do with consciousness

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:90%
being fundamental.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Can't get behind consciousness.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.580 align:middle line:84%
That was Max Planck, the
founder of quantum physics

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:90%
that said that.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's very true.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:84%
You really can't go
past consciousness.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what it really means
is that we are rendering

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:90%
all of the shapes and forms.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:90%
This is very much as--

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This has
been agreed upon.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.903 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, it's
been agreed upon,

00:15:12.903 --> 00:15:14.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
shared experience,

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
and so it's something that
we can basically recognize.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that goes back
to what you were just saying.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:84%
The only way to
really have anything

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
we can in our own lives
consider an objective reality

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:84%
is on some level to
have an agreement,

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.640 align:middle line:90%
to have something agreed upon.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to have an
isolated objective reality.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing
with these truth

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.830 align:middle line:84%
wars is we're
seeing a splitting.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:49.170 align:middle line:84%
You can have two
people side by side

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:84%
who are observing something that
one of them would say is a cup

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and the other one would
say, no, that's a mug.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.022 align:middle line:90%
And maybe they're both right.

00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:84%
When you get into
quantum physics--

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They look the same.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah,
they look the same.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you see the handle, then
it goes from a cup to a mug

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.330 align:middle line:90%
maybe.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So your perspective
matters, of course.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
interesting is now

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:84%
we're really
starting to recognize

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:84%
that even if one person
looks for facts to back up

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
an argument, whatever
the argument might be,

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.330 align:middle line:84%
they'll be able to find
that, thanks to the fact

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that nature gives us
what we're asking for.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And social media and
these platforms and algorithms

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:90%
help manifest that for you.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.668 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: They definitely do.

00:16:27.668 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And for anyone
who's using these,

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it's AI or
partly our consciousness,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to witness
some of this very phenomenon.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And the physicist
John Archibald Wheeler

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:84%
was one of the first people
that brought that idea forward,

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:84%
that you can ask
nature a question

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.410 align:middle line:90%
and you can get an answer back.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Then Henry Stapp has
written about that,

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and another physicist.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So there are lots of signs that
this is definitely happening.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.680 align:middle line:90%
You ask nature a question.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you're
researching something.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.222 align:middle line:90%
You're looking for facts.

00:16:58.222 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:84%
You want to back
up your theories--

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your position.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: --whatever
it may be, and you'll

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:90%
find what you're looking for.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:08.895 align:middle line:84%
And you can find very valid,
verifiable facts, which might

00:17:08.895 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:90%
not have been there before.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.924 align:middle line:84%
That's the interesting
thing for me personally.

00:17:11.924 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, go into that,
because that's your bailiwick.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:10%
>>LARSON: Yeah, that's right--

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Jumping
timelines and such.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.332 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:17:19.332 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Have you experienced
that yourself?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Because you research
all the time.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, constantly.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:90%
I do witness this quite a lot.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.033 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
noticing it and you

00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
start recognizing what it is--
like, you look at something

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.915 align:middle line:90%
and you do a double take.

00:17:31.915 --> 00:17:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, that's not what
I thought it was,

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:90%
whether it's a logo or a brand--

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:90%
or it could be anything at all.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Could be a fact in history
is suddenly different.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But any of those cases
tell us that obviously--

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.610 align:middle line:84%
well, previously to
recognizing the Mandela effect,

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:90%
reality shifts.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
looking at, when you

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.650 align:middle line:84%
look at this idea that
you can look for the facts

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.537 align:middle line:90%
that you want--

00:17:53.537 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:84%
it is what you want, because
you're asking the question.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where I
think a lot of people

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:90%
don't realize what's happening.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:84%
If you ask a question that
you don't want the answer to,

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:84%
that's where I would
advise caution, caution.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
We really need to
start asking questions

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.020 align:middle line:90%
we do want the answers to.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.607 align:middle line:84%
So if people are
getting one thing out

00:18:11.607 --> 00:18:13.440 align:middle line:84%
of this whole interview,
I think that should

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:90%
be the big, big takeaway.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And people think,
well, what difference

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:90%
does a question make?

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:90%
It makes all the difference.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just a
thought, just a thought,

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:84%
makes a huge difference
because when you're

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.280 align:middle line:84%
thinking and feeling and
needing to know an answer,

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:84%
nature will give
you that answer.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why
it's so important

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:84%
not to let our fears,
our anxiety, our anger,

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:90%
or our grief lead the way.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:84%
That's a big mistake when we
let those dramatic emotions run

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:90%
the show.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's refer back, just
to kind of seal up

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.690 align:middle line:84%
this portion of the
conversation on the notion

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:90%
of an objective reality.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.382 align:middle line:84%
You said there was
an experiment that

00:18:57.382 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
was done in 2019 that seemed
to lead to the conclusion maybe

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:90%
there isn't objective reality.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about
now is an experiment that

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:84%
was conducted with six
entangled photons in a rendition

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.870 align:middle line:84%
of the double slit
experiment, which

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:90%
is that famous experiment--

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I know we've talked
about it before.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the
idea of this experiment

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
was to test the Wigner's
friend hypothesis, which is--

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
this gets into the idea that
you've got the observer,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and they are sort
of dictating what

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:84%
you record, what the truth is of
a certain experimental result.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.270 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if
there was an observer

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.800 align:middle line:90%
of the first observer?

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So you're starting to
get stacked observation.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
was human observers?

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: No.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind
of observation?

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.957 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, this
particular experiment

00:19:49.957 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:84%
was conducted at the
University of Vienna, Austria,

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:90%
and Edinburgh, Scotland.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And so what they were
observing was, what

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.607 align:middle line:90%
do these two devices record?

00:20:00.607 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the humans
come along and see

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.780 align:middle line:90%
what the devices recorded.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So there are humans
involved, but the two devices

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:84%
are tracking these
six entangled photons.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
did they find?

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:90%
What was the end result?

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.253 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: This is where
it gets interesting.

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
What they found
was the two devices

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:84%
absolutely had different
results at the same place

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:90%
and same time.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the takeaway
is maybe there

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing as
an objective reality.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So going back to
that collectively

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
agreed upon realities,
that collective rendering

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:84%
of reality, using the
notion of this cup/mug,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
configuration of the handle.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:90%
So that would be--

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.078 align:middle line:84%
that's been for thousands and
thousands of years in history

00:20:41.078 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:84%
we've picked up a vessel like
this, filled it with something,

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:90%
and we've drunk from it.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And we all call it whatever
in our native language, a mug

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:90%
or a cup.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:90%
So that is agreed upon.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:50.040 align:middle line:90%
That's agreed upon.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't think too many
people would argue that.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But through thousands of years
of experience and observation.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So here in this room, I
think everyone in here

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:84%
can agree this is
a cup or a mug.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's about as
far as it sounds

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
like we're going to get anymore
with objective reality, right?

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So now what happens in this
increasingly more chaotic field

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
where we have expanding entropy,
i.e. potentials and complexity?

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.760 align:middle line:84%
How does anyone get
their bearings again?

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: This is
where I recommend

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:84%
asking the questions you
do want the answers to

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and getting above the
drama of just coming

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
from that place of anxiety
or fear or anger or sadness.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.850 align:middle line:84%
These very strong emotions
can pull us off course.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So what we need
to be looking for

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:84%
is asking questions
from a grateful place

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.430 align:middle line:84%
or a respectful place or a
kind or compassionate place.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.097 align:middle line:84%
Really asking questions
like, how good can it get?

00:21:53.097 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I love it.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.055 align:middle line:90%
That's your question.

00:21:55.055 --> 00:21:56.212 align:middle line:90%
I love that question.

00:21:56.212 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's a good
question in any circumstance.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
what we need to be

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:84%
doing when we notice that
the person standing next

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:84%
to us or whatever the situation
seems to be for each of us

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:90%
looks like a difficult one.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.262 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's true, because
you're very optimistic.

00:22:11.262 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's your favorite
question in life

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:90%
is, how good can it get?

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Which I love.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.245 align:middle line:84%
I just fell in
love with you when

00:22:16.245 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I heard that that was your
favorite question years ago.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:84%
The person right next
to you might be saying,

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:90%
how bad can it get?

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we are--
now we understand.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Everyone sort of-- we
create our own reality.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I think you've just given some
of the mechanics for that.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:90%
We are creating our own reality.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Absolutely.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about how good

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
it can get, because
it does erase and blur

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.850 align:middle line:90%
timelines and everything else.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Time can run forward, backward.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It can run in an infinite
loop, and anything's possible.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.553 align:middle line:90%
Miracles happen all the time.

00:22:43.553 --> 00:22:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: All the time, yes.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially to people
like you, and sometimes to me

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about what happened

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.760 align:middle line:84%
when you were in a particularly
high vibrational state,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.790 align:middle line:84%
in just an engrossing,
lovely conversation.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Last time you were
here in Boulder,

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:84%
you were at the wonderful
Dushanbe Teahouse here.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.685 align:middle line:90%
Now everyone had left.

00:23:01.685 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The waiters let you stay,
probably because they were just

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:90%
digging your energy.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what happened,
about how good it can get,

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:84%
reflections of creation
on the positive side.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:90%
This is a beautiful experience.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:10%
I was there with a dear
friend, Nicole DeMario.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:10%
And she's the author
of "Book of Nicole."

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:90%
But we were talking about--

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:84%
this was January--
mid-January 2020.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:84%
It's very important to
have the time frame.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just before
COVID was COVID.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.900 align:middle line:84%
It was being identified
kind of, but not yet.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It wasn't
really on our radar.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:90%
We were not aware of it.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So we had just been
talking about the ideas

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.070 align:middle line:84%
for future conferences,
talks, presentations.

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But bigger than that,
what we were really

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:84%
hoping for for the
world, and really

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:90%
asking these good questions.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And we were just ramping
each other up kind

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.477 align:middle line:84%
of like, let's
dream about how good

00:23:51.477 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:90%
it can get for the whole planet.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
We were just going
higher and higher,

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and the vibe was off
the charts to the point

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:84%
that the wait staff
said, just stay there.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:00.837 align:middle line:90%
Just keep talking.

00:24:00.837 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking and talking.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.940 align:middle line:90%
And at some point I thought, OK.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:84%
We should let them go home
and we should pack this up.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So I stood up so I could
get a picture with Nicole.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I stood up,
just in front of me,

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.800 align:middle line:84%
sort of in the middle
of-- in midair,

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I saw a rose appear
and land at my feet.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was a freshly cut tea
rose with beautiful pink color.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And I looked around.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Are there any of these
other roses on tables?

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Is this something
that they do here?

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:33.160 align:middle line:84%
No, there were no other roses on
tables, and I didn't bring it.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Nicole didn't bring it.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:90%
It just showed up.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed like
it was definitely

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:84%
a marker or an honoring,
or maybe an answer back

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:84%
from the cosmos of, yes,
this is a wonderful thing

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:84%
to be intending for all of
humanity, to be looking at,

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:84%
how kind can we
be to one another?

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:84%
How good can we
be to one another?

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:84%
How can we really respect one
another despite differences?

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly what we were
looking at, talking about,

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:90%
and then a rose appears.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the story continues,
because I tried to, of course,

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:90%
bring this rose home safely.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.950 align:middle line:90%
It meant a lot to me.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is it
vanished between the--

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:90%
I got it back to the hotel room.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:90%
I took pictures of it.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But then after that, somewhere
between getting it to the--

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I had a safe container to
bring it in and everything.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.330 align:middle line:90%
I had it all set up.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.313 align:middle line:84%
But it vanished en
route somewhere.

00:25:26.313 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it made it
to the Denver Airport even.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.542 align:middle line:84%
I looked for it and I
thought, well, maybe I

00:25:30.542 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
didn't remember where I
put it in the suitcase,

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.880 align:middle line:90%
but it was nowhere.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And it vanished
for a few months.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:90%
But it did show up again.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of those
disappearing, reappearing--

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.165 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
that in other shows.

00:25:42.165 --> 00:25:43.610 align:middle line:90%
We've both had that experience.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So it showed up in
the bottom of a heavily used bag

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:84%
that I was using constantly
between that trip

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.520 align:middle line:90%
and just in daily life.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and you
empty it all the time.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.983 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: And I always empty it.

00:25:52.983 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I throw tons
of heavy things on top.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Wallet, camera, iPad.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what?

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Just water bottles.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:90%
So it would have crushed it.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So one day I just opened the
purse to put something in it,

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and at the bottom was
the perfect exact same--

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wasn't even crushed.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:08.787 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Not crushed.

00:26:08.787 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Perfect condition, dried, as
if it had been dried perfectly

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.180 align:middle line:90%
for a few months.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's no way it
could have been sitting

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of that purse.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what did
you glean from that message?

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That was just-- and
this was several months later.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Now we're in the lockdown.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.993 align:middle line:84%
And it was a reminder of
the same message again.

00:26:27.993 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Like, everything's
going to be OK.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is a rose, which
has deep symbolic meaning.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
If you look it up
in a dream book

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.820 align:middle line:84%
or if you think about
the fragrant associated

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:84%
with certain angels, and
so forth, obviously it's

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.010 align:middle line:90%
an indicator of love.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:90%
And just don't lose hope.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Even if it seems really
difficult right now

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
that everything can
come back together.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, obviously, we
can keep this dream alive.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was really,
don't lose the dream.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You talk
about parallel timelines

00:26:58.945 --> 00:27:01.568 align:middle line:84%
and realities, and
there are so many places

00:27:01.568 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:90%
we can go in this conversation.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.840 align:middle line:84%
But since we're
here, I've heard you

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.330 align:middle line:90%
say that COVID was a timeline.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:90%
It was a timeline.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.232 align:middle line:90%
Was there another one?

00:27:13.232 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I think
there are lots of them.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.268 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, we have
collectively agreed upon--

00:27:18.268 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, it appears most
people have heard of it

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
or had some interface with
it one way or another.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So we somehow agreed
upon this timeline.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So what have you
learned from this?

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.450 align:middle line:84%
We have to say since
our parallel timelines

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.490 align:middle line:84%
that we have all
collectively agreed

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.740 align:middle line:84%
to be in this timeline
with this happening.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we look at,
how good can it get,

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:84%
when we look at, what can come
from this in a good way that

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.743 align:middle line:84%
can be helpful for all of us,
those are the right questions,

00:27:44.743 --> 00:27:46.660 align:middle line:84%
because then we're getting
answers we actually

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.280 align:middle line:90%
want the answers to.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
gets interesting.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:84%
There are other
timelines possible.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the things that
humanity needed to learn

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.760 align:middle line:84%
would have been a lot rougher
road with those other paths,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
would tend to expect.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.448 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or maybe this
gave us an expedited path

00:28:02.448 --> 00:28:03.490 align:middle line:90%
to learning those things.

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Absolutely.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.020 align:middle line:90%
At the right time.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.187 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At the right time.

00:28:06.187 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at it and I
look at the whole COVID thing,

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:84%
one thing that comes
up is it's taught us

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:19.720 align:middle line:84%
whatever we had created
prior to COVID that

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:84%
became known in medical
circles and language

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.218 align:middle line:84%
as underlying conditions
or comorbidity factors,

00:28:28.218 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
these things started coming to
the surface almost right away.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.660 align:middle line:84%
But only the extreme ones
like diabetes or something.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is everyone, unless
you're a little baby or a kid,

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:84%
most people have
something that's

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.140 align:middle line:84%
been created within their
being that's out of balance.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And what this did
is it pushed it.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.060 align:middle line:90%
It pushed it forward.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you had brewing
got pushed to the forefront

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:90%
like the stress of COVID.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about
the beauty of that.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, see, I got personally
involved with that.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you did.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And obviously
that's a good thing,

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.530 align:middle line:84%
because then I was
able to go through it,

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:07.190 align:middle line:84%
come out the other side,
recovered with vast wisdom,

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:09.580 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, and depth
of experience of it,

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:13.210 align:middle line:84%
which showed me
personally that--

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:84%
because I do keep
asking those questions.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I do live this path of,
how good can it get?

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I started
seeing was the gift

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.530 align:middle line:90%
in the long-haul COVID.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.510 align:middle line:84%
COVID was rough on me
too, but the long-haul

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
COVID, I'd say that
was much harder for me

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.910 align:middle line:84%
than for a lot of
people, because there

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:84%
are hundreds of
symptoms basically,

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.990 align:middle line:84%
to the point that
when anybody goes

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.150 align:middle line:84%
to see their doctor
or caregiver,

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:90%
the doctor's overwhelmed.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.600 align:middle line:90%
They can't handle 200 symptoms.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:90%
It's too much.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But when I was looking at,
what are the gifts here,

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.000 align:middle line:90%
I saw, well, what am I seeing?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.900 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm noticing I'm about 30 years
older suddenly, like overnight.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.370 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm suddenly in my golden
years, which are not so golden.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, everything's
falling apart.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a preview
of-- apparently

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.065 align:middle line:90%
I would get arthritis.

00:29:59.065 --> 00:30:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I might get tremors,
Parkinson's, brain fog,

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.960 align:middle line:84%
All these things we tend to
associate with aging, right?

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, but these are--

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
when these things
express in age,

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:84%
they've already been manifesting
on subtle energy levels

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.800 align:middle line:84%
for a long time
prior based on what

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.810 align:middle line:84%
we've been exposed to,
our thought, our beliefs,

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.760 align:middle line:90%
our past history and all that.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.113 align:middle line:84%
So it almost gave you a
coming attraction time.

00:30:25.113 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, it
was better than that.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I got the answers
at the end of the book.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.770 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like--

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.205 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of like, wow.

00:30:31.205 --> 00:30:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Because when I ask,
what are the gifts,

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.050 align:middle line:84%
then I started seeing
there are gifts,

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:84%
because there are such
things as antioxidants that

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:84%
can help bring healing
and bring restoration

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to our natural system so that
we can back off everything

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I just talked about,
which I was experiencing

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.870 align:middle line:84%
as well as the multitudes
of other symptoms.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And we can do this with
a very targeted approach.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.150 align:middle line:84%
For each of us, we all have
different physiologies.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.340 align:middle line:84%
We all have different
energetic makeups.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.400 align:middle line:84%
But we can start learning
from our own unique signs

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and groupings of
symptoms and find exactly

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:84%
a targeted, natural
way out of it.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.030 align:middle line:90%
No, that's really interesting.

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:90%
And I agree.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the same thing
I noticed among people,

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.720 align:middle line:84%
is that something that
may not have expressed

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.440 align:middle line:84%
itself was expressing itself
early, or way sooner than one

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.090 align:middle line:90%
would have expected.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, it also,
like you said, it guided you.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.570 align:middle line:84%
If arthritis is in my future,
if that's brewing energetically,

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I can get a jump
on that right now.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to me the greatest
gift was to say, you know what?

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I think the people even at
the highest levels have said,

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.450 align:middle line:84%
everybody's going to be
exposed to this by the time

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:40.980 align:middle line:90%
it's-- whenever it passes.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And if not, you've had the
spike protein introduced

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:84%
through vaccines, so everybody's
got this spike protein in them

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.190 align:middle line:90%
This is part of humanity.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And so in the initial
stage of the stress

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.430 align:middle line:84%
of this new thing
in us, we learned

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:58.810 align:middle line:90%
that the greatest gift is now--

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:01.730 align:middle line:84%
we're obliged to
listen to ourselves,

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.410 align:middle line:84%
our bodies, our emotions,
and treat ourselves kindly.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is what's
required to stay healthy now.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, absolutely.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of
the healing regimen

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:84%
that I followed was 90 days
of minimum stress, exertion,

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and heat, because it releases
those spike proteins you're

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.680 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So long story short,
that is necessary.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's so hard for us.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.335 align:middle line:84%
We tend to live a
very stressful life.

00:32:27.335 --> 00:32:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, look.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:29.293 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is wonderful.

00:32:29.293 --> 00:32:31.052 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:31.052 --> 00:32:32.260 align:middle line:90%
You and I are both optimists.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.580 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful in
a way, because it

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.997 align:middle line:84%
got to happen to the whole
planet at one time pretty much,

00:32:35.997 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
except for some isolated
people here and there.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.580 align:middle line:90%
It got to happen to everyone.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And usually those
isolated people

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.270 align:middle line:84%
are Indigenous people who
aren't living the rat race

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.760 align:middle line:84%
life the rest of the people,
the rest of us on the planet

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.390 align:middle line:90%
are living.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.973 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's the
lesson that didn't

00:32:47.973 --> 00:32:50.720 align:middle line:84%
need to be learned in some
of those more remote areas,

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and so they were
untouched by it.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But I just think about
the beauty of what

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:90%
happened when everyone--

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
A, we all talk about
the great pause.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:59.993 align:middle line:84%
Everyone had a few
months off and everything

00:32:59.993 --> 00:33:00.910 align:middle line:90%
was quiet for a while.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Earth got to recover herself
and take a breath without us

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:90%
trammeling all over the place.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.250 align:middle line:84%
But much deeper than that,
we got to look at ourselves

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and who we are and
what we're doing.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And now if we try to do it,
we start getting exhausted

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:14.810 align:middle line:90%
or maybe we feel sick again.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe
another little thing

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:19.300 align:middle line:84%
starts revealing
itself in our health

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.160 align:middle line:90%
that we were not happy to see.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And this is where we
can play with that uncertainty

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.668 align:middle line:84%
principle, play with
the quantum physics,

00:33:24.668 --> 00:33:27.640 align:middle line:84%
play with the entanglement,
recognize relationships matter,

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:90%
the questions matter.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And we can guide ourselves
in a positive way out of it.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:35.102 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And that's
not to minimize what's

00:33:35.102 --> 00:33:36.430 align:middle line:90%
happened to so many people.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.620 align:middle line:84%
It's been a tough time, and a
lot of people have passed on.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:90%
And I had it too.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And while I didn't have
any long-hauler syndrome,

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.360 align:middle line:90%
I will say this.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.990 align:middle line:84%
If I get emotionally
stressed out and upset,

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.360 align:middle line:84%
one of the features
that I had in my body,

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.210 align:middle line:84%
which was that spike
protein that inflames you

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:84%
where you start getting
this burning under the skin

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and tingling, that
starts up again.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So the spike
protein's still there.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:04.113 align:middle line:84%
So I know I'm over the
edge on emotions and stress

00:34:04.113 --> 00:34:05.530 align:middle line:84%
when I start feeling
the tingling.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:07.010 align:middle line:90%
It's like, there it is.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Back off.

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:09.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to go
back to that again.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a wonderful
reminder, really.

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:84%
So that's that, and
thank you for sharing

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:90%
your own experience.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.939 align:middle line:10%
And I think we're not
cheerleaders for COVID

00:34:19.939 --> 00:34:20.739 align:middle line:10%
by any means.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.364 align:middle line:84%
We're just looking
at the silver lining

00:34:22.364 --> 00:34:23.679 align:middle line:90%
and the beauty that can come.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.659 align:middle line:84%
And it couldn't have
come to humanity

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:28.570 align:middle line:84%
to slow down, pay attention,
take care of yourselves, rest,

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.070 align:middle line:84%
couldn't have come
in any other way.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:31.330 align:middle line:84%
We weren't going to
do it voluntarily.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I hope people can
be kind to one another and not

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.478 align:middle line:90%
withhold medical care or--

00:34:36.478 --> 00:34:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
whole other thing.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.159 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.710 align:middle line:84%
That's where the camps
of truth have come in.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:45.310 align:middle line:84%
It's become so mean-spirited,
really so cruel,

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.250 align:middle line:84%
when this is the time we should
be offering the most grace

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:49.850 align:middle line:90%
and compassion to each other.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.018 align:middle line:84%
That part of the lesson,
we haven't learned.

00:34:52.018 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:84%
We're learning--
maybe we're starting

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.272 align:middle line:84%
to learn about our
bodies, but we're not

00:34:55.272 --> 00:34:56.980 align:middle line:84%
starting to learn
about our interactions.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That requires
emotional intelligence.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Emotional
intelligence.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And we hear so
many people talking about

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.920 align:middle line:84%
trust the science and
be smart, but what

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.820 align:middle line:90%
about the wisdom of the heart?

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That matters so much.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And timelines, traveling into
the future beyond all of this,

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.900 align:middle line:90%
have you looked into the future?

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Have you had any
experiences of kind

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:84%
of traveling into what
appears to be the future?

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've had a
feeling of living

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.120 align:middle line:84%
a past life in the future,
so that's a big one.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:28.920 align:middle line:90%
But that's huge.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.730 align:middle line:90%
That's like, whoo!

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.897 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I can't
unpack that in five minutes,

00:35:31.897 --> 00:35:33.300 align:middle line:90%
but you could give it a try.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.950 align:middle line:90%
But what is your--

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:38.730 align:middle line:84%
what sense from this thing we
call past, present, and future

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and a past life in the
future, so to speak,

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:46.280 align:middle line:84%
what do you see about how this
turns out, where we're headed?

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And again, these are
all potential timelines.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, hopefully
we can return to a sense

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:84%
that Indigenous people have long
had, of respecting the Earth,

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.400 align:middle line:84%
respecting one another
that is so important.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And I feel so strongly
about it that I've

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:84%
coined a new term, revhumanism,
as a different choice

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.560 align:middle line:84%
to transhumanism, because
with so many of the technology

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:84%
proponents-- and there's
nothing wrong with technology

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:12.660 align:middle line:90%
implicitly.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:84%
But if we put all of our
faith into AI and the future

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.608 align:middle line:84%
being mechanized
and technological--

00:36:18.608 --> 00:36:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The heart's
missing it from the future.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The heart's missing.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.352 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your version of what

00:36:24.352 --> 00:36:26.060 align:middle line:84%
happens on the path
you're talking about,

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.280 align:middle line:84%
because you talk about
the word ascension,

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:90%
but not in the new age sense.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: No.

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.312 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about what real ascension

00:36:32.312 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:90%
looks like for you.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, real ascension has to
do with getting into a higher

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:84%
level of wisdom that's
available to all of us,

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.780 align:middle line:84%
when we start asking
these questions

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that our
consciousness is really

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:47.250 align:middle line:90%
many levels of consciousness.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And this draws from the ideas
from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz,

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.770 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the
inventors of calculus.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And he had the idea that
if you have a first order

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.930 align:middle line:84%
perception of
touching something,

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.630 align:middle line:84%
a sensation of some sort,
and then you, the person

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.480 align:middle line:84%
that you think you really
are, you're observing that.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there can
be levels above that.

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the
idea of ascension

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:13.400 align:middle line:84%
comes in, recognizing that
we have higher levels of self

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.100 align:middle line:84%
that we might get
through feeling

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.840 align:middle line:84%
connected to
angels, for example,

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.560 align:middle line:90%
channeling, that kind of thing.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.300 align:middle line:90%
And we all have access to it.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:84%
We can open ourselves
up to receiving higher

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.740 align:middle line:90%
levels of awareness of self.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.147 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big idea.

00:37:29.147 --> 00:37:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a big idea.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But also what allows us to
open into the new, including

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:38.960 align:middle line:84%
the transcendent, is often
trauma, being pulled up

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.780 align:middle line:90%
from our moorings.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
certainly happening right now.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It is.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
leaving more people

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.950 align:middle line:84%
perhaps unmoored, but also
open to new understanding,

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:49.910 align:middle line:90%
new influence.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully that's the case.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And the big jump, the
ascension leap, if you will,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.690 align:middle line:84%
is to move out of that
trauma body of all that--

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.840 align:middle line:84%
we were talking earlier
about the grief, the sadness,

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.910 align:middle line:84%
the anxiety, the
fear, and the anger.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:08.330 align:middle line:84%
These are points on
a drama triangle.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three
main roles that people

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:12.840 align:middle line:84%
play without knowing
they're doing it.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the key is to rise
above those knee-jerk reactions

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:84%
we often have so that we can
start feeling that higher level

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:23.405 align:middle line:90%
self that we can get.

00:38:23.405 --> 00:38:26.690 align:middle line:84%
If you're able to document what
happened to me this last 24

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:30.020 align:middle line:84%
hours and actually find three
things you're grateful for--

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's huge.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:84%
That gets more toward
the Cynthia way of living

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.240 align:middle line:84%
is how good-- that gets
toward, how good can it get?

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is so
overlooked because we're tired.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.800 align:middle line:90%
We're exhausted.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.047 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I think
you're absolutely right.

00:38:45.047 --> 00:38:46.850 align:middle line:84%
If there's one thing
we could do before we

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:90%
go to sleep at night--

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:52.040 align:middle line:84%
you said name three things that
we're grateful or thankful for.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's huge.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:53.660 align:middle line:90%
That's a takeaway.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.667 align:middle line:84%
That's a Post-it
note on the forehead,

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:57.500 align:middle line:84%
because that's going
to lead to this greater

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.112 align:middle line:84%
understanding and awareness
that you're talking about.

00:39:00.112 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And when
you tie that into what

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.275 align:middle line:84%
you had something to do with,
then you feel like, wow.

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:05.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm involved in this.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:08.328 align:middle line:84%
And you start gradually
crawling out of that pit

00:39:08.328 --> 00:39:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that you might have felt
like you've fallen into.

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.250 align:middle line:90%
And you say this is really--

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:18.180 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, it's about rising
above our ego consciousness.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It is.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.080 align:middle line:84%
The death that happens--
because often when people

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.030 align:middle line:84%
say ascending, they
think, well, you died.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the
only death really

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.790 align:middle line:84%
is the ego of death, that
smaller version of ourselves

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that's just interested
in, I need to get mine.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.200 align:middle line:90%
If I get mine, then I'm good.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Instead of really
recognizing that our life is

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:90%
much more in service to others.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what brings
true happiness.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So if we can be
entangled-- we're

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.780 align:middle line:84%
in this field of
entanglement, right?

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.150 align:middle line:84%
You, Dean Radin, and many
people talk about this field

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:48.020 align:middle line:90%
of entanglement.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:51.380 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to choose-- if
we're going to be entangled,

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:55.850 align:middle line:84%
if we can direct our intention
toward being entangled,

00:39:55.850 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:84%
as you say, in love, in
loving presence, in grace,

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.070 align:middle line:84%
in compassion, and choose that
resonance of entanglement,

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that's going to bring a
certain quality of potential

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:09.060 align:middle line:90%
to our lives to create from.

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:09.893 align:middle line:90%
Becomes our toolbox.

00:40:09.893 --> 00:40:10.693 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:40:10.693 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:90%
And it cuts through the noise.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It cuts through-- and you
can feel it happening.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.820 align:middle line:84%
When you're focusing on
the people that you love

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and on what you care about
most, then those kind

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.920 align:middle line:84%
of chaotic concerns and
anxieties don't seem real.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.020 align:middle line:90%
And they're not.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, to someone they are.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:31.905 align:middle line:84%
People that are locking that
in as their reality, that

00:40:31.905 --> 00:40:32.780 align:middle line:90%
can be their reality.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.322 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
we've all been there.

00:40:34.322 --> 00:40:36.233 align:middle line:84%
Gotten super stressed
out like, I can't

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:37.400 align:middle line:90%
believe they're saying this.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But we've all gotten wrapped
around the axle on this stuff.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But ideally, we can
ascend out of the chaos,

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.690 align:middle line:84%
the emotional
drama, and get back

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to that sense of low-entropy
love in our hearts

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:84%
where it's not
chaotic, where we just

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:56.840 align:middle line:84%
have that feeling of
pure love and bliss,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.940 align:middle line:90%
that unconditional love feeling.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's real.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:00.888 align:middle line:90%
It's quite real.

00:41:00.888 --> 00:41:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
where roses manifest from.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's where
we can manifest our--

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.580 align:middle line:90%
manifest our reality from.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Or we can be distraught
and destroyed

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:15.230 align:middle line:84%
by what appears to
be the lack of truth

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and the chaos ensuing and
people at each other's throats

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and go into despair, anger,
or sadness over this.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's our toolbox.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.072 align:middle line:84%
That's what we get
to create from.

00:41:25.072 --> 00:41:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And that's how you
can tell which path you're on.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:28.905 align:middle line:84%
That's a great
way to look at it.

00:41:28.905 --> 00:41:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One final thing I
wanted to ask you before we go.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.507 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the signs of
the spiritual awakening,

00:41:34.507 --> 00:41:35.840 align:middle line:90%
because there are a lot of them.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of fast,
but everyone watching

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.553 align:middle line:84%
is probably tapping into
one or more of these things.

00:41:41.553 --> 00:41:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, there's
so many of them.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's get in
order of priority,

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.930 align:middle line:84%
some of the most common
ones that you're noticing.

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.938 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people
are noticing things

00:41:49.938 --> 00:41:50.930 align:middle line:90%
like repeating numbers.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.030 align:middle line:84%
You might look at your
clock, and it seems

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:54.260 align:middle line:90%
like I'm always seeing 1:11.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
see that a lot too.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.117 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: You know,
2:22 and 3:33.

00:41:57.117 --> 00:41:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 4:44, my birth time.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: [LAUGHS]
Oh, I love it.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So we
see these numbers.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Or it might be a
significant number,

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:07.730 align:middle line:84%
like someone might see their
birth number or their birthday

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:90%
or that of a loved one.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:13.010 align:middle line:84%
But the repeating numbers
are very strongly meaningful,

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:16.070 align:middle line:84%
because they can activate
within us a sense that there's

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.582 align:middle line:90%
something bigger than just me.

00:42:17.582 --> 00:42:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Like, how is it
that every time I'm

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.600 align:middle line:84%
looking at a clock,
that's the time?

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Who could be orchestrating this?

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:23.753 align:middle line:90%
This is kind of mind-blowing.

00:42:23.753 --> 00:42:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's like
a tap, getting your--

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting your attention.

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Absolutely.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And then lots of
people with ascension syndromes

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.735 align:middle line:84%
are feeling things like
seeing flashes of light.

00:42:33.735 --> 00:42:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everywhere.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.532 align:middle line:84%
So this is happening
on a big scale.

00:42:37.532 --> 00:42:39.740 align:middle line:84%
It used to be just a few
people this would happen to.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Now it's much more widespread.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And then seeing things like
reality shifts, Mandela

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.370 align:middle line:84%
effects, that's
increasing as well.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
witnessing, am I

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.860 align:middle line:90%
looking at a parallel universe?

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Senses of
lost time or no time.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: No time.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Synchronicity's
increasing.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Synchronicity's
a big one.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.960 align:middle line:90%
So I love this.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.748 align:middle line:90%
What we see can be changed.

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:06.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
going to go out on.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.430 align:middle line:84%
If you can see it,
you can work with it.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:09.230 align:middle line:90%
You can change it.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.260 align:middle line:84%
You can apply these principles
that make up our toolboxes,

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.503 align:middle line:90%
so let's finish on that.

00:43:14.503 --> 00:43:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, I like to
do it kind of like improv.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can say, OK, I accept
this from a neutral place.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.080 align:middle line:90%
So we're not getting dramatic.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.030 align:middle line:84%
We're just recognizing, OK,
so I've got long-haul COVID.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.510 align:middle line:90%
So you're in a neutral place.

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But you want to be
positively looking forward.

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.490 align:middle line:84%
You want to be looking, like,
what can I learn from this?

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:33.680 align:middle line:90%
What's the gift?

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Where can this go?

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So then when we take
the idea that what

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.580 align:middle line:84%
you see around you looks
like it's fixed, it's solid,

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:84%
it's in place, it's not going to
change, don't stay stuck there.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.592 align:middle line:90%
Recognize things do change.

00:43:47.592 --> 00:43:49.550 align:middle line:10%
Basically, some people
that believe in miracles

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:52.550 align:middle line:10%
would say, a miracle can happen
in a moment, in a second.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.360 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.550 align:middle line:10%
But we can also recognize
even if you don't believe

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.740 align:middle line:10%
in miracles, we
now know that you

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:01.310 align:middle line:10%
can have two observers at
the same place and same time

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:02.730 align:middle line:10%
seeing two different things.

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:05.810 align:middle line:84%
So your frame of mind,
where you're coming from,

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.460 align:middle line:84%
the questions
you're asking, what

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.380 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking,
how you're feeling

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:13.065 align:middle line:84%
will absolutely
affect the outcome.

00:44:13.065 --> 00:44:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.590 align:middle line:90%
So I love what you had to say.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Just quickly re-encapsulating,
stay out of the drama

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.250 align:middle line:84%
if you can, if you can avoid
the density of the drama which

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.240 align:middle line:84%
takes you into a
lower resonance field.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have
these three-- if you

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.330 align:middle line:84%
can, before you go
to sleep at night,

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.280 align:middle line:84%
find at least
three things you're

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.440 align:middle line:84%
grateful for that you were
personally even engaged

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.540 align:middle line:84%
with during that day,
which starts laying

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:38.570 align:middle line:84%
the foundation for that good
toolbox of love and resonance

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude, grace,
and all of that, right?

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And understand that we're
in a world that is--

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.640 align:middle line:84%
well, reality shifts
is what you do, right?

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.890 align:middle line:90%
It's called reality shifts.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:51.510 align:middle line:90%
We're in a very fluid reality.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're going to
have to choose what's true,

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:55.490 align:middle line:90%
we'd better make it good.

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Ask the questions you
want the answers to.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.480 align:middle line:90%
And how good can it get?

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.098 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:02.098 --> 00:45:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once again,
Cynthia, thank you so much.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.640 align:middle line:84%
You're such a
brainiac, and I really

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.060 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the fact that
you can take something

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:12.380 align:middle line:84%
as complex as quantum science
and bring it into a language

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.600 align:middle line:84%
that we can understand
and have takeaways from.

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Oh, thank you.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for what you do too.

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Cynthia
puts out regular posts

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.290 align:middle line:84%
with her loving
and incisive view

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:24.080 align:middle line:84%
on how we can live into our
highest potential of life,

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.320 align:middle line:84%
into joy and grace and
divine uncertainty.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.480 align:middle line:84%
