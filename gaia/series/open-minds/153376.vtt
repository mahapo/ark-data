00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: It's
not uncommon for a person

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:84%
to have their breakthrough
as a result of illness.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:10%
In the case of Connie
Kaplan, her illness

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:10%
kept her in a state of almost
constant sleep for weeks.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
During that time, a very
refined and lovely system

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.150 align:middle line:84%
of understanding
our human nature

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.914 align:middle line:90%
was downloaded into her mind.

00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Being a mainstream
[INAUDIBLE,] however,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.810 align:middle line:84%
she did not want to share this
for fear of being ridiculed.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Connie Kaplan is with us today
to share her system called

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:90%
The Invisible Garment.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And this is our second chat.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take it a
little deeper from where

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:90%
we were last time.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:84%
But I still think we need to
give the back story for people

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:84%
who did not-- because
it's a new audience.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:90%
It's been what, three years?

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNIE KAPLAN: Mm-hmm.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.790 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.956 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: About three years.

00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Give the back story as
to what happened to you.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: All right.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
You want to hear
the whole story?

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, go for it.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.483 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: All right.

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:10%
The first episode of this story
was when, as you mentioned,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:10%
I was ill.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.860 align:middle line:10%
And it was several
years, actually.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:10%
It was two years where I did
an enormous amount of sleeping.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was
downloaded with a body

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:90%
of information about dreaming.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Several years later,
I had another sort

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
of mystical experience,
and this one

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:90%
was at my father's deathbed.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I was alone with
him when he died,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and I heard the
door open behind me.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:90%
I was sitting at his bed.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It was predawn.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't imagine
who was coming in.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It must have been a nurse
to check his vitals.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:90%
It was 5:30 in the morning.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
energy in the room

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:90%
that was just really profound.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
In retrospect, I see
that it was love.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:90%
I stopped.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:90%
I got up.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.279 align:middle line:90%
I turned around.

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And there were these two angels
sitting there in the room.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was a problem
for me, because I

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:90%
didn't believe in angels.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.944 align:middle line:84%
So often, we're faced
with this choice

00:02:20.944 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
between going with
what we believe

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and going with what
we're experiencing.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And in that particular moment, I
chose to go with my experience.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And I got a little
snide and said,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.755 align:middle line:90%
so why'd you use the door?

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why didn't you
just walk through the wall

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.129 align:middle line:90%
if you're such a smarty pants?

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Angels
don't need doors.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
said, we're here

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
to open the portals,
all the portals.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of went,
whoa, this is big.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
This is more than just
my father's death.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:84%
They said, we have
some information

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:90%
that we need you to write down.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.144 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't really that
happy about that idea.

00:02:56.144 --> 00:02:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
important to stress here,

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
you were very mainstream
in your thinking.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.650 align:middle line:84%
You were not over into
the metaphysical realms

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:90%
of experimentation at this time.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: True.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I was probably still a
little to the left of center,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.520 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't--

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not this far.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I wasn't a
part of the new age.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't really that.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
thought they wanted.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.376 align:middle line:84%
I thought they
wanted me to become

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
one of those channels
who sat on the stage

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:90%
and had a strange voice.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, no, I could
recommend some people to you,

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:90%
but I'm--

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of said,
yeah, you don't negotiate

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:90%
with the angel of death.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.426 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And at that
particular moment,

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
my consciousness was blasted
into a dimension of sound

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:90%
and color and geometric shape.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:90%
That's all that was there.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.477 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that also, that was
the dimension of all answers,

00:03:53.477 --> 00:03:55.060 align:middle line:84%
of all possibilities,
and all answers.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The building
blocks reality.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that if
I had a question,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:84%
it would be answered
immediately.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't think of any
questions to ask in the place

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:90%
where all the answers are.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Because the answers
were already there.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So I came back from that, and
I said, OK, what do you want?

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And they said, most
people are mistaken

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:90%
about what a human life is.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Most people think that you're
either here to learn lessons

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
or you're here to do
something or you're here

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:90%
to create or burn karma.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:90%
It's none of that.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:84%
You're here to deliver a
gift from the level of soul

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:90%
into the level of form.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore,
you are the gift.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So your only job
in this lifetime

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:90%
is to be who you are by nature.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And we need to remind
people of who they are

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:90%
and how to be that.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you find this
message came as a relief,

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:90%
or was it perplexing?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: It was a
little perplexing.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
we're not in school?

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.224 align:middle line:90%
Everybody says we're in school.

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Aren't
we here to learn?

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah, everybody
says the soul needs to learn.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:84%
The soul doesn't need to
learn anything, or not

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.550 align:middle line:90%
from you, anyway.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: They redefined soul
for me, which was interesting.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.196 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
that, because I was going

00:05:26.196 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:90%
to bring it up later anyway.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: They said
the soul is one unified

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:90%
field of consciousness.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Human soul is like one
field of consciousness

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:84%
out of which we each
individually emanate.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not your soul and my
soul and she's an old soul

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:90%
and he's a good soul.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.520 align:middle line:84%
We are all emanating from one
unified field of consciousness.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And the specific and unique
way that each of us emanates

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
is the gift from
the soul into form.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So they, over the course of
the next three or four months,

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I woke up almost every
night and did some writing.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.377 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, this body of
information had formed itself.

00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they give
it to you piecemeal?

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Mm-hmm.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sort of
one aspect at a time?

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, and not
necessarily this and therefore

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:84%
It was like, this, and
then the other night,

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:90%
I would write this.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And then another
night, I'd write this.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, it finally
came together.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
It was like one big
body of information.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.324 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't any kind of fear.

00:06:30.324 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
took a lot of faith

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
on your part to even
stay with that project.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I guess by the time I
started working on it,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:90%
it was so interesting to me.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:90%
It's really a fascinating thing.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it basically says,
at first breath, you agree to

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:84%
or you sign on to give
livingness to somewhere

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:84%
in the neighborhood of
12 spiritual principles

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:84%
under certain rules
and regulations.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, the
main spiritual principle,

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
that you're here to
live, is connected

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to where the sun was at
the moment of your birth.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm not an astrologer.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So I really don't know
much about astrology.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.460 align:middle line:90%
But I know to--

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.080 align:middle line:84%
I know how to decide
or how to discern

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
what the degree is of the
placement of your sun at birth

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:90%
by looking at a chart.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And then that degree corresponds
to one of the principles.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So I know what your
primary principle

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:84%
is, and so forth and
so on down the line.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So I can share with people
what their package is, what

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.990 align:middle line:90%
their spiritual package is.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
What are you here to be?

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you learn to
be that, you're done.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.060 align:middle line:90%
That's your gift.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.603 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: These
principles are divided

00:07:56.603 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:90%
into three segments of 10.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
There are 10 that we call
the Ascending Principles,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
10 that we call the
Containing Principles,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and 10 that we call the
Descending Principles.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
The Ascending Principles
are principles

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.220 align:middle line:84%
that are deeply connected
to nature and to the earth.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:84%
The Descending
Principles are principles

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:84%
that are connected to the
cosmos, to the galaxies,

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:90%
to galactic energy.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.395 align:middle line:84%
And the Containing Principles
are principles that we--

00:08:25.395 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:84%
that are connected to the
human, to the human realm.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So I often use the
metaphor of a tree,

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:84%
that the Ascending
Principles are the roots.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:84%
The Containing
Principles are the trunk,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and the Descending
Principles are

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:90%
the leaves and the branches.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's another thing that
we look at with a person.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.970 align:middle line:84%
If you have a lot of
Descending Principles

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:84%
but not so many Containing
or Ascending Principles,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
then your life is a
little more challenging,

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:84%
because you're
kind of out there.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And you are now looking
for partnerships

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:90%
to hold your kite string.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I've often said, if you don't
have a certain principle,

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.200 align:middle line:84%
you will either marry
it or give birth to it

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
or go into partnership
with it in some way.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Because that way, there's--

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that's how we look at the
balance in relationships.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Quick question here.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, have you ever
seen that there

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:84%
is some overlay with, say, a
person's astrological chart

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
in terms of whether they have
the same traits, these more

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.897 align:middle line:90%
airier, ungrounded traits?

00:09:30.897 --> 00:09:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You mean like in
terms of their-- the elements

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:90%
in their astrological chart?

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.137 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah,
I'm sure there are.

00:09:37.137 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, though, not--

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's always kind of
interesting when they overlay.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.556 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: But I'm not
as much of an astrologer

00:09:41.556 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:84%
as I should be to really
answer that question well.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'll give you a
couple of examples of each

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:90%
of these kinds of principles.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Placement, this is
the first principle.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Placement is very deeply
connected to earth energy.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of
principle that is--

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that allows you to
understand nature.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
physicists will say,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.077 align:middle line:84%
no two quanta can identify the
same place at the same time,

00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:19.410 align:middle line:90%
the same space at the same time.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:90%
It's that.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Each quanta in form
has its own location.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to locate yourself
before anything else can

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:84%
So people who have placement
in their Invisible Garment

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:84%
patterns will often be people
who use their bodies really

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.417 align:middle line:84%
Dancers, I've found,
a lot of the people

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:84%
who have come to me over
the years who are dancers

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:90%
have placement in their chart.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Athletes, people who-- now,
each of these principles

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
also has a physical,
a place that it's

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:84%
located in the physical
world, in the physical body.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much literally
your physical body

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:84%
as it is this principle plays
that role in the cosmic body.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So placement is
located in the feet.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So placement is like the
feet of the cosmic body.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But I do find it interesting
that dancers and athletes have

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:84%
placement, often,
in their chart.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
My son is an athlete,
and he has placement

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:84%
in a very important
place in his chart.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's just interesting
to me to watch how that--

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How it's expressed.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.763 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Expresses in the body.

00:11:31.763 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this would be
one of the principles in terms

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:84%
of some of the unique genius
that they're bringing through

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:90%
or opportunity.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Absolutely, yes.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Another ascending
principle is one

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.670 align:middle line:90%
called Extension This also is--

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
it's about how life
longs to extend itself.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So I always see
this as those plants

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.822 align:middle line:84%
in the garden that
have roots in the--

00:11:53.822 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The little suckers.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And they just show up
all over everywhere,

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
because they're just constantly
looking for new places

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:90%
to express.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Extension
exists in the hands.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So you'll often find people
who are pianists, people

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.070 align:middle line:84%
who are artists, cooks,
massage therapists, people who

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:84%
use their hands a
lot, you'll often

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
find that principle in their
Invisible Garment pattern.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, if this
principle were placed

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:84%
in the position of the sun,
would that mean that is one

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:90%
of their primary--

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.620 align:middle line:84%
the primary principle
the need to work with?

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.163 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: The primary principle.

00:12:31.163 --> 00:12:31.963 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:12:31.963 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I have a very good
friend who, when she was young,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.790 align:middle line:90%
she joined the military.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say Air
Force, but I'm not

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.997 align:middle line:84%
sure which branch
of the military.

00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So she was very young
when she joined.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So 25 years later, she was
only 45 or something, retired.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And she kind of sat
back and said, now,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:90%
what do I really want to be?

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.470 align:middle line:90%
What do I want to do?

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And she became a
massage therapist.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.029 align:middle line:90%
And her son is an extension.

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course, she didn't
know that then.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But many years later
when she discovered that,

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:90%
she realized what she had done.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:09.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is what--

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.910 align:middle line:84%
this is what I mean
by being over doing.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:84%
What she had done is she
had let her beingness evoke

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:90%
her doing this.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is really the key

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:84%
for every human being in every
incarnation all the time.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's the thing we
tend to miss the most.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Because culturally,
we have this idea

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:84%
that we need to figure
out what to do and do it.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's the question
that we get asked so often

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:90%
is, what do you do?

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:90%
What do I do about what?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: I hate that question.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hate
that question too.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I have no
answer for that question.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I usually deflect it.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
the sun principle.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
more of the actual principles

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But is it appropriate
to do that now,

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:84%
get into an array of the
principles and examples of how

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
they've shown themselves or
bear themselves out in the world

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.490 align:middle line:84%
before we get into some of the
other aspects, like the moon

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:90%
and so forth?

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.730 align:middle line:90%
If this is our principal one.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK let's hit it.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.940 align:middle line:90%
We have 30 principles, right?

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to talk
about all 30 of them.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I know.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.199 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Actually we talked
about a lot of them in the last

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:90%
interview, so I'm--

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And some people
will have seen them,

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:90%
and some people will have not.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So kind of hit on
new ones that you

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
didn't focus on last time,
maybe a few of the most

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:90%
important ones.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: All right, so now
in the containing department,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
the Containing Principals,
the trunk of the tree,

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:84%
one of the principals
is resistance.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And resistance as a
spiritual principle

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:84%
is not about
pushback or refusing

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:90%
to do what I want you to do.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:84%
It's about-- it's more
like being a resistor

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.407 align:middle line:90%
in an electrical circuit.

00:14:54.407 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: The energy
comes through Hoover Dam

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
in the form of
heat, and then, it

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
runs through a
series of resistors

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:84%
before it can show
up in your bathroom

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:90%
to plug your blow dryer into.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:84%
You can't plug your blow
dryer directly into it.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So people who have resistance
in their Invisible Garment

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:84%
are people who take
energy in in various

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:16.990 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's in
forms of thought.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's in
emotional form.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's in
more action forms.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:84%
They take it in, and they
transmute it and transform it

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:84%
in their bodies and send
it back out in a way

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
that it can be
used in the world.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
My favorite example of a person
whose sun was in resistance

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:90%
is Joan of Arc.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So she
listened to her angels,

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and she transformed
their energy into what

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:90%
needed to be done for them.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.104 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
a perfect example.

00:15:53.104 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: I love that.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:84%
That's beautiful OK,
give us a few more.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Attraction.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Attraction is also a
Containing Principle.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the reasons that I

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:84%
wish all books were more
like Harry Potter books,

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.860 align:middle line:90%
where they change.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I understand attraction
now almost completely

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:84%
differently than I did when
I wrote the definition down

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:90%
in the book.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I owe that partially to the
popularity of what people call

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:84%
the law of attraction,
where if you want something,

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:84%
you just think about it a
lot, and then you get it.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Attraction as a spiritual
principle is not that.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
The metaphor I like
to use for attraction

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.130 align:middle line:84%
is thinking about
a flower that stays

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:84%
in the bud for a long,
long, long, long time.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And then someday, for some
reason that nobody knows,

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:84%
the bud opens, and the
flower presents itself,

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:84%
not to attract
things that it needs,

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:84%
but to attract
things that need it.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:84%
So the flower opens, and
here come the butterflies.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And here come the bees,
and here come the hummers.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been
waiting for this gift.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way I look at
people who have attraction

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:90%
in their garment patterns.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
When they have really
opened to giving their gift,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:84%
everyone that needs them or
everything that needs them or--

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
example, my favorite
example of attraction

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:90%
is John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:84%
He was not the
favorite Kennedy child.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:84%
His older brother
was, apparently.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:84%
But when he finally
opened, he became the gift

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:90%
that the entire country needed.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.782 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I'm--

00:17:45.782 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's
interesting is

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
you say it takes a long
time for the bud to open,

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
so it's as though
the being has to go

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.480 align:middle line:84%
through their own
maturity process.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Together, the forces, so when
the band does open and reveal

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:90%
it, there's something to give.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Exactly.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.549 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's vital and full.

00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Exactly.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are some
other examples of those,

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:84%
of that particular attraction,
the principle of attraction

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:90%
that you know of?

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Some other people?

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of any other
people that would be famous.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But I do know you
know a lot of people

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:18.560 align:middle line:84%
who have come to me who
didn't know what their job was

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
in the world, what their
place was in the world,

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:84%
until they were 45,
50, 55 years old.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And you found that the
sun was in that principle?

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know this,
because I don't know his name.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know his
astrological chart.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But I'm thinking
about the guy you

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.600 align:middle line:84%
know on the commercial
who plays the most

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:90%
interesting man in the world.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well, I read
an interview with him

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:84%
recently, where he said
he went and he auditioned,

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
and he did the whole accent
thing and had a beard.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:90%
And he auditioned for it.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And then the people
who were looking

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
for this character for
this series of commercials

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.159 align:middle line:84%
called his agent said,
we liked what he did.

00:19:05.159 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:90%
And we really enjoyed it.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:90%
But we wanted somebody younger.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.972 align:middle line:84%
So the agent called
him and said,

00:19:09.972 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:90%
they wanted somebody younger.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how could
anybody younger have

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:90%
had all of those experiences?

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:90%
They needed somebody older.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:84%
That's an example of
what I'm talking about.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Some of the principles, I think,
open and blossom a little bit

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.420 align:middle line:90%
earlier.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But attraction, it has
to stay in that bud

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
until you really understand,
find out what it is.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So another few principles
that we're working with--

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to make a
comment on the Ascending

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.904 align:middle line:84%
Principle, the very first one
we talked about of placement.

00:19:45.904 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one
that had the dancers,

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:90%
or was it-- yeah, the dancers.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna ask you about that--
or make a comment later.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:90%
So let me write that down.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: OK.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, go ahead.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well one of my
other favorite principles,

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.840 align:middle line:84%
which is another one that
I would change in the book

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.680 align:middle line:84%
if I could change the books
right now, is gratitude.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I was so excited
a couple of weeks ago.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I read an article
by a physicist--

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.250 align:middle line:90%
no, a brain scientist.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And so he was talking about
what they have learned,

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
because now all the technology
they can do MRIs on your brain,

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and what they've learned
about what parts of your brain

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:84%
light up under
certain circumstances.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that almost
all of the really negative

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.590 align:middle line:84%
emotions, like self-doubt
and guilt and greed and all

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.020 align:middle line:84%
those negative emotions
about yourself,

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:84%
the synapses, the
circuits that light up,

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.830 align:middle line:84%
are all right there
around the amygdala.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they stir up all
kind of fear and fight--

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:90%
fight or flight thing.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:84%
What they then discovered
is, if they can get somebody

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:84%
all wrapped up in greed
and self-pity and then say,

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, pick up a
pen and write down

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:84%
10 things for which
you are grateful,

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:90%
changes the brain altogether.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can feel it.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Different parts of
the brain light up altogether.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's, of course,
in the frontal lobes,

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's in the brain
stem which lights up.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's pretty much a
definition of gratitude to me.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.940 align:middle line:90%
It's the principle that--

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the
Descending Principles.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the principle that takes
you out of the me, me, me

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:33.030 align:middle line:90%
thing that is damaging.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Examples?

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well, just so happens
that John Kennedy's moon

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:90%
principle was also gratitude.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So he was attraction
and gratitude.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:44.525 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: What a guy.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what a guy.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so he was definitely
vulnerable on the planet.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:22:00.590 align:middle line:84%
But a guy who seemed to be
able to remember gratitude.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: To remember what
it is, that life is a gift.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
what else is there

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
to do but be in
receipt of the gift?

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:11.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Being able
we're to give the gift.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: John Kennedy again.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, some more.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: OK, one
more principle.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Silence.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Silence is-- it's
that principle that

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:84%
erupts when you're able to
get your mind to be quiet.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's anything but silent.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like as soon
as your mind is quiet

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:84%
or your head brain
is quiet, your skull

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:84%
becomes in attunement in
alignment with the universe.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're literally hearing
the music of the spheres.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And you are resonant with quite
an amazing galactic energy.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:23:02.616 align:middle line:84%
Favorite example in the silence
area is Albert Einstein.

00:23:02.616 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I've read many, many
stories about how he would

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:84%
anguish over a problem or
something that he was trying

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to put together, and then, the
answer would come to him just

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.440 align:middle line:84%
on awakening from a dream or
just in one of those moments--

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether he
was a meditator or not--

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:84%
but just in those
moments when he

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.120 align:middle line:84%
would be able to get
his brain to be quiet.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
actually, I think

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:84%
it's a Netflix series about him
out right now called "Genius"

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and showing the way he worked
and the abstract way in which

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:84%
his mind worked and how he would
come to his solutions, which

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:84%
were almost like
a kid in a sandbox

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.025 align:middle line:90%
playing on a certain level.

00:23:51.025 --> 00:23:51.825 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:23:51.825 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that playful mind
allowing this to just bubble

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.130 align:middle line:90%
through him.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thanks.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to watch that.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's interesting,

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.513 align:middle line:84%
because it also gets a lot
into his personal life.

00:23:59.513 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was the
point of it is to kind of get

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:84%
at the back story
of the real person,

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.270 align:middle line:84%
not just the genius that brought
certain information through.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So no, I was just going to say
that the advantage of knowing

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
your principles, in knowing
your Invisible Garment

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:84%
is so profound, because
it keeps you sane.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:84%
You can always pull back from
whatever's going on out there,

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot going on out
there right now that that's

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:90%
really troubling people.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:84%
You can always pull back
and say, let me just

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.900 align:middle line:90%
get out of the way here.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Let me stop with my opinions
and my attitudes and my belief

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.880 align:middle line:84%
systems and see how
my principle wants

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:90%
to show up in this moment.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
a situation in which someone

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:84%
has come to you to have
you explain their Invisible

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Garment to them.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And you discover that they're
living virtually the opposite

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.610 align:middle line:84%
of their principles and what
their life looks like and then

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:90%
when it becomes like.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Everybody likes to hear
those kinds of stories.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well, everybody except
the person who's living it.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who's
going through it.

00:25:16.405 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah,
that is probably one

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:84%
of the most difficult
conversations

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.550 align:middle line:90%
that I ever have with anyone.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Because then, we have to
talk about the difference

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:90%
in free will and willfulness.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, and ego.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
where I wanted to go.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: We learn to talk
about how you can willfully

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.970 align:middle line:84%
prevent yourself from allowing
your principles to express

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.230 align:middle line:90%
through you.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.367 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
it's very painful.

00:25:49.367 --> 00:25:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But don't you find
a huge percentage of people

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:84%
actually do that, trying to
blast through on a concept

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
or idea or whatever
it is they've

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.451 align:middle line:90%
patterned their life by?

00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I don't know if I
would say huge percentage.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I would say most
of the people who

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.823 align:middle line:84%
come to me for private
consultations, when I start

00:26:04.823 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:84%
talking to them about
their principles,

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
can look back in time
and say, oh, there

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:16.620 align:middle line:84%
was that decision that I made
that I didn't really make,

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.610 align:middle line:90%
something that just showed up.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:21.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was, oh, I can see now.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:84%
It was that principle
operating through me.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And so then I can
grab on to that

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and say, yes,
remember that feeling.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Memorize that feeling.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:84%
What would it be like if you
let everything in your life

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.690 align:middle line:90%
happen that way?

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So yes, when people come
to me because they're

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:84%
struggling with
something, and I have

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.770 align:middle line:84%
to talk to them about
stubbornness and free will

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and fear and the belief
that what they were told

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
in school about how they
should be may be wrong,

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.130 align:middle line:84%
those are difficult
conversations.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:06.732 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
very liberating.

00:27:06.732 --> 00:27:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I'm kind of looking

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.780 align:middle line:84%
to hear is where someone
has embraced that,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and they've
instituted that change

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:84%
to honor that particular
principle in themselves,

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and boom, you do have
a flip of their lives.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.886 align:middle line:90%
And you do see that happen?

00:27:19.886 --> 00:27:20.685 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes.

00:27:20.685 --> 00:27:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And even in myself, I
see it all the time.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I see something
happening in the world

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:84%
that I respond to so differently
than I did when I was a younger

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:37.960 align:middle line:84%
woman when I
thought I knew stuff

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and/or when I thought
I was supposed

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.240 align:middle line:84%
to make decisions and
follow through them.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is your
primary principle?

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:45.997 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Humility.

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what's that?

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.400 align:middle line:90%
How does that show itself?

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: That's one of
the Descending Principles.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And humility is a
principle that is

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:57.550 align:middle line:84%
about self-knowing,
authentic self-knowing.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not about being a doormat.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I think I mentioned this
in our last interview.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The angels told me it
is equally as arrogant

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:84%
to think too little
of yourself as it is

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:90%
to think too much of yourself.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So humility comes right there
on that line right in between.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So what it does is that it
demands of me that I make

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:26.080 align:middle line:84%
sure I'm not mouthing
some opinions, some ideas,

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:84%
some concept, some belief system
that is not mine and that is--

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that may have lies
wrapped in it.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So I
have to constantly

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:44.320 align:middle line:84%
be digging for the lies that
might be expressing themselves

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:90%
through me.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
about in relationship?

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I assume that there's
a heavy relational component

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:51.130 align:middle line:90%
to this whole system.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you're
humility, and your husband,

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.037 align:middle line:84%
who works in the film
industry, what is he?

00:28:57.037 --> 00:28:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: He's creativity.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
well, there you go.

00:28:59.495 --> 00:29:00.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.390 align:middle line:90%
He was already well-placed.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah, but that is a
very interesting piece of work.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Your marriage is
infinitely easier

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.710 align:middle line:84%
if you know what your
spouse's principles are,

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and you can observe them
living their principles.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.767 align:middle line:84%
Your parenting is
infinitely easier

00:29:22.767 --> 00:29:24.725 align:middle line:84%
if you know what your
child's principle source.

00:29:24.725 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that's where
I wanted to go with this.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:27.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
some relationship situations

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:84%
that you've read
for, for example,

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and what the
misunderstanding was

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and how they were able to come
to a higher place with it.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Very often, very
often couples think differently.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.390 align:middle line:84%
They are two people
that think differently.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's say one
person's mental body--

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.840 align:middle line:84%
they're mercury principle,
but their mental body is

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:90%
in silence--

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and the other person's
is in creativity.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So this person operates by
talking through and playing

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:84%
with and imagining,
and this person

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.580 align:middle line:90%
needs solitude and silence.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So if they don't recognize that
in each other, what they end up

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.271 align:middle line:84%
doing is trying to make the
other person be more like them.

00:30:21.271 --> 00:30:23.770 align:middle line:10%
So the silence person is going
to say, stop talking so much.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:10%
And the creativity
person is gonna

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.840 align:middle line:10%
say, why don't you
ever talk to me?

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we share?

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how do they
find the middle ground there?

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Once they recognize that's
their primary principle,

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.790 align:middle line:90%
then how do they bridge that?

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Just by acceptance?

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just acceptance.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Just by
understanding what's going on.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And let the other
person be as they are.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing
that we tend to do

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:52.640 align:middle line:84%
as humans is if you're different
from me in any way whatsoever,

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.440 align:middle line:90%
one of us has to be wrong.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to make me
wrong by talking so much when--

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:90%
When you put that--

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I call this putting down your
end of the rope in tug-of-war.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.804 align:middle line:84%
You can't play tug-of-war
if one person puts down

00:31:09.804 --> 00:31:10.720 align:middle line:90%
their end of the rope.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.450 align:middle line:84%
If you understand that that
person needs to express

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and this person needs
solitude, then it's fine.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Then, it works.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a mutual admiration
kind of thing.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are, if you
can bring to mind an example

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.821 align:middle line:84%
of a couple, that was
just not getting--

00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:31.070 align:middle line:84%
they weren't getting along,
they weren't understanding

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.350 align:middle line:84%
each other in the way the
other thought, and what

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:84%
those principles were, and
some of the beauty of what

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.280 align:middle line:90%
happened after?

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I have to preface this
by saying it's also cultural.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Because we do live in
a patriarchal world.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's
changing, we still

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:90%
live in a patriarchal system.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So a lot of times
when people get married,

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:58.130 align:middle line:84%
especially if they marry
young, there's an agreement.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking of a
couple who came to me.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.230 align:middle line:90%
And she was--

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I think her
principle was beauty.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I think her primary
principle was beauty.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And his primary
principle was focus.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.600 align:middle line:90%
So there was this agreement--

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that they knew
that this was an agreement--

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:22.130 align:middle line:84%
but she was supposed
to be pretty.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And she was connected to nature,
and she had stones and spirits

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.240 align:middle line:90%
around the house.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was focused and
masculine and in charge.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And whenever she started
stepping a little bit more

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.040 align:middle line:84%
into her own power
and wasn't just

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.660 align:middle line:84%
the trophy wife or the pretty
one, he was threatened.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:90%
His position was threatened.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But when he tried to
take control over that,

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.250 align:middle line:90%
her position was threatened.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So when they came
to me, and we really

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.400 align:middle line:84%
talked about what beauty
is and what focus is

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and how they can
actually combine

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
in a really
incredible way, then,

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
without threatening
each other, they

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.630 align:middle line:84%
can be inspirational
for each other.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:15.860 align:middle line:90%
It changed.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.120 align:middle line:90%
It changed for them.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.140 align:middle line:84%
You broached the subject
just a little bit ago,

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to go more into
the notion of using this

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.660 align:middle line:84%
for rearing our children and
how some of the experiences

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.990 align:middle line:90%
you've had--

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.860 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit, I want to get
to the family with the three

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:37.770 align:middle line:84%
kids that you mentioned in
one of your articles I read,

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that each one of them had
a different principle.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'll remind you
of those principles,

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and you'll know which
family I'm talking about.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Good.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know it's hard
when you've written something.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, that
was forever ago.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
use of it in the family.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.997 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well, it
just kind of almost

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:54.830 align:middle line:84%
goes without saying
when you think about it.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:58.280 align:middle line:84%
If you know what your
child's gift is and you

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.180 align:middle line:84%
know that these
formative years need

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to be set up for him or
her to deliver that gift,

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.949 align:middle line:84%
then, you make
different decisions

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:14.360 align:middle line:84%
than you would if you're just
trying to socialize the kid

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.639 align:middle line:84%
and make the kid be nice
and make the kid know

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.292 align:middle line:90%
what the rules are.

00:34:18.292 --> 00:34:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the really
interesting things

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.679 align:middle line:84%
that has happened
since I spoke with you

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:84%
last is that I've been
working with mothers

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.710 align:middle line:90%
of autistic children.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:26.719 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.204 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: And it's an amazing--

00:34:28.204 --> 00:34:29.287 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about this.

00:34:29.287 --> 00:34:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we tend to
think that they're

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.449 align:middle line:84%
trapped inside some reality that
we can't reach, but you found

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:36.350 align:middle line:90%
that's not true.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Not necessarily true
at all, or really, not true

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:39.820 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.822 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not true, yeah.

00:34:41.822 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: It's a spectrum
that we're not used to

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.830 align:middle line:90%
and we're not familiar with.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's often a spectrum
that brings forth

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:84%
behaviors that are not
generally accepted in public.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And so of course, the parents
have to adjust to that.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you can also know what
that child's primary gift is

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and what that child's
mental body influence is,

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:84%
you can find very different
language and very different

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.610 align:middle line:90%
ways of communicating.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of these children
are completely nonverbal.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And so there have to be
communication systems set up

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:30.040 align:middle line:84%
within the family dynamic
that are nonverbal

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:35.320 align:middle line:84%
in order to include and
encompass that child's gift.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did you start this--

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.380 align:middle line:84%
on this path as a result of
relationship with Suzy Miller?

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPLAN: Suzy Miller and
her work with autistic kids?

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:44.350 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:45.150 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.550 align:middle line:10%
Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:47.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.760 align:middle line:10%
OK, good.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.218 align:middle line:10%
Well, if anybody's
interested, they

00:35:49.218 --> 00:35:52.940 align:middle line:10%
can watch my interview with Suzy
Miller in the archives as well.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:10%
But let's talk of some
specific things that you saw

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.980 align:middle line:10%
occur when working
with these kids.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well, what
was really interesting

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:05.680 align:middle line:84%
was that in the beginning of
working with these mothers,

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.479 align:middle line:84%
they needed to know
their principles first.

00:36:09.479 --> 00:36:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, so they
could come from their position

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:12.220 align:middle line:90%
of strength.

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So when I started this class,
the first class that I started,

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I thought we would be spending
the whole time talking

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:90%
about the children.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:20.650 align:middle line:90%
And we weren't.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.530 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
about the mothers.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the
first thing that you

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:31.850 align:middle line:84%
have to do whenever you are in
a situation that you don't get,

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:32.650 align:middle line:90%
is know yourself.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.170 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:40.450 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that you have to
do as a mother of a child who's

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:46.730 align:middle line:84%
not just perfectly fitting in
the boxes is you go to a why

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:47.530 align:middle line:90%
me?

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:50.140 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It can sometimes
be an oy, why me?

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Or it can sometimes be why
did this child choose me?

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.230 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is, the first
thing that we worked with

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:02.800 align:middle line:84%
was having the mothers
understand themselves.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing that you
do is you take your principles.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you take your
child's principles.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And you see where the
crossover points are and/or

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.570 align:middle line:90%
where the differences are.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.240 align:middle line:84%
It's similar to what
I was just talking

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.450 align:middle line:90%
about with married couples.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
If you think one way and your
child thinks another way,

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.300 align:middle line:84%
or if your emotional
body is perfectly stable

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and your child's emotional
body is in randomness,

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.380 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying
to get that child

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to control their
emotional body, you

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.490 align:middle line:84%
provide a space in which that
emotional body's expression

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.140 align:middle line:90%
is appropriate.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a very deep but
pretty specific and concrete

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:52.390 align:middle line:90%
way to deal with relationships.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you put it out
with the whole family.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:38:00.365 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
whole tribal cloak.

00:38:00.365 --> 00:38:03.490 align:middle line:90%


00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.950 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I
want to thank you for this.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:09.340 align:middle line:84%
A woman listened to
our interview before.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:10%
She contacted me
immediately, and she said,

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.310 align:middle line:10%
The Invisible Garment
needs its own web site.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:90%
And let me give you some ideas.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Let me send you some ideas.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:10%
So we now have our own website,
theinvisiblegarment.com.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:28.750 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPLAN: And so she has
become a very, very good friend

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:10%
and a very strong
endorser of this work.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And she's the one who
gave me the term tribal

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:40.540 align:middle line:84%
garment, where you just look
at the whole story of what's

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.570 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:43.111 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
also go back, if you

00:38:43.111 --> 00:38:45.278 align:middle line:84%
can find your parents
information and your siblings'

00:38:45.278 --> 00:38:46.077 align:middle line:90%
information--

00:38:46.077 --> 00:38:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you have to
have the birth times or just

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.444 align:middle line:90%
the birth date?

00:38:49.444 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You can actually,
if you have a birth date

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.790 align:middle line:90%
and place, you can know enough.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.250 align:middle line:84%
You can look up a chart and
just call it a noon birth time.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because most people
don't know their parents' birth

00:38:59.650 --> 00:38:59.780 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.988 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right, birth times.

00:39:00.988 --> 00:39:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But the sun stays in
the same place all day.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And Mercury and Venus and Mars
stay in the same place all day.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And all the galactic ones
stay in the same place

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:14.380 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, so you
know enough from just that.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.620 align:middle line:84%
That's true with
business people, too.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.726 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at what's
going on in a business

00:39:19.726 --> 00:39:21.100 align:middle line:84%
community, you
don't have to say,

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.766 align:middle line:84%
I need your birth
time, date, and place.

00:39:22.766 --> 00:39:24.760 align:middle line:84%
You can say, when
is your birthday?

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really, where were you born?

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.360 align:middle line:84%
[CH CH CH CH] Go
look that person up,

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can start
looking at that kind

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.009 align:middle line:90%
of tribal interfacing.

00:39:32.009 --> 00:39:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you worked
with businesses on that level

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:34.390 align:middle line:90%
before?

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: I haven't.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.360 align:middle line:90%
I haven't.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
be interesting.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Mm-hmm.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:37.525 align:middle line:90%


00:39:37.525 --> 00:39:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In one of your
articles or the book

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I was reading about, the
particular aspect of the moon

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.080 align:middle line:84%
principle and kids, in
particular, understanding

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.730 align:middle line:90%
your kid's moon principle.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.360 align:middle line:90%
So why would that be?

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Why would the moon come in as a
particular influence with kids

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.680 align:middle line:90%
in particular?

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I understand
what you're asking.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.030 align:middle line:84%
The moon principle
is your mastery.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So the moon principle
is something

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.630 align:middle line:84%
that you come in
with from birth,

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.240 align:middle line:84%
from past lifetimes
or other dimensions,

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.930 align:middle line:84%
or however that is,
however that works.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:15.970 align:middle line:84%
The moon principle is so
deeply embedded in you

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:18.680 align:middle line:84%
that you can't imagine that
everybody doesn't have it,

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.950 align:middle line:90%
whatever your mastery is.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So kids, when
they're really young,

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that's basically
what they're doing.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what basically--

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're playing
out what they came in with.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so if you understand
your child's moon principle,

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:84%
then you understand what a
lot of that behavior is about.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:84%
An example that I'm
remembering from one of my kids

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is my son was
probably about three

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:51.210 align:middle line:84%
when he came in one
morning and just grabbed me

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:53.670 align:middle line:84%
around the knees and
started hugging me.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're the
best mommy I have ever had.

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I think I'm
the only mommy you've ever had.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.530 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, no.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.310 align:middle line:90%
I've had a lot of moms.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were mean.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were fat.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were really ugly.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.680 align:middle line:90%
I just never had a mom like you.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I was just kind of
blown away by that,

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and then, I discovered his
moon principle is memory.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: So oh, right.

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So he came in with--
now, interestingly,

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.250 align:middle line:90%
he does not remember that event.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.442 align:middle line:84%
Every time I asked him
about it he says, no,

00:41:34.442 --> 00:41:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember ever
saying that to you.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember any
of my others mothers.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well it starts
fading as they get older.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.616 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Well, right.

00:41:39.616 --> 00:41:41.550 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they get
into school and it's not

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:44.190 align:middle line:84%
appropriate to remember
your past lives,

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:47.450 align:middle line:84%
you learn very quickly
not to remember them.

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.651 align:middle line:84%
So my son was just
about three and a half,

00:41:50.651 --> 00:41:52.650 align:middle line:84%
three and three-quarters--
something like that--

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:55.620 align:middle line:84%
years old when a very similar
thing happened when he was

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.640 align:middle line:90%
telling me--

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.620 align:middle line:90%
I was making a comment to him.

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, don't
worry about it, Mom.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I did the same
thing to you before.

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Pardon me?

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.530 align:middle line:90%
So we started talking.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what are
you talking about?

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, a long time ago.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, were we?

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:14.190 align:middle line:90%
In a place called England.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And he started telling me this
entire past life and who I was,

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.540 align:middle line:84%
what had happened to his wife,
the mother, and what with me.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was really fascinating,
because it helped actually

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:29.570 align:middle line:84%
fill in some pictures
about our personal history

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.570 align:middle line:84%
together that was-- a piece
that had been missing,

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.230 align:middle line:84%
he actually supplied
it in that memory.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I said well, when
did you see this?

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh
when I was supposed

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:41.726 align:middle line:84%
to be taking a nap at
Busy Bee, nursery school.

00:42:41.726 --> 00:42:43.890 align:middle line:90%
He was looking at past lives.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's really interesting.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as
far as kids go, you

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.960 align:middle line:84%
say they also have
an ethical body.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.824 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:42:52.824 --> 00:42:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Everybody
has an ethical body.

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: The
ethical body is read

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:02.280 align:middle line:84%
by your Ascendant, what was
the Ascendant the moment

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.400 align:middle line:90%
you were born?

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.144 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
that you need birth time.

00:43:06.144 --> 00:43:08.310 align:middle line:84%
If you're gonna find out
what their ethical body is,

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:09.930 align:middle line:84%
you need birth time,
because you need to know

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:11.150 align:middle line:90%
exactly what the Ascendant was.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.356 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:11.356 --> 00:43:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So explain what the
ethical body is.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.511 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: The ethical
body is the principle

00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:19.500 align:middle line:84%
that influences you when
you are making decisions,

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.810 align:middle line:90%
making big decisions.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:24.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting.

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.970 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those
times when people

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:30.150 align:middle line:84%
can look back and think about
some of the big decisions

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:31.950 align:middle line:90%
that you made--

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.410 align:middle line:84%
where to go to school
or who to marry

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:39.420 align:middle line:84%
or when to have children or
some of those bigger decisions

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.460 align:middle line:90%
that really affect your life.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of them, or at
least the ones that were right,

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.850 align:middle line:84%
were when you just
kind of sat back,

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and your ethical
principle came forward.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that were wrong the
ones that you willfully made,

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.940 align:middle line:84%
where you might have been going
against your ethical principle,

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:90%
stand out as wrong.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what happens
when your ethical principle

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.790 align:middle line:90%
is beauty?

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:06.660 align:middle line:90%
What's that look like?

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.962 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Beauty is a principle
that is connected to like

00:44:10.962 --> 00:44:11.762 align:middle line:90%
cellular--

00:44:11.762 --> 00:44:16.410 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:21.090 align:middle line:84%
what's the word I'm trying to
look for-- balance, I guess.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.130 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to the
stones, the minerals,

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:30.150 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful stones where
you can see the makeup

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.744 align:middle line:90%
of their stone of their cells.

00:44:33.744 --> 00:44:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does
that be applied

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.579 align:middle line:90%
in an ethics perspective?

00:44:37.579 --> 00:44:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You would
always be looking

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:84%
for what creates
balance and harmony

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and what's going to create
the most efficient expression,

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:54.200 align:middle line:84%
choice that's going to create
the most efficient expression.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Beauty is a difficult principle
for some people because

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.850 align:middle line:84%
of the way our culture
defines beauty.

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And so a lot of times,
I'll find one of two things

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
with people who have beauty
in their garment pattern.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.580 align:middle line:90%
One is that they are pretty.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:14.670 align:middle line:84%
They are pretty people, and they
have spent their whole lives

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:21.930 align:middle line:84%
being frustrated because their
inner self is never noticed.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.741 align:middle line:84%
They can't get to the
substance of themselves,

00:45:24.741 --> 00:45:26.490 align:middle line:84%
because there's so
much projection on them

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.810 align:middle line:90%
for being pretty.

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
one is the opposite.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:31.980 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
symmetrical features,

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
thin, lithe bodies.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And they have always battled
with not being pretty enough.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So that
one is one that

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.390 align:middle line:84%
specifically requires an
internal investigation in order

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.190 align:middle line:90%
to express.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
find that principle

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:53.897 align:middle line:84%
shows up more often in women
than men, or is it equal?

00:45:53.897 --> 00:45:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: That's a hard
question for me to answer,

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.890 align:middle line:84%
because most of my
clients are women.

00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.710 align:middle line:90%
There ya go.

00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:59.510 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:04.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about dream time,
how the Invisible Garment shows

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:06.300 align:middle line:90%
up in our dream time.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well,
this has been really

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:11.400 align:middle line:90%
an interesting unfoldment.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.620 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I have
to tell you that what

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I learned about dreaming when
I was asleep for two years

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:20.250 align:middle line:84%
is counter to what
almost everyone else

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.980 align:middle line:90%
teaches about dreaming.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.940 align:middle line:84%
My teachers told me that
when we go to sleep,

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:31.410 align:middle line:84%
our bodies begin a
physiological regeneration.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness
begins a journey

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.410 align:middle line:84%
back towards source in
order to plug-in, something

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:43.620 align:middle line:84%
like an iPhone, just to get back
to the soul, to be its source.

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:47.850 align:middle line:84%
On that journey, consciousness
encounters all possibility,

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:53.910 align:middle line:84%
all potential, all
probability, all information.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:58.980 align:middle line:84%
When we start to wake up,
then, our personal minds

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.670 align:middle line:84%
writes a story
about what we just

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:04.950 align:middle line:90%
encountered in consciousness.

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So yes, that story
appears to be personal.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we use personal--
our personal lexicon

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.160 align:middle line:84%
of images and ideas and people
and faces and experiences

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.660 align:middle line:90%
to write the story.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:19.920 align:middle line:84%
But the actual event
was an energetic event

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.820 align:middle line:90%
in collective consciousness.

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:26.125 align:middle line:84%
When you're removed from this
realm, it's not recognizable.

00:47:26.125 --> 00:47:27.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
you would bring back

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:30.690 align:middle line:84%
without some interpretation
and story from the mind.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So when we're listening
to dreams, for example,

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:39.810 align:middle line:84%
in my dream circles, we
say, what did this person

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:43.770 align:middle line:84%
experience in
consciousness that inspired

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:45.730 align:middle line:90%
her to write this story?

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking for that
experience beyond the story.

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:middle line:84%
After The Invisible
Garment work came in,

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.890 align:middle line:84%
we started noticing that
if you pay attention

00:47:55.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:middle line:84%
to where the moon is
when you have that dream

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and what other planets the
moon might be aspecting,

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:12.280 align:middle line:84%
this story has something
to do with your principle

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.080 align:middle line:90%
in that planet.

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.980 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let
me explain this.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's say the moon
is in the sign

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.740 align:middle line:84%
that it was in the night of your
birth, the day of your birth.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.690 align:middle line:90%
So in my case, it was Gemini.

00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's say I'm having
a dream on a Gemini moon.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And the lunar calendar
tells me that it

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:37.170 align:middle line:84%
was in a positive aspect
to Mercury that night

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:39.570 align:middle line:90%
when I had that dream.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:42.600 align:middle line:90%
My Gemini principle is movement.

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.570 align:middle line:84%
My Mercury principle, or my
moon principle is movement.

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:48.060 align:middle line:90%
My Mercury principle is silence.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So in trying to understand
the story that I wrote,

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm also learning something
about the relationship

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:58.680 align:middle line:84%
between movement and silence,
those two principles.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.700 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
when you start

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:07.230 align:middle line:84%
seeing that there are
patterns to how you dream,

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and there is deeper information
about the principles

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:15.600 align:middle line:90%
that you live in your dream.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.030 align:middle line:90%
It's complex.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Yet, it requires work.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:23.040 align:middle line:84%
You have to pay attention, and
you have to do your own work.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And every dreamer
dreams differently.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But this is one of those
languages you can interpret

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.160 align:middle line:90%
through, Invisible Garment.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about other
things that come into dreams?

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.620 align:middle line:84%
You were also talking
about factors,

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:39.586 align:middle line:84%
like color and sound and
such, and how that factors in.

00:49:39.586 --> 00:49:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: OK.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:45.320 align:middle line:84%
A few years later, after the
Invisible Garment work came in,

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I had yet another
mystical experience.

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, I was shown
a series of concentric balls,

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:57.810 align:middle line:90%
spheres that were color.

00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that
within these colors

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:04.170 align:middle line:90%
the principles were located.

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So there were four principles
in each of these spheres

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.000 align:middle line:90%
that I saw.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, they turned
around, and they--

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:14.550 align:middle line:84%
these spheres
turned around and on

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.040 align:middle line:84%
what I call the other
side of the rainbow,

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:19.050 align:middle line:90%
there were different colors.

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:21.150 align:middle line:90%
And the principles had moved.

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So I was being shown, I felt,
that the principles participate

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.450 align:middle line:84%
with each other in
a way that creates

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:37.320 align:middle line:84%
a collective energy that
flows through our lives

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.220 align:middle line:84%
but also flows through
our cultures, that

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.010 align:middle line:84%
flows through our
societies, and whatever.

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So you can look at the dreams
and the colors that show up

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.100 align:middle line:84%
in the dreams, and those colors
will give you information

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.740 align:middle line:90%
about that particular flow.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.880 align:middle line:90%
Let me get more concrete.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's take blue,
the color blue.

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:03.650 align:middle line:84%
In this work that I was
taught, the way I was shown it

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:10.370 align:middle line:84%
in this mystical download,
blue is a frequency that--

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:11.990 align:middle line:90%
it's a metaphor for frequency.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
literally your sweater.

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:19.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about blue
as a frequency that is--

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:24.740 align:middle line:84%
it influences culture and
people in very specific,

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.450 align:middle line:90%
rational thinking.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So blue is the
sphere of science.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Blue is the sphere
just give me the facts,

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.570 align:middle line:90%
and I'll work with them.

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Green is the sphere of
balance and harmony,

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.120 align:middle line:84%
so green is the
sphere of healing

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and wholeness and the new
sciences, so to speak.

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.660 align:middle line:84%
On the other side
of the rainbow,

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.260 align:middle line:84%
blue and green
combine to, what I

00:51:51.260 --> 00:52:00.050 align:middle line:84%
call, turquoise, that new way
of looking at healing and fact,

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:05.480 align:middle line:84%
bringing them together to place
them in a contextual context

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.070 align:middle line:84%
so that it's a deeper
level of truth.

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:09.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a more evolved
level of truth.

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:11.810 align:middle line:84%
The other side of the
rainbow is an evolution

00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:14.280 align:middle line:90%
from where we are now.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you take the principle
purity, which is in blue,

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and take it to the other side
of the rainbow in turquoise,

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:27.260 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a principle that
is looking for the right way

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.530 align:middle line:90%
to speak truth.

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So if turquoise
is in your dream,

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.640 align:middle line:84%
then you can recognize
that you are perceiving,

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:42.500 align:middle line:84%
or that you did perceive,
something about that logos,

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:47.300 align:middle line:84%
that healed thought, pure
thought word turquoise energy.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Does that
make sense to you?

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it does.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.235 align:middle line:90%
It's layered, and it's complex.

00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:54.500 align:middle line:90%
The system is very layered.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: But this
color information

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.180 align:middle line:84%
is so valuable,
because it helps you

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:03.290 align:middle line:84%
see the world through
the perspective of how

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:06.260 align:middle line:84%
all of these energies, how
all of these frequencies

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.380 align:middle line:90%
are trying to evolve society.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: It takes
it out of the--

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.410 align:middle line:84%
my opinion about what should
be happening and into the

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:18.860 align:middle line:84%
let me look at what's actually
happening perspective.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:19.926 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:19.926 --> 00:53:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, that's fascinating.

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:23.870 align:middle line:84%
I personally have a love
affair with color myself.

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And years ago when there
was very little known on it,

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I read every book and used
to teach color therapy.

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And it has a profound
effect on our understanding

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and being able to work
with forces, and of course,

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:38.660 align:middle line:84%
all the well-known work
with color in the sciences

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.727 align:middle line:84%
and light and such
from the '30s and '40s

00:53:41.727 --> 00:53:43.310 align:middle line:84%
where they were using
it in hospitals.

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:45.244 align:middle line:84%
But in any event,
it's a worthy endeavor

00:53:45.244 --> 00:53:47.160 align:middle line:84%
to follow through on
this study of the colors.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.830 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I wish we had had time
to get into a little bit more.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:53.450 align:middle line:10%
This is probably the
most interesting part

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:55.404 align:middle line:10%
of all of the work
that I've done.

00:53:55.404 --> 00:53:57.070 align:middle line:10%
I want to say one
thing before we close.

00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:58.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, do.

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So my web
master and I are

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:07.640 align:middle line:84%
going to offer some very
specific things for people who

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.350 align:middle line:90%
have watched this interview.

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, lovely.

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:12.920 align:middle line:90%
So what's the code word?

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: The code word is Gaia.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gaia.

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:18.585 align:middle line:90%
Surprise.

00:54:18.585 --> 00:54:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah, so they'll
be available on the web

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.534 align:middle line:90%
site, theinvisiblegarment.com.

00:54:23.534 --> 00:54:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they put in
the little code word, Gaia,

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.027 align:middle line:84%
and then there is something
there for them to--

00:54:28.027 --> 00:54:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: There are four or
five different options there

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.790 align:middle line:84%
for classes on
Invisible Garment,

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:39.890 align:middle line:84%
for classes on the color work,
for combinations of classes

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:41.450 align:middle line:90%
for private sessions with me.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:42.911 align:middle line:90%
There'll be special offers.

00:54:42.911 --> 00:54:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, very nice.

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:45.110 align:middle line:90%
That's very generous of you.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:47.813 align:middle line:84%
And it's good to get a
little deeper overlay

00:54:47.813 --> 00:54:49.259 align:middle line:90%
in our second chat here.

00:54:49.259 --> 00:54:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Thanks for having me.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:51.383 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:54:51.383 --> 00:54:53.880 align:middle line:10%
Again, the name of the book
is "The Invisible Garment,"

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.240 align:middle line:10%
which you can find on Amazon
and other booksellers.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:59.780 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
