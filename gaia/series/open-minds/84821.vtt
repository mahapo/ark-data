00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Dr. Joe

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.270 align:middle line:10%
Dispenza, we talked
about the placebo effect

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.360 align:middle line:10%
and that we are the effect.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:10%
It's not something
outside of ourselves.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:10%
That information matters.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.130 align:middle line:84%
What also matters is how these
subconscious patterns end up

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:84%
ruling us, individually
and collectively.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to take a
look at the collective belief

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and also why we're able to
affect each other's quantum

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:84%
field in areas such
as remote healing.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Again, fabulous
talking with you.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:84%
That last conversation
was hot, and we

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:90%
said we were going to pick up.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And we want to pick up with
the notion of perceptions

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs before
we get into this.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have a really cool
video to watch in a moment.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>JOE DISPENZA: Sure.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you think about
it, most of our thoughts

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:10%
and feelings come from
our past experiences.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:10%
We said in the last episode
that our brain is an artifact.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:10%
It's a record of all the things
we've learned and experienced.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:10%
Our brain is a reflection
of our external environment.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.060 align:middle line:10%
And every time we
have a new experience,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:10%
those experiences stamp
networks of neurons into place.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:84%
The end product
of that experience

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:90%
is called an emotion.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at how you think
and how you feel, for the most

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.200 align:middle line:84%
part, it comes
from our memories.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.319 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a
series of thoughts

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that are connected to
a series of feelings,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:84%
you have a thought that's
connected to a feeling,

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and a thought connected to
a feeling, a thought that's

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.204 align:middle line:84%
connected to a feeling--
that's called an attitude.

00:01:46.204 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
series of good thoughts

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.612 align:middle line:84%
that are connected to a series
of good feelings, you say hey,

00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
you need to hang
out with me today.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:90%
I have a pretty attitude.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a series
of negative thoughts

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.690 align:middle line:84%
that are connected
to some bad feelings,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:84%
you say you have a pretty
bad attitude today.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So how you think and how you
feel creates a state of being.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So attitudes are
shortened states of being.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.819 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you take an attitude, an
attitude, an attitude, and you

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:84%
string attitudes together,
that creates a belief.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Now a belief is
just the thought you

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:84%
keep thinking over and over
again until you hardwire it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And beliefs are created
from past experiences,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.450 align:middle line:84%
so the very boundaries of
our beliefs are how we feel.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So when our beliefs
are challenged,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:90%
it usually doesn't feel right.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.205 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So, if how
you think and how you feel

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
creates a state of being, and
an attitude is a state of being,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're chunking
different attitudes together,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.740 align:middle line:84%
then a belief is an
extended state of being.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.805 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So if you
keep thinking and feeling

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and feeling and thinking,
as we said in the last show,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:84%
you condition the body to
become the subconscious mind.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:90%
The body becomes the mind.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So most beliefs are
subconscious states of being.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know that
we have beliefs about God,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
about money, about
relationships, about love,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:84%
about freedom, because they're
programmed subconsciously.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So then if you string a
belief, a belief, a belief,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and a belief together,
that creates a perception.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And our perceptions
have everything

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to do with the choices
we make, the things

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
we create in our life, the
behaviors that we demonstrate,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and even the relationships
that we have.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So thoughts and feelings
create attitudes,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
attitudes create beliefs, and
beliefs create perceptions.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So then if a series of
beliefs creates perceptions,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
then most people are
perceiving their life

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of the
past, and they will only

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
look for the
familiar, which means

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
there's a good possibility
that they're editing out

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:90%
most of reality.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: So--

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.922 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tom Campbell calls
that rendering of reality.

00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:51.629 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Collectively
or individually.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.799 align:middle line:84%
It's rendered according to that
thing you're talking about.

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: We could call
it pattern recognition.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is kind of like
a video, rendering a video.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.588 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:04:00.588 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And you filter.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's right.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.113 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: It's a filter.

00:04:03.113 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting, because
most people's beliefs

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.500 align:middle line:84%
are subconscious
states of being.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And they only become conscious
of those beliefs when they're

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.935 align:middle line:84%
initiated in their life, or
challenged in their life,

00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and then they have to
reconstruct the belief, which

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
means in order to
change a belief

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:84%
or perception about
yourself and your life,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
you have to change how
you think and feel.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.754 align:middle line:84%
You have to change
your state of being.

00:04:23.754 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:90%
So now, I have a question then.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.845 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference between
habitual thought and belief?

00:04:29.845 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Is it essentially
the same thing?

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: It's the same thing.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:84%
A habitual thought
ultimately becomes a belief.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.819 align:middle line:84%
But there's an
emotional component

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:90%
that goes along with it, right?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Because most people, you say
to them, hey, I don't know,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Jesus Christ was married.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that doesn't feel right.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
challenging their belief.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of your beliefs
come from past experiences,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and your exposure to
experiences in the past.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.021 align:middle line:84%
So all beliefs,
then, your beliefs

00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
are different than my beliefs.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I grew up thinking
Jesus Christ was Italian,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
because my grandmother
prayed to him in Italian.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:84%
He looked Italian
in all the pictures.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.827 align:middle line:84%
And I was Italian,
raised Italian.

00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
thought he was Nordic.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:84%
He had blonde hair and blue eyes
in the picture in our house.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yes,
so there you go.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So our beliefs, then, based
on our past experiences,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:84%
really begin to cause
us to filter reality

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
telling me off camera

00:05:20.485 --> 00:05:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that in writing this book, you
just kept thinking, holy cow,

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:90%
am I programmed.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And we all are.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no one that's
really-- if you're human

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.848 align:middle line:84%
and you've been around the
planet any length of time,

00:05:31.848 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:84%
you're not exempt
from programming.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And it's
a cultural phenomenon.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.381 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
cultural phenomenon.

00:05:36.381 --> 00:05:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And I think
more so now than ever,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.620 align:middle line:84%
because information is coming
at us at such a rapid rate.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm concerned that the
degree in which we're

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:90%
being program so quickly.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So you don't know that
the water's turning up

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.145 align:middle line:84%
when it's starting to boil
until you start to feel it.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:84%
That's with the advent of
modern times and media.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And on that note, thank you.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:90%
That's a wonderful segue.

a look at a video.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:90%
I love this piece of video.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I had remembered this
particular thing,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:90%
and found the little clip.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:84%
The exact clip we needed about
programming women in America

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:90%
to begin smoking.

That's the example
they use in this.

Public opinion is big business.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:10%
As of 2011, there were more than
7,000 public relations firms

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:10%
in the United States alone.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:10%
These companies work on
behalf of corporations, trade

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:10%
organizations, or
individuals who

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:10%
hope to put a positive
spin on their image,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:10%
whether it's a celebrity
trying to salvage

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:10%
his or her reputation
after a meltdown,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:10%
a musician promoting an
album, or a business combating

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:10%
negative press, chances
are you've recently

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:10%
encountered PR work, and
you might not have known.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:84%
There's no denying
the importance

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:84%
of this multi-billion
dollar industry.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:90%
But what exactly is it?

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:90%
And who invented it?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Here's where it gets crazy.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
The art of modern
public relations

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
can be generally traced to
one man, Edward Bernays.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.600 align:middle line:84%
There were other
earlier innovators,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
but none altered the social
landscape of North America

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.200 align:middle line:90%
as profoundly.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Born in Vienna, Austria
in 1891, Bernays' family

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:84%
moved to New York City about
a year after his birth.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
He was the nephew of Sigmund
Freud, and like his uncle,

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Bernays was captivated
by the convoluted

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:90%
processes of the human mind.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Bernays often consulted
his uncle's work,

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and he was the first to
incorporate psychology

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and other social
sciences into PR.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Yet where Freud sought
to uncover motivations,

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.230 align:middle line:90%
Bernays sought to mask them.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And Bernays' clients were
companies rather than

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:90%
individuals.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
For example, one
of his early cases

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
involved Lucky Strike
Cigarettes in the 1920s.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
The American Tobacco Company
asked him to expand sales.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Women would be an ideal market,
but there were problems.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:84%
First, women didn't care for
the green packaging of Lucky

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Strikes, and the
manufacturer concluded

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.100 align:middle line:84%
that changing the color
was too expensive.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Second, it was taboo for
women to smoke in public.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Bernays took a unique
approach to these obstacles.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
First, he recommended that
if the packs must stay green,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
they should make green the
premier colour of the fashion

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:90%
season.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:84%
During his Green Ball
Campaign, Bernays

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
convinced French designers
to incorporate green

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.950 align:middle line:90%
into their latest fashion lines.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And not just any green, but
the specific dark green shade

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:90%
of Lucky Strike packaging.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.310 align:middle line:84%
He also engineered a green
gala at the Waldorf Astoria,

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
featuring some of society's
most prominent taste makers.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:84%
To address the problem
of smoking in public,

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:84%
he linked Lucky
Strike cigarettes

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to the women's
liberation movement,

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
arranging for young women to
march down Fifth Avenue smoking

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and calling the cigarettes
torches of freedom.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Instead of appearing
to sell cigarettes,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:84%
this seemingly
spontaneous march appeared

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.830 align:middle line:84%
to be a part of the struggle
for gender equality.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, Lucky Strike
cigarettes didn't just

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:84%
have packaging that matched
the latest Parisian fashions,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
they also made a statement
about women's equality.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to see how these
associations could skew market

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:84%
opinion, and the campaign
was enormously successful.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:10%
If you're like most
people, then you probably

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.140 align:middle line:10%
assume that you know where
your opinions come from.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.670 align:middle line:10%
And, if you're like most
people, you're probably wrong.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:10%
Humans tend to
think of each belief

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.240 align:middle line:10%
as the result of a
rational analysis.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:10%
But this is not entirely true.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:10%
Instead, our opinions are subtly
influenced in numerous ways,

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.007 align:middle line:10%
and we're often not
aware of this process.

00:09:48.007 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.647 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm.

00:09:50.647 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Amazing.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.925 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
it's very, very cool,

00:09:53.925 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:84%
because the same
mechanisms that take

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.550 align:middle line:84%
place in Pavlovian conditioning
is the same mechanisms that

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:84%
are taking-- are the
same mechanisms that

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:90%
are taking place here.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when you
give a dog a delicious meal

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and you ring a bell, in
time, in the anticipation

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.950 align:middle line:84%
or the expectation
of that event,

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
begins to produce the
body physiologically

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:90%
preparing itself for the event.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So when you do it
in advertising,

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
you're appealing
to people's lack.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.810 align:middle line:84%
You're appealing to a
certain lack that they have.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But then they begin to
associate some icon.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Some idea.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, for the example
women's freedom,

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:84%
a perfect icon combined
with strong signals,

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.144 align:middle line:84%
sensory signals,
like the color green.

00:10:41.144 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Marching down
Fifth Avenue together.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Marching
down Fifth Avenue.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:90%
And everybody wants freedom.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
be an individual.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you expose people
to that enough times,

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
they're going to, just like
Pavlov's dog, automatically

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
gonna be moved, be
motivated to make

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.160 align:middle line:84%
a choice equal to meet that
exact particular outcome.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
conditioning works.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it makes you
feel foolish as a human being

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:90%
to see what easy targets we are.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And as he said, that
was in what 2011?

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So you can ratchet that
number-- well, the economy,

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.970 align:middle line:84%
maybe knock it
down a little bit.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:84%
7,000 firms in
this country there

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
to shape our perceptions and
desires to drive consumerism.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.372 align:middle line:90%
Which becomes neurotic.

00:11:23.372 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, when I wrote
"You Are the Placebo,"

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
there was a whole element
that was happening

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
to me behind the
scenes of my awareness.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I started becoming so conscious
of so much programming--

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't spend a lot of time
watching syndicated television,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:84%
but if I'm in a
hotel, and sometimes I

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.210 align:middle line:84%
turn it on and watch
the news, I find

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.580 align:middle line:84%
myself responding to TV ads
by yelling at the television

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:90%
like, no way.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.940 align:middle line:84%
No way am I going
to believe that.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you believe that
bugs are going to come out

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:84%
at a certain time a year, and
those exact bugs are going

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:84%
to give you the
flu, and you need

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
a flu shot to counteract
those particular bacteria,

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.560 align:middle line:84%
then you better
take that flu shot.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of those
people who get the flu shot

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:84%
get the flu anyway,
because that's

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:90%
where their attention is.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I personally
don't believe in germs.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:90%
I just don't.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I believed in germs,
I would be sick all the time

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:90%
doing what I do.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.565 align:middle line:84%
So a belief, then, is
a strong statement.

00:12:23.565 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a strong state of being
where mind and body have been

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:84%
programmed in a
particular pattern.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can use beliefs
to our advantage,

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and we can use beliefs,
our conditioning,

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:84%
to our disadvantage,
to programming.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you were
writing "You Are the Placebo,"

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
you really took great pains to
add in here a lot of science

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and measurements so we could
see the exact effect of what

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:90%
our minds are doing.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Why did you start using
all these measurements?

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well,
again, one of the things

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:84%
that happened, Regina, at some
point after "What the Bleep,"

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:84%
after the movie, "What the
Bleep," people were asking,

00:12:59.130 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:90%
how do you do it?

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Why is it so hard to change?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.765 align:middle line:84%
We started teaching workshops,
teaching people the how-to.

00:13:04.765 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And the first year or
so, nothing happened.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
in some of our more

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:84%
progressive workshops,
we saw people standing up

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
that had MS, that were
paralyzed for 10 years,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:84%
walking across the
front of the room.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And we saw people
with lupus get better.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
We saw people with ver-- really
serious chronic conditions,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Hashimoto syndrome, all cancers,
a lot of cancers changing.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And so what I
realized was that we

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.404 align:middle line:84%
were signaling new genes in new
ways right during the event.

00:13:34.404 --> 00:13:35.445 align:middle line:90%
People were transforming.

00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So I
figured, if something

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
is taking place in real
time, we better measure it.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So then, I brought
together a team

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
of researchers, neuroscientists,
and technicians,

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.827 align:middle line:84%
and biologists, and
quantum physicists--

00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:90%
It was a great team.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --to
measure the effects.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.185 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason I wanted to
do that was to demystify it.

00:13:55.185 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
We started teaching these
events called Information

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:90%
To Transformation.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:84%
You give people information,
they learn information,

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:84%
they make new connections
in their brain.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:84%
If they can repeat
that information,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.910 align:middle line:84%
then they're neurologically
wiring networks in there,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:84%
because they're
building a model.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:84%
If you give them
some instruction

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:84%
to get their behaviors
to match their intention,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and they can apply that
information that they've

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:84%
installed the circuits
in their brain,

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:84%
they should have some type
of change or transformation.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But if I can measure that
transformation in real time,

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
then that's more
information for me

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
to teach transformation
the next time.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And we can close the gap between
knowledge and experience.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.030 align:middle line:90%
And so, I am humbled.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:84%
When I say humbled, and at
the same time, so enthusiastic

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:84%
that common people are
doing the uncommon.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And I have been moved
to tears in observing

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.170 align:middle line:90%
some of these changes.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And I love the
idea that you don't

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:84%
have to be a
Buddhist monk, or you

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
don't have to have 40,000
hours of meditation,

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
or you don't have to be an
academic, or a researcher,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
or you don't have to
be a nun, or a priest.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.040 align:middle line:84%
That you can be a common
person, and this is a skill.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And once you understand
how it all works,

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:90%
you can get better at doing it.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And I now know, after all
the research that I've done,

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is that you and I are absolutely
at our best when we get out

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:90%
of the way.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.400 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about that.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And that you will never change
the brain with the brain.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:84%
You will never change
the ego with the ego.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
The program will never
change the program.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:84%
The personality will never
change the personality.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Matter will never change matter.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Only when you and I
become pure consciousness.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you're
going to heal by thought alone,

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
you have to become
thought alone.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And you and I have all the
biological and neurological

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:90%
machinery to do this.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:84%
When we live by the
hormones of stress,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
as we said in the last
show, the majority

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.230 align:middle line:84%
of our attention
and our awareness

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:84%
is on objects, and things, and
peoples, and people in our--

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's on
the material world.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's
the material world.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:90%
It's on our bodies.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's on time.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:84%
The body, the
environment, and time.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.806 align:middle line:84%
And when we put
all our attention

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
on the body, the
environment, and time,

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
then we're slaves to our body,
the environment, and time.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Here's the problem.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
When it comes time to
change or affect reality,

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:84%
we're matter trying
to change matter.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And so, we'll try to
force the outcome.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle line:84%
We'll try to
control the outcome.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:84%
We'll try to
predict the outcome.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll always brace ourselves
for the worst case scenario,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and the future based on
our memory of the past.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.015 align:middle line:84%
Because we're more
particle than wave.

00:16:34.015 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
We're more matter,
and less energy.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.259 align:middle line:84%
And we're vibrating at
the same speed as matter.

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:90%
So we have to be cunning.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:90%
We have to be competitive.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:90%
We have to be manipulative.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.380 align:middle line:84%
We have to do whatever
the limited resources we

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.470 align:middle line:84%
have to affect some
type of change.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we feel
separate from possibility,

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.830 align:middle line:84%
because that's where we're
focusing our attention.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But when we did our research,
we found without a doubt,

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.760 align:middle line:84%
over and over again,
that the moment you

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
become nobody, no
one, no thing--

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that language
is big in the meditation.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.628 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely is.

00:17:05.628 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Because when you become nobody,
no one, no thing, nowhere,

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
in no time, when you become
pure consciousness, a thought

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
in possibility,
that is the moment

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.480 align:middle line:84%
you begin to walk through the
door to the quantum field.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:84%
You can't walk through
the door as a somebody.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:22.798 align:middle line:90%
You can't be a mother.

00:17:22.798 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:90%
You can't be an attorney.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:90%
You can't be a wife.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:90%
You can't be a face.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:90%
You can't be a wardrobe.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.357 align:middle line:84%
You can't be your associations
to cars or your problems.

00:17:33.357 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to become
pure consciousness.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's ironic.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.594 align:middle line:84%
In order for you to
change your body,

00:17:38.594 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:84%
you got to forget
about your body.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.770 align:middle line:84%
In order for you to
change your identity,

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.250 align:middle line:84%
you've got to forget
about your identity.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK now, when
you're doing that meditation,

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.356 align:middle line:84%
you're triggering something,
because a lot of people

00:17:47.356 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:90%
are doing this for their bodies.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And say, for women,
a lot of people

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
are doing it for body image,
because of the self-- because

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.330 align:middle line:84%
of that same industry
we just looked at.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Because of self-loathing.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Body image, loathing is rampant.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly
the majority of women

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:84%
have some issue with
their body, and including

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
the most beautiful, most--
other women would say,

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:90%
you're so beautiful.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:90%
You're so thin.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.350 align:middle line:84%
It's been drilled in so that we
would have that sense of lack,

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:90%
and then want for product.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So in that situation,
how do you see that?

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So let's talk
about it on two levels.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about, if you
want to change something

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
in your environment,
something in your life,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:84%
you want to create
something in your life,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
you have to forget about
your past, present life.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what I mean.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:84%
If you want to heal your body
or change something about

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
your body, you cannot be your
body in order to do that.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
If you want to create
some new future time,

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.180 align:middle line:84%
you have to forget about
predicting the future time

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:84%
based on the past
memory, or linear time.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So when I say that we
have to become nobody,

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.880 align:middle line:84%
what I mean by that
is that we have

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.610 align:middle line:84%
to detach from our
association to the body.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to detach
from our association

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:84%
to the things and people
in our environment

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.860 align:middle line:84%
that reaffirm our identity,
and we have to transcend time.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So only when we do that, if
we're going to heal by thought

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:84%
alone to become thought
alone, that's the moment

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:90%
we are in the unknown.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:84%
When you are taking
your attention

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:84%
off the known, off the particle,
and putting it on the unknown,

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:90%
you're putting it on the 99.9--

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On the
field of potential.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You
are in that field.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're ready to
carve out a new reality.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So second point is
that, absolutely, we've

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:90%
been conditioned.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:84%
This is so unfortunate,
that so many people

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:84%
think that beauty has
to look a certain way,

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:84%
like an anemic, emaciated,
underweight, battered person

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:90%
that looks very unhappy.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And don't you know that you
will never arrive there?

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And so people have an
image in their mind

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:90%
of how they should look.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And they will never
arrive at that,

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.350 align:middle line:84%
but that's what will
keep them consuming.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the lack that
they feel in the ideal

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to reach
will never be fulfilled,

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.530 align:middle line:84%
so they'll keep consuming,
because they believe

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
that change happens
outside of them.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.830 align:middle line:90%
True change happens from within.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin to remove some
of those layers and masks that

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:84%
block the flow of the divine
in us, when we start overcoming

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.390 align:middle line:84%
ourselves in certain
ways, the intelligence

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that's giving us life
begins to come out of us.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.714 align:middle line:84%
That's when we start
to feel joyful.

00:20:20.714 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it's, we're
happy for no reason,

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's
happening from within.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.036 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
kind of a conundrum

00:20:27.036 --> 00:20:30.320 align:middle line:84%
there, too, because you
have women and men-- I mean,

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:84%
there are men having
various implants

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.550 align:middle line:84%
in their calves
and other places.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now it's affected all
of us in the Western world.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.430 align:middle line:90%
And in the Asian world as well.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I remember going
over there and seeing

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:84%
billboards for skin
whitening, and girls

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:84%
with white, white faces, and
beautiful, nice, dark bodies,

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.010 align:middle line:84%
but white faces, because
of the perception

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:90%
that white was more desirable.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't matter.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.280 align:middle line:90%
It's around the planet.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you're not is
what you think you should be.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So we have a double
problem here.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
In this kind of
self-loathing, there's

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
the problem of breaking
the trance of what

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:84%
is beauty, what is the
notion of beauty, which

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
is highly individual
and generated

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:90%
from the inside, first of all.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.801 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's no different
than that Bernays thing

00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:18.300 align:middle line:90%
we just saw.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:90%
It's the same exact thing.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.995 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's still
the same conditioning.

00:21:21.995 --> 00:21:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same conditioning.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But instead what
you'll have is someone

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.787 align:middle line:84%
maybe listening to you right now
and saying, OK, I can do this.

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:28.370 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.080 align:middle line:90%
I want to be 112 pounds.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.520 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.157 align:middle line:84%
But still, it's buying
into that exact thing.

00:21:35.157 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:90%
But again, let's examine this.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fundamentally
important for people

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:90%
to realize.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:84%
When you're getting
beyond your identity,

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and you become a
though and possibility,

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:84%
something amazing happens
over and over again.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.036 align:middle line:84%
We've measured it
on so many people.

00:21:55.036 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
When you're living by the
hormones of stress, fear,

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.660 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, worry, anger,
aggression, hostility,

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:84%
judgment, envy, and insecurity,
jealousy, hopelessness,

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:84%
powerlessness,
depression, guilt, shame--

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.630 align:middle line:84%
those are all created by
the hormones of stress.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Psychology calls those normal
states of consciousness.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Those are altered
states of consciousness.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.016 align:middle line:84%
When we live by those
emotional states consistently,

00:22:17.016 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and the brain is being
driven by those hormones,

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:90%
the brain is in high emergency.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's in a very
high brainwave pattern.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And in that high
brainwave pattern,

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:84%
that hyper-aroused state, you
will not take your attention

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:90%
off the outer world.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the innate
mechanisms say

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.235 align:middle line:84%
that there's a predator
around the corner.

00:22:36.235 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:84%
There's danger
out there, and you

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:84%
don't want to take
your attention

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.563 align:middle line:84%
off the outer environment,
and why would you

00:22:40.563 --> 00:22:42.060 align:middle line:90%
want to go in and create?

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
You believe the outer world is
more real than the inner world.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And because your attention
is going from your problems,

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:84%
to your relationship, to your
Facebook, to your Twitter,

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:84%
to your kids, to your
car, to your face,

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to your weight, your
attention is fragmented.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look at
how the brain begins

00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:59.324 align:middle line:90%
to compartmentalize--

00:22:59.324 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
pictures of it.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: --the
hormones of stress

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:84%
create very incoherent, very
arrhythmic brainwave patterns.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
That incoherence
over time begins

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.055 align:middle line:84%
to create a very
incoherent signal

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
down the central nervous system,
which controls and coordinates

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.950 align:middle line:84%
all those systems, and the
body moves out of balance.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the moment you
begin to open your focus,

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.492 align:middle line:84%
and the moment you begin to
become nobody, no one, nothing,

00:23:21.492 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:84%
nowhere, and no time-- I've
seen this over and over again--

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.720 align:middle line:90%
you become consciousness.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.420 align:middle line:90%
A thought in possibility.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:84%
The moment that happens,
the identity is gone.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And the brain says, thank
god he's out of the way.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank god she's out of the way.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, those
different compartments that

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:84%
were no longer
talking to each other,

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:84%
they start to reach out and
connect with one another,

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.280 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
survival mode anymore.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in survival,
you gotta take care of yourself.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Compartments of
the brain say, hey,

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.270 align:middle line:84%
this isn't the time
to communicate.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.540 align:middle line:90%
This is a time to be selfish.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.820 align:middle line:84%
But when you begin
to open your focus,

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.630 align:middle line:84%
the brain begins to start
to get highly organized.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.466 align:middle line:84%
Very integrated
and very coherent.

00:23:59.466 --> 00:24:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And different
compartments of the brain

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.990 align:middle line:90%
start talking to each other.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.860 align:middle line:84%
We call that a
whole brain state.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.980 align:middle line:84%
The front of the brain
starts talking to the back.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:84%
The right side of the brain
starts talking with the left,

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and you see this kind of
psychic union going on.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
around at the person

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
while they're doing that,
this is what you see.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
You see the person not
wanting the moment to end.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
They are so connected to
something greater that they're

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:84%
trusting in their
future in that moment.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Now I call that the
natural state of being.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And we get to this
point where we

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:84%
feel connected when we're
more energy and less matter.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:84%
We're more wave
and less particle.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And we feel connected
to a future.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurs,
the field around the body

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.540 align:middle line:90%
begins to get very large.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.470 align:middle line:90%
How do I know?

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:42.640 align:middle line:90%
I measured it.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So now, the person gets
into that whole state,

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:51.640 align:middle line:84%
they are no longer
seduced by the things

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:90%
in their external environment.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
more whole you feel,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:90%
the less pleasure you seek.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:84%
The less whole you feel,
the more pleasure you seek.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning
stages when we were first

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:84%
doing the measurements and I
was watching this one woman,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I was watching her
brain, and I was

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.552 align:middle line:84%
watching it get worse
during the meditation.

00:25:11.552 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And I kept watching,
and I kept watching,

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:13.840 align:middle line:90%
and it kept getting worse.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.256 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the
meditation ended,

00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:17.680 align:middle line:84%
and I called her into the
room with me on a break.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what was
going on in there?

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I was
analyzing my life.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
The moment she said
that, I understood.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.170 align:middle line:84%
If we analyze our life within
the emotion that's driving us,

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.870 align:middle line:84%
the answer will never be
in that emotional state,

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:84%
because the emotion is
the record of the past.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.380 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking in
the box of the past.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.159 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You take
people, and you get them

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:84%
beyond their emotions,
they will look back,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:90%
and they'll have the answer.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't answer questions
anymore in my workshops,

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.181 align:middle line:84%
because I know that
if a person's going

00:25:49.181 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
through something,
they're not going

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:84%
to hear anything
I say that isn't

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:90%
equal to their emotional state.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.989 align:middle line:84%
Change their emotional
state, and not only

00:25:55.989 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:84%
do they have their own
realization of self,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.140 align:middle line:84%
but more information
makes it in.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So in high beta, when you're
aroused and you're stressed,

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.650 align:middle line:90%
it's not a time to learn.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:90%
It's time to react.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.004 align:middle line:84%
It's not a time for
growth, and creation,

00:26:08.004 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and long-term building
projects, and trusting.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
reactionary period.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: It's not a
time to trust the unknown.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a time to brace
yourself for the unknown,

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.850 align:middle line:84%
because the unknown usually
means something dangerous.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So then, we have to
lay down the very thing

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.300 align:middle line:84%
we used our whole life to get
what we want for something

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%
greater to occur.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Now that is a skill.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Because our students over time
can change their brainwave

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:84%
states in a very
short amount of time,

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:84%
because they've
practiced doing it.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Once they are able to get beyond
their analytical mind, what

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:84%
separates the conscious mind
from the subconscious mind

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:90%
is the analytical mind.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So in order for us to program,
reprogram, the subconscious,

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:90%
we've got to thinking.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you're analyzing your
life while you're meditating,

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:84%
you might as well
open your eyes,

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
because your brainwave
patterns, you're

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:84%
not accessing the
subconscious system.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen over and over
again that we can teach that.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And people can get
really good at it.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.445 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't depend-- it has no
function of how old you are,

00:27:06.445 --> 00:27:07.750 align:middle line:90%
or what your background is.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.869 align:middle line:90%
It's just a skill.

00:27:08.869 --> 00:27:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:90%
So I have a question here.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:11.602 align:middle line:90%
So people come in.

00:27:11.602 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:84%
There are usually very specific
things they are focused on,

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.940 align:middle line:84%
specific things they'd like
to reverse or transform.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Is it enough, if you
can get to that place

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
where you're in that
lovely state of meditation,

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.580 align:middle line:84%
where you're in that void,
and you don't want to go home,

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.790 align:middle line:84%
you want to stay where
you are, and you're

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.820 align:middle line:84%
feeling that kind
of eternal bliss

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.060 align:middle line:84%
that we're bathed in all the
time, just not dialed into.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Is that enough to create
the transformation,

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.660 align:middle line:84%
or do they have to actually
apply it to a specific thing

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:84%
they're working on, and
revision it, so to speak.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: The answer's both.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.810 align:middle line:84%
There's so many times-- and this
has happened to me in my life

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.810 align:middle line:84%
many times, and we've seen
it with a lot of students.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Wholeness is the perfect
place to create from.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But you and I think that
creation is an effort.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.770 align:middle line:90%
It's actually not.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a delicate
balance between intention

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.430 align:middle line:90%
and surrender.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.261 align:middle line:84%
If you over-intend,
that's trying.

00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And we've all done that.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:08.926 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:08.926 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.530 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.620 align:middle line:84%
The brain is clamped
down and tight.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:11.895 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:28:11.895 --> 00:28:12.603 align:middle line:90%
It's not working.

00:28:12.603 --> 00:28:14.715 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
over-surrender, you're lazy,

00:28:14.715 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and you're lethargic,
and you're uninspired.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you really get
clear on what you want,

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and you've created, and then
you surrender, and you relax,

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and you trust in the outcome,
it's a very delicate thing

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:90%
that we can only talk around.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to explain.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:90%
So in a sense, yes.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.740 align:middle line:84%
In a state of wholeness, all
the things that you thought

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.030 align:middle line:90%
you wanted, you no longer want.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.332 align:middle line:84%
Because how could you
want when you feel whole?

00:28:41.332 --> 00:28:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're blissed out.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.465 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: There's
nothing to want.

00:28:43.465 --> 00:28:44.530 align:middle line:90%
You're whole.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.950 align:middle line:90%
So think about this.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Most people, they say,
oh, I want wealth.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:50.913 align:middle line:84%
But really, what
they want is freedom.

00:28:50.913 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:84%
They want to be able to
do whatever they want,

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.620 align:middle line:90%
whenever they want.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:53.988 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They want
to bring whatever

00:28:53.988 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:90%
the wealth would bring them.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But they want the
emotion of freedom.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: So we
say to our students,

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.510 align:middle line:84%
well, if you want
freedom from wealth,

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.174 align:middle line:90%
why don't you just feel free?

00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
you're really after.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So then you can condition the
body into a state of freedom.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally, when a
person is whole, and relaxed,

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and satisfied with himself
in the present moment,

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time connected
to a vision in the future,

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.200 align:middle line:90%
that's when it always happens.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
We've seen it over
and over again.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.430 align:middle line:90%
So it's that delicate balance.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not too much yin.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not too much yang.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the combination
between the two.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, what people
really want is inner joy.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.750 align:middle line:90%
What they want is inner peace.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
in the work, you

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.450 align:middle line:84%
think about all these things
in the veneer, like the sports

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.820 align:middle line:84%
car, or the boat, or the
relationship, or the whatever.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.920 align:middle line:90%
The material things.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.470 align:middle line:84%
But as you start realizing
that you're making changes,

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling
happier from within,

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:84%
you're less interested
in that external stuff.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean me, personally, I
love the mystical moment.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I love the moments
that rock my world,

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:84%
where I can't go back
to business as usual.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And there are people in
our work, when I tell you,

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:84%
they have had some very
unusual experiences.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you one right now.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I talk about
this woman in the book.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I was just in Australia
a few days ago.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And last time I was
there last year,

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.930 align:middle line:84%
we were doing this meditation
where we open our focus,

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and we become nobody, no one,
no thing, nowhere and no time,

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to begin to invest your
energy in the unknown.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And the longer you
linger in the unknown,

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.810 align:middle line:84%
the more you create
opportunity in your life.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you, as the
quantum observer,

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:39.050 align:middle line:84%
keep focusing on the known, the
material, people, and things,

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and places in your external
life, your body, your face,

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.010 align:middle line:84%
your emotions, the predictable
future, the memory of the past,

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:84%
then you keep
focusing on the known,

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and you will keep investing
your energy into the known,

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and you'll keep
creating the known.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So she slipped into
this beautiful place.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching
her in the audience.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.380 align:middle line:90%
It was a big audience in Sydney.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I kind of leaned over.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And with her eyes
closed, I went like this.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And with her eyes closed, she
went, oh, and she waved at me.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And I had two trainers
sitting on the opposite side

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.909 align:middle line:84%
of the room, and I
called them over.

00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And I went like
this, I went over,

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and she was waving
about 30 feet away.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And I pointed like that.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.666 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I pointed
at her, she went like this.

00:31:22.666 --> 00:31:23.910 align:middle line:90%
She waved over here.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.870 align:middle line:90%
She waved over there.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:25.911 align:middle line:90%
And she waved over there.

00:31:25.911 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And my trainer said,
what is going on?

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, you focus on the
unknown, you get the unknown.

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.692 align:middle line:84%
So then we had a more
progressive workshop

00:31:34.692 --> 00:31:36.150 align:middle line:84%
in Melbourne the
following weekend.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:36.790 align:middle line:90%
She came again.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.235 align:middle line:90%
She was in the way back.

00:31:38.235 --> 00:31:40.360 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of the
meditations, I'd go like this,

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and then she would wave from
the back with her eyes closed.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:44.380 align:middle line:90%
She was seeing.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She was in the field.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.486 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: She was
seeing without eyes.

00:31:46.486 --> 00:31:48.470 align:middle line:90%
The brain sees, not the eyes.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So she was selected as
one of our trainers,

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and she came to the
Pacific Northwest,

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and we train our trainers
for six days, 12 hours a day.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day,
we review all the content

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that they learn in about
a 15-20 minute meditation.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And while she was
in that meditation,

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.510 align:middle line:90%
she was going like this.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.900 align:middle line:84%
She kept looking behind her,
seeing one of the staff.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.483 align:middle line:84%
And I knew exactly
what was happening.

00:32:10.483 --> 00:32:12.810 align:middle line:84%
She was seeing 360
degrees, and she

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.280 align:middle line:84%
was in the habit of
opening her eyes to see.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, it gets weird,
because Jeffrey Fannin,

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:19.790 align:middle line:84%
our neuroscientist,
was in town, and we

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
were measuring some
of the core functions.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let's
measure our trainers.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.856 align:middle line:84%
So we hook her up
to the brain scan,

00:32:26.856 --> 00:32:28.605 align:middle line:84%
and the computer's
over here, and her back

00:32:28.605 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:90%
is to us way over there.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And first, they do eyes open,
and then eyes open on task,

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.390 align:middle line:90%
then eyes closed.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.973 align:middle line:84%
And then, they move
into a meditation.

00:32:36.973 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:90%
They get some baselines.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So she does all the
different baseline processes,

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking at the
computer, and all of a sudden

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.090 align:middle line:84%
her visual cortex
just lights up,

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.774 align:middle line:90%
which means she's seeing, right?

00:32:49.774 --> 00:32:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.773 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And then her
frontal lobe lights up with it,

00:32:52.773 --> 00:32:55.110 align:middle line:84%
really intensely
with a lot of energy.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:middle line:90%
And Jeffrey says, oh, look.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:90%
She's visualizing.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.570 align:middle line:90%
She's visualizing.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:02.726 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, she's seeing.

00:33:02.726 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She's seeing.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: And he goes, what?

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And she has her back to
us, and I go like this.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.510 align:middle line:90%
And she goes.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, what is going on?

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] I love it.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And I said,
you focus on the unknown,

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:15.403 align:middle line:90%
you get the unknown.

00:33:15.403 --> 00:33:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was just in Melbourne
in Sydney this past week,

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.990 align:middle line:90%
and I put her into meditation.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And I had her move
around the room.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And I had one of my trainers
turn his cellphone on.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.454 align:middle line:84%
And she was so angry,
because with her eyes closed,

00:33:28.454 --> 00:33:29.370 align:middle line:90%
she saw the cellphone.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.969 align:middle line:90%
I wrote something on the board.

00:33:30.969 --> 00:33:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I wanted her to read
what was on the board.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is non-local.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.167 align:middle line:90%
She was in the field.

00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:84%
She was able to pick
up all that data.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the point.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:43.440 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go back to business
as usual after a few of those

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.150 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Can you?

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: I mean, her life
is never going to be the same.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:90%
And she's non-local.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.733 align:middle line:90%
She can go anywhere now.

00:33:51.733 --> 00:33:52.809 align:middle line:90%
She's in the field.

00:33:52.809 --> 00:33:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, that's taking
me into another part

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.990 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation I
wanted to talk to you about.

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And that has to
do-- I mean, you're

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.800 align:middle line:84%
talking about remote
viewing, essentially.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And we know that can be trained.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.449 align:middle line:84%
They even do it in the
military, and they've

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:10.810 align:middle line:84%
used these programs
for decades, of course.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you go alongside
that, we can also

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.510 align:middle line:84%
look at the subject
of remote healing.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
how our intention,

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:22.650 align:middle line:84%
our going into the
non-local field,

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and it can affect
the non-local field

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
of another for their
own spontaneous healing.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Sure.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Wow, this is a
great conversation.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:35.949 align:middle line:84%
In our work, I say
that all disease

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:90%
is a lowering of frequency.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:41.205 align:middle line:84%
And I say that all disease
is a lowering of frequency

00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and an incoherent
vibration of frequency.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So as the frequency
of matter slows down,

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.949 align:middle line:84%
it's more prone to the
laws of thermodynamics.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Primarily, the Second Law of
Thermodynamics is entropy.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Things tend to move
towards disorder.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.080 align:middle line:84%
They break down because
they're just matter.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So when we live by the
hormones of stress,

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and we're functioning primarily
in an incoherent state,

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.840 align:middle line:84%
it begins to, over time,
to entrain the body

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to begin to break down,
because we're more matter

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:90%
and less energy.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.036 align:middle line:84%
We're more particle
and less wave.

00:35:14.036 --> 00:35:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're pretty much going
to break down in time.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.074 align:middle line:90%
There's no energy, right?

00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So as an example,
you have a field

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.823 align:middle line:90%
of information around your body.

00:35:20.823 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:90%
How do we know that?

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Because the atom's
99.999% nothing.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But now, there's
a piece of matter

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that matter functions as, you
know, but it's very small,

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.840 align:middle line:90%
infinitesimal part.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.050 align:middle line:84%
But if you take two atoms
and you bring them together,

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:90%
you form a molecule.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.214 align:middle line:84%
And that molecule shares
a field of information.

00:35:42.214 --> 00:35:43.630 align:middle line:84%
That field of
information is where

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.010 align:middle line:90%
the electrons are interacting.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But the moment those
two atoms join,

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.680 align:middle line:84%
now they have
different properties.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.830 align:middle line:90%
They're a molecule.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep
adding more atoms,

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.130 align:middle line:84%
you keep creating
a bigger molecule,

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.550 align:middle line:90%
and it becomes a chemical.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And that chemical is sharing an
invisible field of information

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that's giving life to
the characteristics

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.637 align:middle line:84%
of that particular
atom-- I mean molecule.

00:36:04.637 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So then if you take chemicals,
and you put the chemicals

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.400 align:middle line:84%
together, you
create an organelle.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.608 align:middle line:84%
And if you take organelles
and you put them together,

00:36:10.608 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:90%
you've created a cell.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And a cell has an invisible
field of information

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that's instructing, and giving
consciousness, and energy,

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and information to allow
that cell to function.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So that cell is having
information communicated

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.920 align:middle line:84%
within it faster than
the speed of light.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So if it's happening faster
than the speed of light,

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:35.110 align:middle line:84%
this new field of information
biology and photons

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:39.640 align:middle line:84%
is saying that the cell is
connected to some field that's

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.950 align:middle line:84%
instructing all of
those things that's

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.280 align:middle line:84%
happening at 100,000
times per second.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not charges doing it.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.830 align:middle line:84%
There's an intelligence that's
organizing this whole thing.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you form cells
together, you create tissues.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Those tissues have a
field of information.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.870 align:middle line:84%
If you fold tissues on
themselves, you create organs.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.626 align:middle line:84%
And that organ has a
field of information.

00:36:58.626 --> 00:36:59.250 align:middle line:90%
How do we know?

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Because if a person has a liver
transplant and all of a sudden

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.000 align:middle line:84%
they love potato
chips, then that's

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:84%
because there's a field
of information that's

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.440 align:middle line:90%
contributing to their field.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.370 align:middle line:84%
If you take organs,
you create systems.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Musculoskeletal system,
digestive system,

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.260 align:middle line:84%
reproductive system,
cardiovascular system.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.930 align:middle line:84%
They share a field
of information.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And put those systems
together, you form a body.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And that body has a
field of information.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Now that field of
information is what

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:90%
is giving life to the body.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.800 align:middle line:90%
This is you and me.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.670 align:middle line:90%
This is the real true self.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: OK?

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Now let's just suppose you
react to your co-worker,

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.550 align:middle line:84%
you react to your ex-husband,
you react to bad news.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:39.540 align:middle line:84%
You think about a problem in
your life that makes you angry.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.570 align:middle line:84%
The moment you do
that, you are drawing

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.990 align:middle line:84%
from this field of energy,
and you're taking that energy,

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's beginning
to release adrenaline.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're turning that
energy into liquid chemicals.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.450 align:middle line:84%
The moment that
happens, your field

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:84%
goes from about this
wide to about this wide.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Because you consume the
energy to go ahead and begin

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.430 align:middle line:90%
to process it into chemistry.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you're in emergency, and
you've got to use that energy.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:08.790 align:middle line:84%
That's why the mother can lift
the car up with her daughter

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:11.080 align:middle line:84%
underneath, and
pull the car out.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't say, oh, my god,
I ate carbohydrates today,

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.650 align:middle line:84%
or I haven't worked
out in two weeks.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:17.990 align:middle line:90%
She changes her energy, right?

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.170 align:middle line:90%
So that's energy that does that.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.041 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep mobilizing
all this energy,

00:38:23.041 --> 00:38:24.540 align:middle line:84%
you keep drawing
from the field, you

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.120 align:middle line:90%
have no field of information.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So now, matter begins
to become incoherent

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and begins to break down.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So then, when you begin
to elevate your energy,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.140 align:middle line:84%
not only just elevate
your energy, but coherent,

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.960 align:middle line:84%
organized energy--
when we know this,

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.330 align:middle line:84%
that when you have an
incoherent message, like a group

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.170 align:middle line:84%
of drummers playing
all at the same time,

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.586 align:middle line:84%
and they're out
of rhythm, and you

00:38:46.586 --> 00:38:48.003 align:middle line:84%
get four great
drummers coming in,

00:38:48.003 --> 00:38:49.752 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if there's
a thousand people.

00:38:49.752 --> 00:38:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Within a very short amount of
time, everybody's got rhythm.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.210 align:middle line:90%
That's called coherence.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.370 align:middle line:84%
The brain works
exactly the same.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's that coherent
signature that

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.970 align:middle line:84%
begins to entrain
incoherent signature.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:06.677 align:middle line:84%
In other words, coherence begins
to create order in disorder.

00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's called healing.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We could say that matter
is lifted to a new mind,

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.550 align:middle line:84%
whereas that energy
slows down, it

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.580 align:middle line:84%
begins to create more
orderliness and matter.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So we do a lot of
work with coherence

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.360 align:middle line:84%
in blessing different
centers of the body

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to create coherent
fields around them.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And we've had people
heal themselves

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:28.820 align:middle line:84%
of food allergies, and bladder
disease, and thyroid cancers,

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and brain tumors, and
all kinds of things,

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.990 align:middle line:84%
because they're creating a
coherent message in the field,

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:37.800 align:middle line:84%
so that matter can draw from
a new field of information,

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.750 align:middle line:84%
because there's
information there.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So then if you're able to
say, here's an example.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.610 align:middle line:84%
We had a lady that had really
bad food sensitivities.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:48.210 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't eat anything.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And she did a
particular meditation

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and blessed her one
particular center.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And in a very short amount
of time in a workshop,

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.310 align:middle line:84%
she was eating
everything she wanted

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.643 align:middle line:90%
to eat that she could never eat.

00:39:57.643 --> 00:40:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, we do meditations where
we also heal other people.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So if I created a coherent
signature in my field

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that took away my
food sensitivities,

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and a person laying
down-- coincidentally,

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:15.870 align:middle line:84%
this woman that she was about
to heal was living in India,

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:19.140 align:middle line:84%
got a bacterial infection,
and now all of a sudden

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.300 align:middle line:84%
had the same kind of
food sensitivities.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:25.290 align:middle line:84%
She said, I've healed myself
of food sensitivities.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:84%
This lady also has
food sensitivities.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.560 align:middle line:90%
She healed that lady.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And in one particular
healing, she was healed.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I had dinner with
both of these people.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And they were eating
whatever they wanted.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:39.190 align:middle line:84%
That was not the
case beforehand.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next question
is, if I've healed myself,

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and I'm able to heal
someone in front of me

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.770 align:middle line:84%
by creating coherent
signature, can I heal someone

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:51.370 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the planet?

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's see.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.340 align:middle line:84%
What piece of
knowledge could I apply

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.510 align:middle line:84%
to this model to
have the experience?

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, consciousness
is non-local.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.300 align:middle line:84%
If I get into that field
beyond space and time,

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I now know, because
of quantum physics,

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.060 align:middle line:84%
if we mingle two particles,
and you shoot them

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.100 align:middle line:84%
in opposite directions,
when you affect this one,

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.180 align:middle line:84%
this one is affected
faster than the speed

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.890 align:middle line:84%
of light, which means they're
affected beyond space and time.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I understand
that, I've healed myself,

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I've healed this
person, I should

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.360 align:middle line:84%
be able to do the same thing and
hold the image of that person,

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and be able to lay a coherent
signature into their field.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to
literally be there.

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum model
allows us to build

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.540 align:middle line:90%
greater understandings.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, I like to
think that when

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.770 align:middle line:84%
you have an experience of
your own personal healing,

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.230 align:middle line:84%
you're more prone to
believe in the next step.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:45.100 align:middle line:84%
If I healed myself, maybe
I can heal someone else.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.040 align:middle line:84%
If you're able to
heal that next person,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.373 align:middle line:84%
then you should be able to
say, god, I've healed myself,

00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:50.460 align:middle line:90%
I healed the next person.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Do I really need to
physically be present?

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:52.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:54.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's the quantum model?

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Now I understand
consciousness is non-local,

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and I can take it
to the next level.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:58.741 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:58.741 --> 00:42:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in
the process of this,

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:84%
then, it would have to
be the same principle

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that the coherent field
that you're interjecting

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.910 align:middle line:84%
or co-mingling with
their field has

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:14.470 align:middle line:84%
to have a superior charge
to it of the person who

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:16.635 align:middle line:84%
is in the declining
or degenerating state.

00:42:16.635 --> 00:42:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: That's
a great point.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Your energy has to
be higher than them.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean energetically,
like a superiority thing.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it's the
strength and purity, whatever

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.820 align:middle line:84%
you want to call it, of
that love and intention.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: You
have to give thanks

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:34.540 align:middle line:90%
in a state of absolute divinity.

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.519 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: In order
to emulate the divine,

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:38.510 align:middle line:90%
you have to be divine.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:41.290 align:middle line:84%
In order to emulate the creator,
you have to be a creator.

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.360 align:middle line:84%
In order for you to create
something unlimited,

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.250 align:middle line:90%
you have to feel unlimited.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to open
your focus because you have

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.700 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the
field, and then you

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.530 align:middle line:84%
begin to lay information
into that person's body,

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.970 align:middle line:84%
you can't hope, you can't
wish, you can't pray,

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:00.480 align:middle line:84%
you can't feel bad for
them, you can't feel guilty,

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.910 align:middle line:90%
you can't feel sorry for them.

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:05.760 align:middle line:84%
You literally have to be in a
whole 'nother state of being.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
divine aspect of us.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.100 align:middle line:84%
When we perform our
miracles, we always say,

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.865 align:middle line:84%
it was the power
within me that did it.

00:43:12.865 --> 00:43:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we don't
perform our miracles,

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:18.397 align:middle line:84%
we say, wow, I was my
limited human emotional self.

00:43:18.397 --> 00:43:19.730 align:middle line:90%
I think making that transition--

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.680 align:middle line:84%
You made something clear
for me, because I've

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.750 align:middle line:84%
been involved with
remote healing for years.

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:90%
But I noticed something.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.760 align:middle line:84%
When it's an emergency,
where something

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:84%
has to be reacted to on
my part very quickly,

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.390 align:middle line:84%
someone needs help
immediately, pure, clean, boom.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anything can be
overturned with that.

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.860 align:middle line:84%
But if it's something
where I have a chance

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.007 align:middle line:90%
to mull it over and think, ah--

00:43:44.007 --> 00:43:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Analyze.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Analyze.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:46.255 align:middle line:90%
It's degenerative.

00:43:46.255 --> 00:43:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't know.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I find that the
muddiness of my own

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.490 align:middle line:84%
thought having intruded
upon it might not

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:54.840 align:middle line:90%
get the same effect at all.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Exactly.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So when it happens
immediately, when

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.040 align:middle line:84%
you're presented with a
situation immediately,

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, boom, you're able
to just move in and move

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.840 align:middle line:90%
into that state very quickly.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.044 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when Jesus
perform his miracles,

00:44:08.044 --> 00:44:09.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, when he
pulled them off,

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.830 align:middle line:84%
he said, I was the
Son of God today.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.330 align:middle line:84%
When he didn't
perform his miracles,

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.100 align:middle line:84%
he said, I was the
Son of Man today.

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.290 align:middle line:90%
I was my human, emotional self.

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's making that switch,
then, is what it's about.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I love the idea
of remote healing

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:25.477 align:middle line:90%
because it's a bigger model.

00:44:25.477 --> 00:44:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do, too.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: But we have to
build that model in order for us

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.259 align:middle line:84%
to reach a certain
level of acceptance.

00:44:31.259 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.690 align:middle line:84%
When I talked to you last
time you were here in Boulder,

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:37.740 align:middle line:84%
we were just saying
goodbye, and we said,

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, next time we
get together, we

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.390 align:middle line:90%
need to talk about this thing.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And it was-- I wrote it down.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.660 align:middle line:84%
It was about the courting
of our non-linear selves

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.700 align:middle line:90%
in space-time.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Oh, god.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.890 align:middle line:90%
You wanna talk about that?

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Otherwise, we
have two directions to go.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.480 align:middle line:84%
One of them is kind
of more very grounded.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a little on
the darker side.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Talking about what
happens when we

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:03.980 align:middle line:84%
have this overly reactive,
addictive, neurochemical

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.330 align:middle line:84%
program going on, and how
that affects our society,

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and the allowance of
things like drones.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And we can go that
direction, or we

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.135 align:middle line:84%
can go into this
non-linear self.

00:45:13.135 --> 00:45:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: OK.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.135 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about space
and time and time and space,

00:45:16.135 --> 00:45:19.650 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very
interesting phenomenon.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:22.680 align:middle line:84%
In this dimension
where we live, where

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.290 align:middle line:84%
there is an abundance of space--
I mean, space goes on forever.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And because space goes on
forever, we have dimension.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So in order for us
to experience time,

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.030 align:middle line:90%
we have to move through space.

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm going to get up from
here and go to the restroom,

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.080 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take me a certain
amount of time to get there.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.980 align:middle line:84%
The faster I move, the
shorter the time there is.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So in order for us
to experience time,

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.850 align:middle line:90%
we have to move through space.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.959 align:middle line:84%
And for the most part,
that's how we create things

00:45:51.959 --> 00:45:53.000 align:middle line:90%
that we want in our life.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:84%
We set goals, we
get our behaviors

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.940 align:middle line:84%
to match our intentions,
we learn from our mistakes,

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.910 align:middle line:84%
we modify our behaviors,
and we keep going.

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:03.135 align:middle line:84%
When you truly slip
into this quantum place,

00:46:03.135 --> 00:46:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and we do this in
some of our workshops,

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:08.110 align:middle line:84%
there's an inverse
phenomenon that happens.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:11.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you're
truly in the present moment,

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Regina, that's the
moment time is eternal.

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Now the way that we
experience that realm

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:22.580 align:middle line:84%
is that when you
move through time,

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.560 align:middle line:90%
you experience different space.

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.427 align:middle line:84%
So you would think that-- I
know this is very abstract.

00:46:28.427 --> 00:46:31.010 align:middle line:84%
But you would think that there
is a past life, a present life,

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:32.060 align:middle line:90%
and a future life.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's how it
looks from down here.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.910 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to
this place, they're

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.660 align:middle line:84%
all stacked on
top of each other.

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.670 align:middle line:84%
All of these realities
are happening all at once,

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.230 align:middle line:90%
because time is abundant.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So then, as you begin to
change your vibration,

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:51.400 align:middle line:84%
you change your energy,
you change your frequency,

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.500 align:middle line:84%
as you slow or speed
up your frequency,

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.440 align:middle line:84%
you can experience
another aspect

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.300 align:middle line:84%
in space, another
reality that you're

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.620 align:middle line:90%
living in simultaneously.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And people in our
work, we do this work.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
one of those moments,

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.960 align:middle line:84%
you can look across the
table and look at somebody

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and understand that
they are absolutely

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:12.610 align:middle line:90%
not that body they're wearing.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:16.200 align:middle line:84%
That you know them from
another place and another time.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
mysticism begins

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.900 align:middle line:90%
to really get interesting.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I've had some amazing
moments in this other realm.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And as I've said earlier, you
cannot go back to business

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:28.500 align:middle line:90%
as usual.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.820 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a change
in neurochemistry.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.430 align:middle line:84%
It takes getting a little
further than you typically

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.930 align:middle line:90%
like to go.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And you really have
to disassociate.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:39.017 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of a wild ride.

00:47:39.017 --> 00:47:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are we talking about
anything as simple as, perhaps,

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.030 align:middle line:84%
beginning with just
moving into what

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:47.460 align:middle line:84%
is perceived as-- I know
time and space isn't linear,

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.740 align:middle line:84%
but as perceived as a
past life experience,

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.890 align:middle line:90%
and reliving it fully.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.756 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because when
you go in that, I mean,

00:47:53.756 --> 00:47:56.110 align:middle line:84%
the chemicals are the same
as what happens in this time.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:56.859 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Right.

00:47:56.859 --> 00:47:59.809 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment, you wouldn't
perceive it as a past life.

00:47:59.809 --> 00:48:01.350 align:middle line:84%
You would perceive
it as a now life--

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just an
alternate reality.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: An
alternate reality that's

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:04.740 align:middle line:84%
stacked right on top
of the other one.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.531 align:middle line:84%
And all of it's happening
at the same time,

00:48:06.531 --> 00:48:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and you see this cord
of your personality,

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.770 align:middle line:84%
of your identity, of your soul,
moving through all of these.

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that
experience in that place,

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.720 align:middle line:84%
the only way I can
describe it is you

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.340 align:middle line:84%
understand who you are
in this now better.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think the biggest
lie that we've ever

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.385 align:middle line:84%
been told and been
conditioned into believing

00:48:25.385 --> 00:48:28.800 align:middle line:84%
is that we're linear
beings living linear life.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:32.200 align:middle line:84%
We are multi-dimensional
beings living

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.670 align:middle line:90%
a multi-dimensional life.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:39.247 align:middle line:84%
And once that little
blip gets out,

00:48:39.247 --> 00:48:41.330 align:middle line:84%
people are going to start
becoming very empowered.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Because this is only a
very small slice of what

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.590 align:middle line:90%
we can experience.

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutey.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's stay on this
theme for just a moment,

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.920 align:middle line:84%
though, for people who have
been interested in exploring

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.710 align:middle line:90%
the notion of past lives.

00:48:54.710 --> 00:49:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, if we are going
into these spaces of fullness,

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and bliss, and awareness, total
awareness and nothingness,

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and we choose to take a look at
something that may be playing

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:15.220 align:middle line:84%
out in this time, how would
you reference that or frame it?

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.050 align:middle line:90%
What would you say to yourself?

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.446 align:middle line:84%
Can you show me a reality
I may have experienced?

00:49:19.446 --> 00:49:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Oh, how
do you unfold that?

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you
unfold that languaging,

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:25.930 align:middle line:84%
so you're not necessarily
anchoring it into the past.

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:27.695 align:middle line:90%
Because it's still useful.

00:49:27.695 --> 00:49:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Even if you call it a past
life, it's still useful.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.500 align:middle line:90%
You still go in there.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, we do
that work in our workshops.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:37.560 align:middle line:84%
It takes about two or three
days to prepare the brain

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.630 align:middle line:90%
and body to get there.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.280 align:middle line:90%
But it's coordinates.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a coordinate.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Just like you're
thinking about going

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:45.761 align:middle line:90%
from Boulder to Los Angeles.

00:49:45.761 --> 00:49:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But can't your
intention set the coordinate?

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:49.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to see whatever
has programmed this.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Absolutely.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:50.240 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.350 align:middle line:84%
But you'll never get
what you expect to get.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:53.320 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:54.170 align:middle line:90%
I've been through a lot of it.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, so that's
the cool part about it.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a wild ride.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.898 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:49:56.898 --> 00:49:57.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a wild ride.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so there's
techniques that we use.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.700 align:middle line:84%
But really, what I want
to say about all of this

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:08.340 align:middle line:84%
is that the beauty behind
this interdimensional moment

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.370 align:middle line:84%
is that you have a
greater understanding

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:12.570 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery of self.

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, you're
not so prone to be

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:18.400 align:middle line:84%
so upset about the person who
cuts you off on the freeway,

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.979 align:middle line:84%
or the coworker that's talking
about you behind-- you've

00:50:20.979 --> 00:50:22.270 align:middle line:90%
just been in another dimension.

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:24.610 align:middle line:90%
You think you would really care.

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:26.716 align:middle line:90%
You belong somewhere else.

00:50:26.716 --> 00:50:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, it begins to create
a lot of speculation of,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.180 align:middle line:84%
is there a future Regina
that is already enlightened?

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.490 align:middle line:84%
That is already
mastering-- has mastered

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:41.150 align:middle line:84%
herself, that can talk
to the Regina who's

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:42.990 align:middle line:90%
sitting here right now?

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:44.670 align:middle line:90%
And can you co-mingle that?

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And then, is
this Regina now connected

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:49.040 align:middle line:90%
to that future?

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And can that future
send a signal to now?

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just gets
very, very interesting.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:57.140 align:middle line:84%
As in the past, you
can go forward as well.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah, exactly.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.068 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As it's non-linear.

00:50:59.068 --> 00:50:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:00.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So as we're starting
to wind down on time

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.630 align:middle line:84%
here, although it just seems
like a blink of an eye,

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk a little
bit about the meditation

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:10.757 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the book,
why you structured it

00:51:10.757 --> 00:51:13.130 align:middle line:84%
the way you did
in terms of space.

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Just the space portion of
it, and why-- you have it

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:19.970 align:middle line:84%
on your site, so a
person can go to the site

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and download a
guided meditation.

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:24.212 align:middle line:84%
The same meditation
that's in here.

00:51:24.212 --> 00:51:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: Yeah.

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.044 align:middle line:84%
So the first half of the
book is about the science

00:51:28.044 --> 00:51:28.960 align:middle line:90%
and the understanding.

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:29.700 align:middle line:90%
The information.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.880 align:middle line:84%
The second half of the book
is about transformation.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:36.079 align:middle line:84%
So we have two meditations
that, either one of these,

00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:37.620 align:middle line:84%
you can work, and
it's about changing

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.800 align:middle line:84%
one belief or
perception, or changing

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.930 align:middle line:90%
two beliefs and perception.

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:44.200 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do a 45 minute
meditation, you can change one.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.470 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do an hour
meditation, you can change two.

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:48.720 align:middle line:90%
But they're available.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.940 align:middle line:84%
We start our meditations
every single time

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:53.850 align:middle line:84%
with an open focus,
because we want

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:56.117 align:middle line:84%
a person to take their
attention off their body.

00:51:56.117 --> 00:51:57.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't want them to
focus on the material.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:59.700 align:middle line:84%
We want them to
open their focus.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And where you place
your attention

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:04.030 align:middle line:90%
is where you place your energy.

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And so as you begin
to open your focus,

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:08.662 align:middle line:84%
the brain gets coherent,
as we've talked about.

00:52:08.662 --> 00:52:10.870 align:middle line:84%
You're taking your attention
off matter, and objects,

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and things, and you're
putting it on that field.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking
and analyzing

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:17.040 align:middle line:84%
less, because you're
sensing and feeling.

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's when brainwaves start
to move from beta into alpha,

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:22.170 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately into theta.

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.294 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you move
into the operating system.

00:52:24.294 --> 00:52:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Now you're ready to change
your belief and perception,

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.952 align:middle line:84%
because you're in
the programming.

00:52:28.952 --> 00:52:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:31.618 align:middle line:84%
We just have a
couple minutes left.

00:52:31.618 --> 00:52:33.576 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've covered
so much, and then

00:52:33.576 --> 00:52:34.950 align:middle line:84%
we haven't covered
half of what--

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:37.380 align:middle line:84%
we could've done four
hours easily here today.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: Well, I want
to end with something

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:41.690 align:middle line:84%
that may be
practical for people.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:47.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a group of women
south of Los Angeles that

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.267 align:middle line:90%
were all clinically blind.

00:52:49.267 --> 00:52:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:50.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a good story.

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DISPENZA: And quickly,
when the scientists studied

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:57.000 align:middle line:84%
these Cambodian women, there
was 150 to 200 of them.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.260 align:middle line:84%
They found out that they
had almost perfect vision,

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.931 align:middle line:90%
but their brain wasn't seeing.

00:53:00.931 --> 00:53:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, when they
interviewed these women,

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.740 align:middle line:84%
they found that these
women were subjected

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:08.180 align:middle line:84%
to the Khmer Rouge, and
the Dictator Pot Pol.

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.085 align:middle line:84%
And these women saw
the brutal murder

00:53:11.085 --> 00:53:14.835 align:middle line:84%
of their children, of their
husbands, of their brothers,

00:53:14.835 --> 00:53:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and of all of their kin.

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And the experience branded
neurologically and emotionally,

00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:25.330 align:middle line:84%
causing them to move into
a different perception

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:26.087 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:53:26.087 --> 00:53:28.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the brain
didn't want to see any longer.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.540 align:middle line:84%
They cried 'til they no
longer wanted to see.

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So then, what have
we experienced

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:35.290 align:middle line:84%
in our life that
causes us to not

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:38.910 align:middle line:84%
want to see, to not want to
hear, to not want to feel?

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So then the experience
changed their biology.

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:46.550 align:middle line:10%
So in order for us to change
a belief or perception

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.960 align:middle line:10%
about ourself and
our life, that when

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.520 align:middle line:10%
we make a decision with
that level of intention,

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.600 align:middle line:10%
it carries an amplitude
of energy that's

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:58.110 align:middle line:10%
greater than the past
experience, that's the moment

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.130 align:middle line:10%
our biology responds
to a new mind.

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:02.030 align:middle line:10%
That's when we come out
of our resting state.

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:03.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the snake charmer

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:06.550 align:middle line:84%
who's handling the snake and
gets bit by the poisonous snake

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:09.150 align:middle line:84%
doesn't say, geez, I wonder
if I'm going to die today.

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:12.490 align:middle line:84%
The priest who moves into a
state of religious ecstasy

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:14.640 align:middle line:84%
in the Deep South
doesn't say, oh, I'm

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.630 align:middle line:84%
going to drink this
strict strychnine,

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and I wonder if I'm going
to get poisoned today.

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:20.330 align:middle line:84%
The mother who lifts the child
from under the car doesn't say,

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:22.850 align:middle line:84%
god, I wonder if I
worked out enough.

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:24.640 align:middle line:90%
The decision is final.

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's energy, then, that
is the epiphenomena of matter.

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we change our
energy, we change our life.

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amen.

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:34.474 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: [LAUGHING]

00:54:34.474 --> 00:54:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: You're welcome.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And because we, again,
have barely gotten started,

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.900 align:middle line:84%
hopefully in another few
months, you'll be back.

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DISPENZA: OK.

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:45.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: As always, never
enough time with Dr. Joe.

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:47.080 align:middle line:10%
And we'll be coming back again.

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.062 align:middle line:10%
I certainly-- I hope so anyway.

00:54:49.062 --> 00:54:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you'll
be doing yourself

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.394 align:middle line:84%
a big favorite to pick
up a copy of the book,

00:54:52.394 --> 00:54:54.685 align:middle line:84%
"You Are the Placebo
Effect," for the science

00:54:54.685 --> 00:54:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and for the valuable meditation
at the end of the book.

00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a template for
changing your life.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
