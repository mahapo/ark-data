>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of the
fastest disappearing practices

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:10%
in Western culture is sleep,
so sweet yet so far away

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:10%
for so many people.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.320 align:middle line:84%
But what is this
doing to our lives?

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:84%
What actually happens
when we sleep?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:84%
From crossing between worlds
to restoring our immune systems

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and neural networks,
sleep is one

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:84%
of the most important
practices of being human.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Kat Duff loves to sleep and
began a years-long project

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:84%
to document what
happens when we sleep,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:84%
which became the basis of
her book "The Secret Life

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:90%
of Sleep."

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:90%
And Kat's here with us today.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:90%
You love to sleep?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KAT DUFF: I do, Regina.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell me when
you became just fascinated

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.367 align:middle line:90%
with the subject of sleep.

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: You know, I'd loved to
sleep when I was a little girl.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.950 align:middle line:90%
It was my favorite time of day.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:10%
I loved going in my
room, shutting the door,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:10%
turning off the
light, and it felt

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:10%
like it was a huge world that
I got to go to in my sleep.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:10%
And then in the
morning, waking up.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:10%
OK, I've got to do this life.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.184 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And I
always wondered, how

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.870 align:middle line:90%
is it that sleep changes me?

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Because I would notice
that I'd feel changed.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I'd wake up in a
better mood usually.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I'd wake up remembering
things for the tests better

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
than when I has
studied the day before.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I would wake up
with a different feeling

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.047 align:middle line:84%
about a situation than
I'd had the night before.

00:01:46.047 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Something that had been
really upsetting the night

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.612 align:middle line:84%
before suddenly
wasn't so upsetting.

00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like, oh,
I can deal with that.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.368 align:middle line:84%
And you're lucky,
because there are

00:01:54.368 --> 00:01:57.289 align:middle line:84%
people who go to sleep at night
and dread the experience--

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --who have night
terrors and horrid dreams

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.314 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
we're going to talk

00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:84%
about all the guises of
sleep and what it looks like

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and how different
people experience it.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of things I wanted
to start off with here,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's really
a shame that it's

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.970 align:middle line:84%
such a common
phrase among people

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
in the Western world, which
is you snooze, you lose.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.425 align:middle line:84%
And so this is bringing about
a mindset for many people

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, god, I wish
I didn't have to sleep.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.565 align:middle line:90%
Sleep is such a waste of time.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could get by
on three or four hours.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.023 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people actually
are getting by on three or four

00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:90%
hours because they can't sleep.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But what is that doing
to us as a culture,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.575 align:middle line:90%
this you snooze, you lose?

00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: You snooze,
you lose, I take it

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:84%
back to Ben Franklin,
who used to say

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
that we sleep
enough in the grave.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
That Western and
especially American

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
tradition of that
Protestant work ethic

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that says sleep is
a waste of time,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.710 align:middle line:84%
we've got better
things to do, one

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
of the most difficult things
about that, of course,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.014 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't
function as well when

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:03.305 align:middle line:90%
we aren't getting enough sleep.

00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
We're more likely to
focus on the negative.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
We're more likely to create
conflicts, to be aggressive,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:84%
to be unwilling to
resolve conflicts.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a harder time
remembering things.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:90%
We have poor judgment.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.730 align:middle line:90%
We take risks we shouldn't take.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.530 align:middle line:84%
That kind of sums up our
culture in some ways.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It does
in a lot of ways.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It creates also a
lack of patience

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes irresponsible
behaviors and such.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.939 align:middle line:90%
Poor judgment.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Poor judgement.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: There are some people,
a very small percentage

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:84%
of the population, that is
actually genetically inclined

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:84%
to get by on three or
four hours of sleep.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But a lot more
people try to do it

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
than can actually
get away with it.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.758 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And one of
the first things

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:84%
we lose when we're
sleep deprived

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
is our ability to reflect
on our own behavior.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So when someone tells me I
do just fine on three or four

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.292 align:middle line:84%
hours, I like to go to their
family members and ask them--

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
how are they doing?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: --how patient are they?

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Or to their coworkers.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Are they making many mistakes?

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.504 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't realize when
we are not functioning as well.

00:04:06.504 --> 00:04:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:90%
That becomes our reality.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I noticed when
I was in India, for example,

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
such a completely
different idea about sleep.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:84%
At first, it was
kind of shocking,

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
in that I saw people
sleeping kind of everywhere,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the road.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
walking into a cafe,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and I walked around the uncle
who was sleeping on the floor

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:84%
next to a plate of tomatoes
that had been cooked

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and were settling down, the
juices were settling down,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:90%
a big plate.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was just passed out
next to them on the floor,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and you just walked
around the uncle

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:90%
and went on about your business.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And sleep is really not
anything to be ashamed of

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.229 align:middle line:84%
but should be done whenever
you're inspired to do so.

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I was really interested in
the historical perspectives

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
on sleep and
cross-cultural ones.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
We have really, in our
westernized cultures,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
really privatized sleep
in the modern age.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Now before the Industrial
Age, before the advent

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
of artificial light, people
slept more communally.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:84%
They often slept twice
a day or twice a night.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But now we have
this habit where we

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:84%
think that we have to
go off by ourselves

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.102 align:middle line:84%
and have very special
conditions to sleep in.

00:05:21.102 --> 00:05:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do it
in one concentrated--

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: In one spell.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.613 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Right.

00:05:24.613 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm hmm.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So now a little bit
about your background.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.541 align:middle line:84%
You were involved for many years
in the study of neuroscience

00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:31.530 align:middle line:90%
and neurofeedback.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Mm hmm.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.718 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm
going to bring up

00:05:33.718 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:90%
the subject of Eugene Asbrinsky.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:90%
I think that's how you--

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Oh, yes.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about how your
background in neurofeedback

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
fed into the research and
understanding of sleep.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.418 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: I'd actually started
studying neurosciences

00:05:48.418 --> 00:05:50.626 align:middle line:84%
long before that, before
the neurofeedback, actually,

00:05:50.626 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:84%
with the-- I worked with
a lot of trauma survivors.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And of course there's a
very neurological component

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.010 align:middle line:90%
to post-traumatic stress.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:90%
So I started studying that then.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And also, as a
counselor we learn a lot

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.710 align:middle line:84%
about neurological
development in infancy

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and the conditions
of infancy that

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:90%
create later states of mind.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But then about 10 years
ago I got interested

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:84%
in neurofeedback, so I continued
that study of neurosciences.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And the relationship between
what's going on neurologically

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and how we think and how we feel
is really a fascinating one.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I learned
as a neurofeedback therapist

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:84%
especially is that no matter
what problem someone walks

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
in the door with, if we
can help them sleep better,

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.190 align:middle line:84%
usually that problem
gets better--

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.979 align:middle line:90%
So simple.

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: --whether it's
depression, anxiety,

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:90%
impulse control, all of those.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So I very quickly learned
to put into my intake,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.989 align:middle line:90%
how do you sleep?

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about your sleep.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.470 align:middle line:90%
How long do you sleep?

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:90%
How do you fall asleep?

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Those kinds of things are
very important to consider

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.580 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our mental
and emotional well-being.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then we
all know as time went on,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.902 align:middle line:90%
starting in 1953 with Asbrinsky?

00:07:05.902 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Aserinsky, yes.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Aserinsky?

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Mm hmm.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:84%
That's when we began
observing sleep.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And then over time sleep
labs started up and such.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
what that phenomena

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:90%
brought to our awareness?

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about in the
Western scientific tradition.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Until the development of our
brain imaging techniques,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
scientists in the West
assumed that nothing happened

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.315 align:middle line:84%
when we sleep, that our brains
were like the lamp next to us

00:07:33.315 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:84%
that we turn off
when we go to sleep

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and we turn it back
on when we wake up.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But then with the development
of the electroencephalogram

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:84%
we began to be able
to record brain waves.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And what Aserinsky did, he
brought his eight-year-old son

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:84%
into the sleep lab
and hooked him up

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and was watching
his brain waves.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And his son fell asleep
and started dreaming,

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and his eyes were flickering
around underneath their lids.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he realized--
The brain waves all

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:90%
got really intense.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he
realized, that he

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:84%
made the connection between
sleep and brain wave

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
activity and dreaming
and brain wave activity.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:84%
That put an end to the
notion that nothing

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:90%
happens while we sleep.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.937 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
Threshold Consciousness.

00:08:21.937 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:90%
You talk about that in the book.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.142 align:middle line:90%
What is Threshold Consciousness?

00:08:25.142 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: Well, we like
to think that we're

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
either awake or asleep and
there's no realm in between.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
But in fact what I've called
Threshold Consciousness

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.059 align:middle line:90%
is a blending of the two.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And neurological research has
confirmed that our brains just

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
don't shut down all at
once like a light bulb.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Different parts of
our brain, once they

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
get tired-- for
example, if we've

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.770 align:middle line:84%
been reading for a long time,
the parts of our brain we use

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:84%
when we're reading--
will, in a sense,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.110 align:middle line:84%
kind of close down for the
day before other parts.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we have these mixed
states of part awake,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
part asleep that manifests
in many different ways.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.170 align:middle line:90%
It can manifest as sleepwalking.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.715 align:middle line:84%
It can manifest as
sleep paralysis.

00:09:10.715 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
It can manifest
as creative ideas.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:84%
A lot of artists have mined
those threshold states

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.517 align:middle line:90%
for inspiration.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.837 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in a moment
we'll take a look

00:09:21.837 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:84%
at what that looks
like, sleepwalking.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.704 align:middle line:84%
It's a funny little video that
a man's family took of him,

00:09:26.704 --> 00:09:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and he's with his
little daughter.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:84%
But first, before we go
to that video in a sec,

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk about
that a little more,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
because that threshold area is
also where a lot of information

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
flows through for people
that tend to pay attention

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:90%
to intuitive impulses and such.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And in your book,
you talked about how

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Nabokov, the author of
"Lolita" and other books,

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
received a lot of
his information

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.745 align:middle line:84%
as he was drifting in
that between space.

00:09:53.745 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: Well, a lot of artists
have and a lot of writers,

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
Steinbeck who coined

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:90%
the phrase Committee of Sleep.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: I'll let my Committee
of Sleep work on this,

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'll have an idea in
the morning of what to do.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.791 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: It's very common.

00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I like to take my problems, both
in writing as well as my life

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:90%
problems, to my sleep.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I really
cherish those times

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
of falling asleep and
waking up, because that's

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.480 align:middle line:84%
when we can kind of access
the larger realms of awareness

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.645 align:middle line:84%
that we come to in sleep that
are hard to sometimes bring up

00:10:28.645 --> 00:10:29.697 align:middle line:90%
to conscious awareness.

00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And I notice in my own life I
have these very weird things

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:84%
that happen if I'm particularly
tired, for example.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.920 align:middle line:84%
You know how you've
been going, going?

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:90%
You're very tired.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
In those states, when I start
drifting into the sleep process

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not there yet,
I'm still conscious,

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:90%
I see full-on animated cartoons.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And I watch bizarre cartoons
and think, what is up?

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes see
almost a negative world

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.077 align:middle line:84%
of shadows of real
people, and I almost

00:11:02.077 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:90%
feel like an eavesdropper.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm watching them.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening to
their conversations.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.345 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually
rather innocuous.

00:11:09.345 --> 00:11:13.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of dropping
into someone else's reality.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
dimension or whatnot,

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
but I've always found it so
amazing what the being will

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:90%
choose to show to itself--

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Isn't it?

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.190 align:middle line:90%

up or being confined, going

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.696 align:middle line:90%
down to the size of a pea.

>>REGINA: Hearing
your name called out.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Voices calling
your name out, very common.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.493 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Very common.

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I've talked to,
over the years as a counselor,

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:84%
many people who've
lost loved ones,

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and they will
often report having

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
an encounter with that
child or that parent

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:84%
or that friend who's died
as they're falling asleep

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.840 align:middle line:84%
or waking up in those
in-between worlds.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's very common for
more to pass into our awareness

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.034 align:middle line:84%
than does normally in
our conscious going

00:12:05.034 --> 00:12:05.825 align:middle line:90%
about our business.

00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:90%

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.736 align:middle line:84%
-There you are right
there with the baby.

00:13:03.736 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:90%
-Mm-hmm.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:05.335 align:middle line:90%
-Is that you?

00:13:05.335 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:90%
-See what you--

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:90%
-Did I even see you?

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:90%
-I don't know.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:90%
-Oh.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:90%
So did you find it?

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:90%
-Find what?

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.156 align:middle line:90%
-I had the tooth on.

00:13:13.156 --> 00:13:13.655 align:middle line:90%
-Find what?

00:13:13.655 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Find what?

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.530 align:middle line:84%
-I put it there because
it came out last night.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.805 align:middle line:90%
-What?

00:13:15.805 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:90%
-Your tooth?

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.335 align:middle line:90%
-Tooth?

00:13:16.335 --> 00:13:17.382 align:middle line:90%
-You're the Tooth Fairy.

00:13:17.382 --> 00:13:18.465 align:middle line:90%
-My teeth didn't come out.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:19.321 align:middle line:90%
-I don't know.

00:13:19.321 --> 00:13:21.205 align:middle line:90%
-You look like the Tooth Fairy.

00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
-What the hell? [CHUCKLES]
Are you serious?

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what did you
learn in your research

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.910 align:middle line:84%
about that particular
practice that

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:84%
happens with some
people in sleep?

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:34.362 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:13:34.362 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
That's actually when
we're in our deepest

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.610 align:middle line:84%
sleep is when
sleepwalking occurs.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.034 align:middle line:84%
And it can be
dangerous, actually.

00:13:44.034 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you bet.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:90%
People can hop in cars.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm surprised--

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: I'm surprised he
didn't fall down those stairs.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Although sometimes
it's very innocuous.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who
oftentimes wakes up,

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's all these little
cracker crumbs in her bed.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And she realizes she's
gone and gotten crackers

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:84%
from the kitchen and eaten
them all in the night.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And people have been known
to empty their refrigerators,

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:84%
to do compulsive
eating in their sleep.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
it's more common

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
when people take sleep aids,
and that's specifically

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.580 align:middle line:84%
sleep medications, or if they
aren't getting enough sleep

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.247 align:middle line:84%
or they're sleep-deprived
in some way.

00:14:27.247 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:84%
That's when it's
more likely to occur.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are some of
the wildest things that you've

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.785 align:middle line:84%
read about in your research that
people do while they're asleep?

00:14:33.785 --> 00:14:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Gosh.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just shocking

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.288 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: The things
reported in the dream.

00:14:36.288 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:84%
People have hopped in cars
and gone to do errands

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and gotten in accidents
and gotten out of the car

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and peed in the middle of the
street and told off the officer

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and never woken up
during the whole thing.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: Actually, it is
a defense in court now,

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Ambien especially.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ambien?

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: Yeah, especially,
although I think probably some

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:90%
of the other sleep medications--

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like the
Ambien defense?

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: --do foster that.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.622 align:middle line:84%
Ambien zombies is
what they call them.

00:15:05.622 --> 00:15:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
we're going to talk

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:84%
about these classifications
of drugs a little later on,

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.480 align:middle line:84%
from when they first
started and what they do.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And we could talk a little bit
more-- I love Salvador Dali.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:10%
Some of the images, like
the bizarre cartoons

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:10%
I watch, these cartoon
characters animated,

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.417 align:middle line:10%
that's where Salvador Dali
got a lot of his inspiration--

00:15:27.417 --> 00:15:28.625 align:middle line:10%
>>DUFF: A lot of his imagery.

00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --and his imagery.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.535 align:middle line:10%
>>DUFF: Mm-hmm.

00:15:29.535 --> 00:15:31.780 align:middle line:10%
And he said eating sea
urchins was the best

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.012 align:middle line:10%
for fostering those, if you--

00:15:33.012 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Eating sea urchins.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: --want to try it.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds like it
would be incredibly toxic.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: At this point, maybe.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, at
this point maybe.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:10%
And then the famous
philosopher Swedenborg,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:10%
he said he went somewhere
between heaven and hell

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.369 align:middle line:10%
during that time.

00:15:46.369 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:10%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.410 align:middle line:10%
He would travel out with the
planets and other universes

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:10%
and back, yeah.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
begs the question,

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:84%
when we're in sleep-- first of
all, that's crossover sleep.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.640 align:middle line:84%
We're not in deep
sleep at that point.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.139 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes.

00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:01.387 align:middle line:90%
Mm hmm.

00:16:01.387 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it appears
that even at that time we

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.190 align:middle line:84%
might be interfacing with
perhaps other dimensions

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:84%
of reality and beings,
even in the lightest

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.939 align:middle line:90%
states of crossover into sleep.

00:16:10.939 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: I personally
think that's possible.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I've had experiences
along those lines,

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and of course I've talked
to people who have.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not scientifically
recognized,

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:84%
although there is
pretty good research

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that we are more intuitive
in those mixed states

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:90%
than at other times.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of the
leading kind of frontiers

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:84%
of scientific
research at this point

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
is the relationship
between consciousness

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:90%
and consciousnesses.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
it seems like that's also

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:51.469 align:middle line:84%
a time when a lot of people
do their out-of-body travel.

00:16:51.469 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:52.807 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:52.807 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they have
conscious awareness of it.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:55.515 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Mm hmm.

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And lucid dreaming
as well is most

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:84%
likely to be able to occur
when we're in those threshold

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:84%
states, lucid
dreaming meaning we're

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
dreaming but we
know we're dreaming,

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:84%
and so we can actually impact
the dream in some ways.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So can we consciously
foster those states so that we

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.990 align:middle line:84%
can then choose to have
these experiences we

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:90%
want in this crossover place?

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: We certainly
can foster those states.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.692 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots of good
books about lucid dreaming.

00:17:25.692 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:90%
They have suggestions--

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.566 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And out-of-body
experiences as well.

00:17:28.566 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: Out-of-body
experiences as well, yes.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I tend to take more of a-- I'm
less interested in controlling

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
my experiences than
I am in opening

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and receiving and
learning from them.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So I tend to focus more on
just staying open and trying

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
to hold different levels of
awareness at the same time.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we saw what
happens during sleepwalking.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.990 align:middle line:90%
What about sleep paralysis?

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.349 align:middle line:84%
Because this is really
frightening to people.

00:17:58.349 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: It is terrifying.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.931 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you
can talk about that,

00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:84%
talk about how it's dovetailing
with what's commonly

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:84%
called the abduction experience
and so forth and just tell us

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.061 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Sleep paralysis is what
the scientists call it.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:84%
There are names for it in
just about every language

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Every culture, every
time has described,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.160 align:middle line:84%
people have described having
experiences where they are

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:84%
awake but they cannot
move their bodies.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:90%
They cannot cry out.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't have control over
their voluntary muscles.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes it is
accompanied by the experience

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:84%
of what feels to be a malevolent
spirit, although not always

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:84%
malevolent, but a malevolent
spirit that feels like it's

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
jumped on your chest
and is suffocating you.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I remember once when I lived
in a collective household

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:84%
my friend running into my room
in the middle of the night.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I've just escaped
this thing that

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:90%
was trying to suffocate me.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.230 align:middle line:84%
She had just had
that experience.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Now scientifically what
appears to be happening

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
is that when we
have dreams there

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:84%
is a mechanism in our
bodies that shuts down

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.590 align:middle line:84%
our control of our
voluntary muscles.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we would literally
be acting out all of our dreams

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and running and
chasing and doing

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.818 align:middle line:84%
all the things we
do in our dreams.

00:19:18.818 --> 00:19:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So it shuts down
that muscle control,

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.552 align:middle line:84%
and the body relies on
the autonomic functions

00:19:25.552 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
of the heartbeat and breathing,
and shallow breathing

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.280 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But normally you would
have no awareness at this time.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.285 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: Of course,
because normally you'd--

00:19:31.285 --> 00:19:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd be in
a deep, deep sleep.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.066 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: --be sleeping, yes.

00:19:33.066 --> 00:19:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Uh huh.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
with sleep paralysis

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
is that we are consciously
awake and aware,

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
but that mechanism has
shut down the muscles.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Now what is curious to me
is that throughout the ages

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and across many,
many cultures there

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:58.355 align:middle line:84%
have been descriptions of
these malevolent spirits.

00:19:58.355 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
come in the night.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: That come
at these times.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
they're so terrifying.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I have had the
experience of not being

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:12.830 align:middle line:84%
able to move or cry out or speak
when I'm waking up from sleep,

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't
terrifying because there

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.620 align:middle line:84%
was no malevolent
spirit with it.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:84%
It was just kind of like let
me wait till I can actually

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:84%
move and speak,
and it came along.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So there are a couple
ways to understand that.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.150 align:middle line:84%
A scientific perspective
would suggest--

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and evolutionary
biologists have proposed

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:84%
this as a possibility--
that we are neurologically

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:44.830 align:middle line:84%
wired to assume, in a state of
alarm, that there is a threat

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and to kind of embellish
that threat in order

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:84%
to be able to respond
as quickly as we can.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So it may be that we
hallucinate that to match

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:90%
the level of terror we feel.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And it may be a neurological
mechanism left over

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.570 align:middle line:84%
from our evolutionary past
when it was of benefit to be

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.509 align:middle line:84%
able to respond quickly
to an alarming--

00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A threat.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.133 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: --situation.

00:21:13.133 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
It's also possible that we
are, in these mixed states,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:90%
more vulnerable to spirits.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at the work
of Dr. John Mack, for example,

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
very common where it
didn't matter where

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.559 align:middle line:84%
the person was from,
anything about them.

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:33.225 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter if
this group of people

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:90%
had nothing in common.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
The experiences they seemed to
have in that place of paralysis

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:84%
was either a time shift
to another reality

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.537 align:middle line:90%
or being with alien species.

00:21:44.537 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Right.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they kept having
the same kind of hallmark

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
experiences, same kind
of places they'd go to.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So you have to-- certainly it's
worth considering that that

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:54.820 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.155 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:21:55.155 --> 00:21:56.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --a reality as well.

00:21:56.405 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: That it's
very possible, yes.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
But our Western
scientific tradition

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.460 align:middle line:84%
refuses the
possibility that there

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:84%
could be spirits or entities,
and so that's kept out.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's one reason why there
is a common cultural tradition

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world in
different cultures of not

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
abruptly waking up
someone who's sleeping,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:90%
of not waking them sharply.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Because the notion is
that their spirits travel,

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:84%
our spirits travel
when we sleep,

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and they need to come
back into our bodies.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And if we wake up
someone too fast,

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.340 align:middle line:84%
they can be
disorganized and have

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
a hard time bringing
themselves back.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I wonder about that.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:84%
What about a society that needs
to be awakened by an alarm

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:84%
clock because our institutions
start everyone so early

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:84%
in the day, including
little children?

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
What is that doing
to us en masse

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:90%
to have this shock of waking up?

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking you that question.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And I will add a comment
that personally when

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm awakened sharply and I'm
not back into the body yet,

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.190 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the day is ruined.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.977 align:middle line:90%
I'm sluggish, disoriented.

00:23:03.977 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: It's like
they say getting out

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:90%
of the wrong side of the bed.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:84%
It forces you to get out of
the wrong side of the bed--

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But there are people--

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: --and it's
hard to get back.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that live
like that every day.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Every day, I know.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And it also robs us of
what sleep is offering us,

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
not in the sense of the
physiological renewal, which

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:90%
does happen when we sleep.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:28.620 align:middle line:84%
But when we are shaken out of
our sleep, we don't get to rise

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and mingle with the
sleep experiences

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.270 align:middle line:90%
and the daytime experiences.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't get to
dialogue in a sense.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to
remember our dreams usually

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.370 align:middle line:90%
if we're woken suddenly.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, we're stolen
from our night lives that way.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You talk about
in these states of sleep--

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.150 align:middle line:84%
we know what REM is,
but talk about REM--

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:84%
but also you talk about
slow wave, a slow wave

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.165 align:middle line:90%
time of sleep.

00:23:56.165 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't heard about that
before reading your book.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:90%
What are these different states?

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:10%
>>DUFF: Scientists have
identified several stages

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:10%
of sleep based on the
EEG brain wave patterns.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:10%
But the two basic ones
are deep slow wave sleep

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:10%
that tends to dominate the
first few hours of our sleep,

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.120 align:middle line:10%
and that's the most
physically restorative.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:84%
That's when the growth
hormone is released.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what keeps
our skin elastic.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what keeps our muscles
strong, keeps our memories

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:90%
good, that kind of thing.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And then there is at the other
extreme a very light sleep--

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:84%
it's called Rapid Eye
Movement-- when we're

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:84%
most likely to dream,
although it's not

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:90%
the only time we dream.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
brain is very active.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
interesting things

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:84%
I found out in writing
and working on this book

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:84%
is that Eastern philosophic
traditions-- Hindu, Buddhist,

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:84%
even Taoist and
Sufi traditions--

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.650 align:middle line:84%
have studied sleep and
identified these stages

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
for millennia, for thousands
and thousands of years.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And from that
Eastern perspective,

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:10.320 align:middle line:84%
deep sleep is the most
sought after state of mind.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
That's when we release
our egos and we release

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:84%
our notions of what is and we
merge with the whole of things

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:90%
from that Eastern perspective.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.938 align:middle line:84%
And so they would say we are
most deluded when we are awake

00:25:27.938 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and convincing ourselves
that this is a table,

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.700 align:middle line:84%
this is a wall, everything we've
identified what it is and we've

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:84%
named it and labeled it and
have our attitudes about it.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
We are a little less deluded
from that perspective

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.130 align:middle line:90%
when we are dreaming.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:84%
We allow a little
more flexibility

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:84%
in our world and
our experiences.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.384 align:middle line:84%
And we are the
most clear, we are

00:25:49.384 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:84%
closest with what the Buddhists
would call the clear light

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.510 align:middle line:84%
mind when we are
in that deep sleep.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.530 align:middle line:90%
And many things disturb that.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For example,
you write in the book

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
about the introduction
of the coffee houses

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.970 align:middle line:84%
to London in the
1700s where that's

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.880 align:middle line:84%
where it started becoming
mind was more important.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Sharing ideas and invention
was more important.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.150 align:middle line:90%
And there was no time for sleep.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And so let's look at some of the
things like coffee and caffeine

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:84%
that disturb the sleep
so we may not even

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.169 align:middle line:84%
find ourselves gravitating
into that slow wave sleep.

00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.609 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:25.609 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
They called it with the
rise of the Enlightenment.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was that focus
on light as opposed

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:84%
to darkness, that focus
on daytime as opposed

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.480 align:middle line:84%
to nighttime, which
was then demonized.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Then with
industrialization we have

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:84%
people being required
to work out of the home.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.244 align:middle line:84%
So then their sleep has to
consolidate into one time

00:26:49.244 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
at night, because
they're spending

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:90%
long times out of the house.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Then artificial
light came along,

00:26:55.470 --> 00:27:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and that had us awake more
at night and sleeping less.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we came along, the
Computer Age with our LED

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.470 align:middle line:84%
screens, and those produce a lot
of the blue waves that actually

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:84%
tell our eyes and
our pineal glands

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.654 align:middle line:90%
that we are to be awake now.

00:27:13.654 --> 00:27:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: They are awakening.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you're
reading your email before you

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.929 align:middle line:84%
go to bed at night,
bad idea, huh?

00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Or playing Solitaire, one of
my favorites on the computer,

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.130 align:middle line:90%
or doing that shopping.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
You know how hours
can go by at night

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:84%
when you're on that-- that's
because those blue frequency

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.740 align:middle line:84%
lights are telling your body
and your brain to stay awake.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you're going
to have more difficulty going

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.329 align:middle line:90%
into that slow wave state.

00:27:37.329 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Now a good time to do
those things, of course,

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.094 align:middle line:90%
is the morning.

00:27:40.094 --> 00:27:40.932 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:40.932 --> 00:27:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And also to get out in
the sunlight in the morning.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And that helps set
our circadian cycles

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:84%
to be awake when
we want to be awake

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and then later on
to be able to sleep.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
are cultures that--

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and I love this part of the
book-- that sleep together.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:90%
People sleep more in groups.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
consider it a crime

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.610 align:middle line:84%
to leave a child by itself,
a baby in particular.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Talk to us about this.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: I was so interested
to find out about that.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.770 align:middle line:84%
There are some
age-old practices that

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:84%
are nearly universal in
preindustrial cultures

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:84%
or non-Westernized
cultures, really.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Because even in Western
fully industrialized cultures

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.980 align:middle line:84%
in Asia-- for example,
Korea and Japan and China--

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:35.346 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't dream of putting
an infant in another room.

00:28:35.346 --> 00:28:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And it's become
controversial now,

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's called co-sleeping
and people sharing a mattress.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:43.910 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be that.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:84%
But historically and in terms
of evolution, the pattern

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:84%
has been for infants to sleep
very close to their caregivers,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.680 align:middle line:90%
within arm's reach.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, because
we evolved to a point

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.530 align:middle line:84%
where we stood
upright, we needed

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.960 align:middle line:84%
to have more narrow
pelvises, which

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:84%
means that our babies
needed to be born sooner,

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.700 align:middle line:84%
which means that
human infants do

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.560 align:middle line:84%
a lot of their neurological
development after they're born.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And how that neurological
development occurs

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is in contact with
their caregivers.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:84%
That's how they learn to
manage their breathing,

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.070 align:middle line:84%
manage their autonomic arousal,
manage their-- learn how

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:90%
to sleep.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they don't--
Even body temperature,

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.860 align:middle line:84%
all those autonomic functions
are neurologically developed

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.950 align:middle line:84%
after we're born in contact with
someone for whom those patterns

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.290 align:middle line:84%
are well-established
neurologically.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So for many cultures, when
they would ask the mothers

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:53.890 align:middle line:84%
or parents why do you
sleep with your babies,

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:56.090 align:middle line:90%
they would have their reasons.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.840 align:middle line:90%
So they will be good children.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.150 align:middle line:90%
So we can care for them.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
So we can respond
quickly to their needs.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until,
really, the modern age

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:84%
that it became a sign of
wealth to have more rooms,

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and there became this attitude
in the Euro-American traditions

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that it spoiled the baby to
respond quickly to their needs.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it became a practice
to try to separate, especially

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:84%
mother and child, as
quickly as possible.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:36.397 align:middle line:84%
And that has become quite
problematic at this point.

00:30:36.397 --> 00:30:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yes.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:84%
We've all either been
party to or witnessed

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:90%
this aspect of our culture.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Yet it feels wrong.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.124 align:middle line:84%
With almost every
mother it feels wrong.

00:30:44.124 --> 00:30:44.915 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:30:44.915 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet the parents or
the pediatrician or the husband

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.060 align:middle line:84%
or someone will say, no,
just leave them in their room

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.460 align:middle line:90%
and let them cry it out.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.960 align:middle line:84%
A tiny little baby
who just emerged

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.900 align:middle line:84%
from a very safe,
enclosed environment

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.360 align:middle line:90%
into this vast, cold world--

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Emptiness.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to leave
them alone by themselves,

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to talk about
what the studies are showing

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.300 align:middle line:84%
now in terms of what
happens to the development

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.210 align:middle line:90%
of these little human beings.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: There is no
other animal that

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.414 align:middle line:84%
ignores the cries
of their young.

00:31:18.414 --> 00:31:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're pack--

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.330 align:middle line:90%
And we are pack animals.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: We are, absolutely.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, it is not
our instinct to ignore.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It is a very
stressful experience

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:84%
for infant and caregiver to
ignore distress vocalizations,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.330 align:middle line:90%
as they're called.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And our cortisol, our
stress hormones rage

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:45.310 align:middle line:84%
when that happens in both
the parent and the child.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:84%
If you leave that child,
that infant to cry it out--

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and they will at some point cry
it out when they realize that

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:90%
they are, in effect, abandoned--

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.700 align:middle line:84%
You'll become fatigued and
stop through shared fatigue.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:31:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Right.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Uh huh.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That doesn't
mean they're calm.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Right.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And when they've actually
looked at the stress hormones,

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:84%
once the baby stops crying,
the mother's stress hormones

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.230 align:middle line:84%
go right back down
again and she feels OK.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Baby's OK.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Baby's stress
hormones stay high.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
high stress hormones

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.740 align:middle line:84%
consistently, that
actually inhibits

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.370 align:middle line:84%
neurological development,
so it becomes

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:29.760 align:middle line:90%
quite problematic at that point.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Now obviously it's not a
black or white situation.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I know many parents who have
let their baby cry it out,

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and the babies
are not destroyed.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:48.840 align:middle line:84%
But the need to respond
to distress vocalizations

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.390 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And now even the parenting
experts who used to say

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.460 align:middle line:84%
let them cry it out, you've
got to get your sleep will now

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.690 align:middle line:84%
say go in and talk to
that child at least.

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:84%
At the very least, let that
child know your presence.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.900 align:middle line:84%
They need to hear
and sense in some way

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.800 align:middle line:84%
your presence in order to be
able to literally calm down

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and in order to develop the
capacity to, what they say,

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:84%
self-soothe, which is what we're
learning to do neurologically

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.427 align:middle line:90%
when we get all worked up.

00:33:19.427 --> 00:33:21.260 align:middle line:84%
You know how a baby
when they get worked up,

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:84%
they can't calm
themselves back down.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.650 align:middle line:90%
They just can't.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:84%
They need that parent to
rock them and talk to them

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and sing and do those
things to calm them down.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what needs
to happen, yeah.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In a lot of
cultures, the children

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:84%
sleep either with or
right next to the parents

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.490 align:middle line:90%
up to the age of, say, five.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's pretty
common in a lot of cultures.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:42.241 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:33:42.241 --> 00:33:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
the hallmark of socialization,

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:49.320 align:middle line:84%
of community and behavioral
development in that.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.362 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:53.070 align:middle line:84%
There have been some
interesting studies.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Now they do have their
flaws, because you

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:03.270 align:middle line:84%
can't in good conscience
give a child a cry

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.250 align:middle line:90%
it out method and the not.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:05.814 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:34:05.814 --> 00:34:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: But they have done
studies where they looked

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:14.310 align:middle line:84%
at children who were-- who
slept right near their parents

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:84%
for the first five years
of life, for example,

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.673 align:middle line:84%
and then looked at them as
adults and compared them with

00:34:18.673 --> 00:34:19.570 align:middle line:90%
those who didn't.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is that they
were more cooperative, more--

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
less anxious, less depressed,
more satisfied with life.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.489 align:middle line:84%
Which I find very--
now the reason

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:84%
that they have their
flaws is because there

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.500 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of other
factors besides sleep

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.395 align:middle line:84%
that impacted those people's
lives as they were growing up

00:34:41.395 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:90%
that we had no control over.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:49.139 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to
characterize the Northern

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.820 align:middle line:84%
European or European and
American cultures that

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:84%
have been the most imperialist
cultures historically

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%
on this planet,
we would describe

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.900 align:middle line:84%
those very same qualities--
anxious, depressed, aggressive,

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.190 align:middle line:90%
those qualities.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the ways
in which we sleep have,

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.900 align:middle line:84%
as those Balinese mothers and
Japanese mothers have said,

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.320 align:middle line:84%
we stay close to our baby
so they will be cooperative,

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.950 align:middle line:84%
so they will get
along with others.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It just makes sense.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.771 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I never
could ignore a cry.

00:35:23.771 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to keep my son right
next-- his little bassinet was

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:90%
right here anyway.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I never wanted to
be far from him.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes.

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he was so
mellow, such an easy person.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.710 align:middle line:90%
We were joking before the show.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I got a
pass on motherhood

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.970 align:middle line:90%
because he was so easy.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.969 align:middle line:84%
But there was always that
very close proximity also.

00:35:41.969 --> 00:35:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the American tradition,

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:47.450 align:middle line:84%
the trundle bed was
literally for the baby.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So they would just pull out the
bad and be right next to it.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And then it used to
be-- the nursery used

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.210 align:middle line:84%
to be just a corner of
the parents' bedroom.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a separate room.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:56.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:56.665 --> 00:35:57.310 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:59.265 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: It was just
a little corner.

00:35:59.265 --> 00:35:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.630 align:middle line:84%
It breaks my heart to think
of a little child lying there

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:04.440 align:middle line:84%
crying in the dark
by themselves.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.444 align:middle line:90%
Ugh.

00:36:05.444 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And the
idea was that, oh,

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.234 align:middle line:84%
we'll make them
more independent.

00:36:08.234 --> 00:36:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fact, the
studies suggest--

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.048 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Make them neurotic.

00:36:11.048 --> 00:36:12.474 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes, more neurotic.

00:36:12.474 --> 00:36:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And fearful.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Mm hmm.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And feeling
like life isn't safe.

00:36:15.875 --> 00:36:16.416 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:36:16.416 --> 00:36:17.269 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:17.269 --> 00:36:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not good.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's move on to the subject of
dreams, including bad dreams,

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.935 align:middle line:84%
because you have an
interesting take on that

00:36:25.935 --> 00:36:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that the research
showed you that this

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.560 align:middle line:90%
might be a practice of sorts.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Well, yes.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have
often wondered why

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.876 align:middle line:84%
we sleep and then, of
course, why we dream.

00:36:36.876 --> 00:36:37.712 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:37.712 --> 00:36:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And one of the
prevailing theories

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:45.450 align:middle line:84%
at this point-- evolutionary
neurologists have posed

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:51.520 align:middle line:84%
it-- is that we dream in
order to practice our survival

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.400 align:middle line:84%
strategies, which makes
sense with a lot of the kind

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.300 align:middle line:84%
of anxiety dreams we have,
or running to catch the bus,

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.055 align:middle line:84%
trying to get to the class on
time, remembering our shoes

00:37:02.055 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:90%
when we, you know.

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.190 align:middle line:84%
All the things
that we have to do,

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.180 align:middle line:90%
we're practicing, in a sense.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And people who play soccer a
lot play soccer in their dreams

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.170 align:middle line:84%
or play the piano
in their dreams.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that reinforces

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:84%
that notion is that infants,
who sleep a lot of the day,

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.830 align:middle line:84%
spend a lot of that time in
dream sleep, in REM sleep.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's understood
that we are actually

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:84%
developing our neurological
structures in REM sleep.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So when we are
practicing things,

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:42.230 align:middle line:84%
we're actually kind of laying
the network for that skill

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.159 align:middle line:90%
that we're practicing.

00:37:43.159 --> 00:37:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the
recurring dreams that we have?

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: Oh, they
are so fascinating.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at them from a
lot of different perspectives.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I have kept track of my
dreams for decades now.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, I didn't take
any one perspective on it,

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.446 align:middle line:84%
because I find that you can go
into a Jungian point of view

00:38:03.446 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and get a lot out
of that and you

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.560 align:middle line:84%
can go into an
evolutionary point of view

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.976 align:middle line:84%
and get a lot out
of that, and you

00:38:07.976 --> 00:38:13.240 align:middle line:84%
can go into you know, a lot
of different-- a spiritualist

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.260 align:middle line:84%
point of view, a lot of
different perspectives

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.380 align:middle line:90%
and get a lot from our dreams.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that is also clear
is that our dreams access a lot

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:29.860 align:middle line:84%
more information than we have
consciously aware-- in touch

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.920 align:middle line:90%
with during the daytime.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Oliver Sacks talks about-- he's
the famous neurologist who's

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.660 align:middle line:84%
written about various
kinds of people

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.410 align:middle line:84%
with different
kinds of disorders--

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and he's noted that oftentimes
his patients have dreamt

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.690 align:middle line:84%
about their disorder
before it developed.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.530 align:middle line:84%
They dreamt that
they were frozen

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.485 align:middle line:84%
before they developed
catatonia, for example.

00:38:51.485 --> 00:38:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And, gosh, Galen, a
lot of the ancient physicians

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.330 align:middle line:84%
in the East and the
West turned to dreams

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:06.700 align:middle line:84%
to help with diagnosis and
also with help with treatment,

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:84%
because our dreams
can access a lot more

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.280 align:middle line:84%
of what's going
on in our bodies.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And a lot, I suspect, more
familial and ancestral

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:18.530 align:middle line:84%
information and
evolutionary information

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:90%
is available as well.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.936 align:middle line:84%
There was one reoccurring
dream I had for many years

00:39:24.936 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with
being in a vehicle,

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.880 align:middle line:90%
starting at three years old.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I was born and lived
in San Francisco.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.567 align:middle line:84%
And starting at three years
old, I'd be in the backseat,

00:39:32.567 --> 00:39:34.900 align:middle line:84%
there would be no driver, and
it would be careening down

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.209 align:middle line:84%
Van Ness Avenue toward
the ocean, right?

00:39:37.209 --> 00:39:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.083 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And of course,
before you splash into the sea,

00:39:40.083 --> 00:39:40.660 align:middle line:90%
you wake up.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
as the years went on,

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.110 align:middle line:90%
it became whatever it was.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Then I got my driver's
license, and then I

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.820 align:middle line:84%
would be responsible
for driving people.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It went on and on until finally,
which it broke that dream

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.110 align:middle line:84%
sequence permanently,
I was in Berkeley

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:59.950 align:middle line:84%
in the hills of Berkeley,
which some of them

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.930 align:middle line:84%
are extremely steep, like in
San Francisco, and in this dream

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.780 align:middle line:84%
it was like a Wayne
Thiebaud painting.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Oh.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The streets
were like this.

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:08.118 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes, yes.

00:40:08.118 --> 00:40:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I was driving
this car and came to a point

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:13.720 align:middle line:84%
on the hill that was the
crest, and if you made it over,

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.950 align:middle line:90%
you lived.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
make it over, you

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.930 align:middle line:84%
had to go on a road that
curved back on itself so it

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.190 align:middle line:84%
defied gravity and then
go around an over the top.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Wow.

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.564 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I watched
a red Corvette do it.

00:40:24.564 --> 00:40:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Some guy was driving
a red Corvette.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And my passenger's
like, don't do this.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Oh.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I said,
no, I just saw it.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:90%
If he can do it, it can be done.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And so there was obviously
some very deep process

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.230 align:middle line:84%
of practice and
strengthening maybe qualities

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.140 align:middle line:90%
of belief in self and so forth.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:43.770 align:middle line:90%
And I did it.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So I gunned it, and I said,
hang on, we can do it.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And we just barely crested
over and made it in.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:49.730 align:middle line:90%
And it ended--

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: And that was the end.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that
sequence of dreams.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:52.640 align:middle line:90%
I haven't had once since.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.840 align:middle line:90%
And that was a lifelong thing.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Isn't that interesting.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that,
to me, was an example

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.930 align:middle line:84%
of practicing our
whatever, our proficiency,

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:01.186 align:middle line:90%
our confidence in life.

00:41:01.186 --> 00:41:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Mm hmm.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.490 align:middle line:90%
That's an excellent example.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I know the driver
today was telling me

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:11.540 align:middle line:84%
about a dream he had once in
which Boulder Creek turned

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.950 align:middle line:84%
direction, turned
around and went back up.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was asking about
that time in his life.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yes, that was a
time of big changes in my life

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.220 align:middle line:84%
where I really had to
turn everything around.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And in the book, I
talk about Lyndon Johnson had

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.622 align:middle line:84%
a recurring dream over the
course of his lifetime.

00:41:30.622 --> 00:41:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.371 align:middle line:90%
Share that with us.

00:41:32.371 --> 00:41:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: From childhood
through his presidency.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.230 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't come often,
but it was a nightmare

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:40.850 align:middle line:84%
that would return where
he was in some way

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
or another unable to move
or to get where he needed

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:84%
to go, whether he was tied
to a chair in the middle

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.790 align:middle line:84%
of a pasture and the
cows were charging in

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.770 align:middle line:84%
or whether he was trying
to swim across the river

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't make it and was
just swimming in circles.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And he told his biographer
Doris Kearns about these dreams.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.900 align:middle line:90%
They were that important to him.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.816 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:03.816 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And the
last one occurred--

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was the
swimming in circles one--

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and he woke up from
that one, and that's

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.854 align:middle line:84%
when he decided that we
needed to get out of Vietnam.

00:42:14.854 --> 00:42:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:16.644 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:16.644 --> 00:42:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
absolutely fascinating.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And more than we
know, these dreams

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.760 align:middle line:84%
are influencing
very large decisions

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.532 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
around the planet.

00:42:24.532 --> 00:42:25.323 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:42:25.323 --> 00:42:26.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a
short while ago--

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and I forget which president
it was-- it was a 20th century

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:36.730 align:middle line:84%
president who had a dream
that there was a major plane

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:40.964 align:middle line:84%
crash at a Maryland airport
that was very small.

00:42:40.964 --> 00:42:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And he woke up and he went
to Congress, and he said,

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I had this dream.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.040 align:middle line:84%
We need to fix this
airport and make it safer.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And Congress right away
gave him the money,

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and they went and
fixed the airport.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine that
happening nowadays?

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No,
unfortunately I can't.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I remember having
one of those dreams--

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and I want to talk about
this-- these collective dreams.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It was probably
15 or 20 years ago

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.590 align:middle line:84%
where I dreamt that a missile
was shot off and then crashed.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And it crashed the next
morning when they shot one off

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:11.740 align:middle line:90%
from Vandenberg Air Force Base.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of thing,
that collective dreaming,

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.195 align:middle line:84%
happened in spades
around events like 9/11.

00:43:17.195 --> 00:43:17.695 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes.

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
talk about what's

00:43:19.418 --> 00:43:21.040 align:middle line:84%
happening in these
collective dreams?

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: You know, I'm not
sure what's happening,

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.860 align:middle line:84%
except that they
are very common.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And it does make you question
our notion of time as linear,

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.490 align:middle line:84%
that there's a before
and a now and an after.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Because when we have
precognitive dreams--

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and every system of
dream interpretation

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.270 align:middle line:84%
has always acknowledged
that sometimes there

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:49.300 align:middle line:84%
are precognitive
dreams-- we have

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.080 align:middle line:84%
to somehow realize
that dreaming taps

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.030 align:middle line:84%
into a reality in which
time is more fluid.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
brings big questions up.

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.250 align:middle line:84%
If you're tapping in
collectively to an event

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:02.500 align:middle line:84%
before it's occurred, it
brings the whole notion

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:03.894 align:middle line:90%
of our time/space continuum--

00:44:03.894 --> 00:44:04.685 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:44:04.685 --> 00:44:05.325 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --into question.

00:44:05.325 --> 00:44:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Mm hmm.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
is predetermined,

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:11.210 align:middle line:84%
for example, versus what are
we responding to because we can

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:13.860 align:middle line:84%
feel the frequencies
in motion and all that?

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It brings up a lot
of larger questions.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And people have pondered
those questions forever,

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.140 align:middle line:90%
even in the Western tradition.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:20.994 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:20.994 --> 00:44:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: One of my favorite--

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.020 align:middle line:84%
or, the first dream
encyclopedia was

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:29.160 align:middle line:84%
written a few thousand years
ago by a man named Artemidorus.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And he traveled all
over the Mideast talking

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.710 align:middle line:84%
to all kinds of
soothsayers and dreamers

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:38.320 align:middle line:84%
from a lot of
different traditions.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.150 align:middle line:84%
It was at a time when
the East and the West

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:43.150 align:middle line:84%
were much more mingled than
they are or have been recently.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And he really
tried to figure out

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:50.540 align:middle line:84%
what was happening with
the precognitive dreams.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And he eventually had to
say that it was something

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:01.270 align:middle line:84%
like-- is it that
the dream comes to us

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and gives us this
information about the future

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.890 align:middle line:84%
or is it that we
can imagine forward?

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's some combination of the
two, a reflexive relationship

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.174 align:middle line:84%
with the universe that occurs,
I think, in dreaming at times.

00:45:15.174 --> 00:45:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:17.174 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Mm hmm.

00:45:17.174 --> 00:45:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mentioned
at the very early part

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.780 align:middle line:84%
of our conversation
that it used to be

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.430 align:middle line:84%
very common before the
industrialized world

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and before artificial light,
for example, for people

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:30.130 align:middle line:84%
to go to bed when the
sun went down early

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:33.260 align:middle line:84%
but to have two separate
segments of sleep per night.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.075 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that gap in between.

00:45:35.075 --> 00:45:35.741 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Oh, yes.

00:45:35.741 --> 00:45:37.533 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I
think that's actually--

00:45:37.533 --> 00:45:39.741 align:middle line:84%
we don't give ourselves
permission, because we think,

00:45:39.741 --> 00:45:40.770 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, I woke up.

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:42.645 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a hard time
getting back to sleep.

00:45:42.645 --> 00:45:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And we punish
ourselves and wait,

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and of course time
passes very slowly then.

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.790 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, let's talk about
the beauty of that gap time

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:52.130 align:middle line:84%
when we're awake in the
middle of the night.

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: In pre-modern
times, it was

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.780 align:middle line:84%
called-- pre-modern
European worlds,

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:00.260 align:middle line:84%
it was called the
watch or the vigil.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And people would get up in the
night and they'd write poetry.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.320 align:middle line:90%
They'd visit with each other.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:09.020 align:middle line:84%
They'd make some beer
or steal an apple

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.806 align:middle line:84%
from the neighbor's
orchard, just

00:46:11.806 --> 00:46:13.180 align:middle line:84%
do things you can
do in the dark.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:16.310 align:middle line:90%


00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But now that we have
more awareness of what

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.160 align:middle line:84%
happens in sleep,
that watch time

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.360 align:middle line:84%
is very valuable,
because it comes

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.940 align:middle line:84%
after most of our deep sleep,
most of that physically

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:35.050 align:middle line:84%
restorative sleep and
before the dream sleep.

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a time
outside of time almost.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:40.425 align:middle line:84%
And many artists and
writers will talk about it.

00:46:40.425 --> 00:46:43.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of poets will talk about
this is their magic hour.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.750 align:middle line:84%
This is when
inspiration can come.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:53.260 align:middle line:84%
This is when there are
not the bright lights

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:58.690 align:middle line:84%
to blind us to the
currents that can occur,

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:04.150 align:middle line:84%
the ways in which we can open to
the natural world, in a sense.

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I realized
as I was working on this

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:12.590 align:middle line:84%
is that sleep is perhaps the
most intimate way in which we

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:15.600 align:middle line:84%
experience the natural
world, in which we

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.630 align:middle line:90%
are participating in nature.

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Because every cell, every
creature, every plant,

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:25.150 align:middle line:84%
every animal, everything
on this planet

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:29.390 align:middle line:84%
that rotates every 24
hours has a circadian cycle

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:33.240 align:middle line:84%
and these alternating cycles
of light and dark and rest

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.190 align:middle line:90%
and activity.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And we as human
beings, we lie down

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:43.990 align:middle line:84%
to return to that earthly
nature that we belong to

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and that we are one with
in that sense at that time.

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
have-- especially

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:53.010 align:middle line:84%
since reading your book,
it definitely impressed me

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that that time where you
might wake up a few hours,

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.375 align:middle line:84%
three or four hours
into your sleep,

00:47:57.375 --> 00:48:00.930 align:middle line:84%
is actually-- I have
always enjoyed that time,

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.520 align:middle line:84%
but I would always try to
hurry and get back to sleep.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.225 align:middle line:84%
And now I think just to
spend more time in that zone

00:48:06.225 --> 00:48:08.390 align:middle line:84%
where we have no
obligation, there's

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:11.860 align:middle line:84%
no light, it's our
own little world,

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that we can do anything
we wish with in our minds

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and drift between
worlds, and so that's

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.575 align:middle line:84%
a valid way to-- that was
always a valid way to sleep,

00:48:19.575 --> 00:48:20.450 align:middle line:90%
it sounds like.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah, absolutely.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
very recent decades

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:32.330 align:middle line:84%
that it began to be defined as a
kind of insomnia, as a problem.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the middle of
the night insomnia or sleep

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.270 align:middle line:90%
maintenance insomnia.

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:40.100 align:middle line:84%
There's various names
for it in sleep medicine.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.300 align:middle line:84%
It is the most commonly
reported kind of insomnia.

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
natural to us to wake up.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:48.140 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
beginning to realize

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:52.250 align:middle line:84%
is that we have these
natural rhythms of resting

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and being more
awake and that that

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.460 align:middle line:84%
happens through the
night as well as the day.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it is that natural rhythm
breaking through, absolutely.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And really what it is
is it's not a problem

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:12.065 align:middle line:84%
unless our daily lives
have commandeered too many

00:49:12.065 --> 00:49:13.874 align:middle line:90%
of the hours of our day.

00:49:13.874 --> 00:49:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And the problem is what
we demand of ourselves by day.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:middle line:84%
That's what's created
sleep problems.

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we don't
know how to sleep.

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.827 align:middle line:84%
It's that we are drinking all
that caffeine, that we are--

00:49:27.827 --> 00:49:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying to squeeze
more out of ourselves.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And trying
to compress that

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:33.680 align:middle line:84%
sleep into shorter
and shorter times

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and expecting to fall right
asleep and wake up right away

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and never wake up in between.

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:41.737 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
really unnatural.

00:49:41.737 --> 00:49:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about the ways

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.417 align:middle line:84%
in which we force
ourselves into sleep.

00:49:45.417 --> 00:49:47.875 align:middle line:84%
And it started out with, I
think you said, chloral hydrate.

00:49:47.875 --> 00:49:48.374 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes.

00:49:48.374 --> 00:49:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the lineage of the drugs.

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Oh, gosh.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.650 align:middle line:90%
And there have been quite a few.

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, the famous
Mickey that could

00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:00.350 align:middle line:90%
be slipped in someone's drink.

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, all the famous
Mickeys or rape drugs

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.650 align:middle line:84%
were initially developed
for sleep medication--

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.553 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: --to this day.

00:50:11.553 --> 00:50:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And what became eventually
in the second half

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:19.860 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century
the strongest one

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:21.282 align:middle line:90%
was the benzodiazepines.

00:50:21.282 --> 00:50:21.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:21.865 --> 00:50:24.969 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the characteristics--
you're talking Valium?

00:50:24.969 --> 00:50:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:26.664 align:middle line:90%
Benzodiazepine's also--

00:50:26.664 --> 00:50:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Xanax.

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:28.788 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: --Klonopin,
all those, yes.

00:50:28.788 --> 00:50:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what do those do?

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: They add an
average of 11 minutes

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.154 align:middle line:90%
to our sleep at night.

00:50:36.154 --> 00:50:37.570 align:middle line:84%
That's what studies
have revealed.

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it?

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: That's it.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People take that
stuff for 11 extra minutes?

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: However, they
also-- people will

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:49.020 align:middle line:84%
wake feeling like they had
better sleep because they

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.420 align:middle line:90%
reduce anxiety.

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.720 align:middle line:90%
We fall asleep quicker.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And they induce amnesia
so we don't remember

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.090 align:middle line:84%
the tossing and
turning in the night.

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:04.270 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
they reduce the time

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.360 align:middle line:84%
you spend in deep
sleep, which is

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.440 align:middle line:84%
that physically
restorative sleep.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:13.500 align:middle line:84%
That's so important for our
immunity and our well-being.

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And it also reduces
REM sleep, which

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.285 align:middle line:90%
is so emotionally restorative.

00:51:17.285 --> 00:51:19.540 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that dreaming is
working out our problems.

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:23.062 align:middle line:90%


00:51:23.062 --> 00:51:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So any deep sleep
is really kind of knocked

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:26.664 align:middle line:90%
out when you're on those drugs.

00:51:26.664 --> 00:51:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: Yeah, you
have less of it.

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have less of it.

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And as we age we
get less and less deep sleep

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:35.960 align:middle line:84%
in general, which is why
we show signs of aging,

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.880 align:middle line:84%
everything from wrinkled skin to
weakened muscle, memory lapse.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:46.250 align:middle line:84%
All of it is a function of
getting less deep sleep.

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So if someone is chronically
every night taking

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:54.620 align:middle line:84%
a benzodiazepine or
a non-benzodiazepine,

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:57.460 align:middle line:84%
both of them have this
effect of reducing

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.905 align:middle line:90%
the time in the deep sleep.

00:51:58.905 --> 00:51:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are
non-- That's Ambien.

00:51:59.910 --> 00:52:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Non-benzodiazepine.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: That would be like
Ambien and Lunesta and those,

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:05.790 align:middle line:90%
the non-benzodiazepines.

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:11.280 align:middle line:84%
They are not as addictive
as the benzodiazepines,

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.500 align:middle line:84%
although there are
many people who say,

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and I know many people who
say, I cannot sleep without

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.910 align:middle line:90%
my Ambien or my Lunesta.

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So there is some level of
accommodation at least.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But when it reduces
that time in deep sleep,

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.100 align:middle line:84%
it's actually sort of
accelerating our aging.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And the long-term
mortality studies

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:41.330 align:middle line:84%
suggest that it actually
shortens the life span as well.

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
antihistamines?

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Benadryl?

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:45.364 align:middle line:90%
That's a famous one.

00:52:45.364 --> 00:52:45.946 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: It is.

00:52:45.946 --> 00:52:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Over-the-counter
stuff, like Unisom--

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.142 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yeah.

00:52:49.142 --> 00:52:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --what happens when
you're taking antihistamines?

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: I'm not as familiar
with the antihistamines,

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.080 align:middle line:84%
because they aren't
as commonly used.

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: And one of
the things that I

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.760 align:middle line:84%
want to make a point of
in talking about this

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:07.630 align:middle line:84%
is that I can totally empathize
with people's desire to sleep.

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And we read so much about
the deleterious effects

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.660 align:middle line:84%
of not getting enough sleep that
I understand why people would

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.380 align:middle line:90%
turn to any kind of sleep aid.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And also there are
times in our lives

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:26.920 align:middle line:84%
when we are traumatized, when
we've had a grievous loss, when

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.690 align:middle line:84%
there's a real need for
something to help us to sleep,

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not putting
down those things.

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just that these studies
have indicated for decades now

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:41.670 align:middle line:84%
that the best way
to get better sleep

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:46.290 align:middle line:84%
is to simply arrange your
life around your sleep

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:48.740 align:middle line:90%
a little better more.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't read those
emails late at night.

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Yes, absolutely.

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Make sure it's cool
enough but not too cold.

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Make sure it's dark enough.

00:53:56.450 --> 00:54:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Make sure it's-- Just
hold it as important.

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how
many people who've

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.900 align:middle line:84%
read the book have
said to me, you

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.670 align:middle line:84%
don't give any advice
about how to sleep,

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:09.205 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sleeping
so much better now.

00:54:09.205 --> 00:54:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Because you talk about--

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: Because they're
paying attention to it.

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --the lifestyle.

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:13.285 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:54:13.285 --> 00:54:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: They're
paying attention.

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Attention is so powerful.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Just by attending to something,
we allow it to thrive.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
finally, you say you

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.600 align:middle line:84%
wonder what it would be like
if we really could truly

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:29.770 align:middle line:84%
walk between those waking and
sleeping world with awareness

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:30.720 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Oh, yes.

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:33.250 align:middle line:90%
I do wonder that.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder what
sleep would have

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:36.840 align:middle line:90%
to say about our day lives.

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:40.660 align:middle line:10%
We from our day life perspective
have a lot to say about sleep,

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.550 align:middle line:10%
but what would
sleep say about us?

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:48.470 align:middle line:10%
And I think that sleep would say
that fortunately they're around

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:53.780 align:middle line:10%
every night to help repair
the damage we create by day.

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We create by day.

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So we need to start
respecting that.

00:54:57.270 --> 00:55:00.830 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop buying into the
whole Western way of thinking

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.740 align:middle line:84%
you snooze, you
lose, the early bird

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.140 align:middle line:90%
gets the worm, and so forth.

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: All of those.

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're already seeing--

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: The best don't rest.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the best don't
rest-- the destructive elements

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.450 align:middle line:84%
of that way of living
in our culture at large.

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
honoring sleep

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:15.680 align:middle line:84%
might be one of the
quickest paths to reversing

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.110 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that damage
collectively and individually?

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DUFF: Absolutely.

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.832 align:middle line:84%
The carbon footprint
of sleep is very small.

00:55:23.832 --> 00:55:24.582 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:55:24.582 --> 00:55:26.589 align:middle line:84%
Kat, thank you so much
for all of your hard work

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:27.630 align:middle line:90%
and sharing this with us.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DUFF: Thank you
very much, Regina.

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the
title of the book

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.040 align:middle line:84%
is "The Secret Life
of Sleep," which

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.160 align:middle line:84%
is available through
all major booksellers.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.260 align:middle line:10%
