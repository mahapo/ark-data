>>CYNDI DALE: I'm
not the first person

00:00:10.653 --> 00:00:12.970 align:middle line:84%
to say, hey, eat for
your chakra type.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.059 align:middle line:84%
I work with a 12-chakra
system because I saw

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.380 align:middle line:90%
those chakras when I was a kid.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I just find people are so
much more successful eating

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.338 align:middle line:90%
for their type.

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: It's kind of
like your own divine genius--

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Totally.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --is what
constitutes the 12th chakra.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I say pick a chakra and go
through it if you're a mystic.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:84%
The Earth itself is linked
to your bone marrow,

It's all about carbs
for the second chakra.

00:00:41.377 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
If you're happy, you
might go for the carbs.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
If you're not happy, you
might go for the carbs.

>>REGINA: Miss Sunshine herself,
Cyndi Dale, is back with us

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.940 align:middle line:84%
with an incredibly
useful way to understand

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:90%
how to use the chakra system.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:10%
Her new book is titled
"Chakras, Food and You".

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look at
how your primary chakra can

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:84%
help you determine the best
choices in the food you eat.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.127 align:middle line:84%
And I personally can't wait
to hear more about this,

00:01:21.127 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and I know every one of
us wants to hear ourselves

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:90%
in this story.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Cyndi.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Thank you.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.450 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of those people
who love those paper

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
pencil quizzes, and I get to go,
oh, I'm this kind of a person.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It's really valuable,
actually, for decision-making.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
made one of those.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You have one
of those in this book

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:10%
so people can determine
what kind they are.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.580 align:middle line:10%
But I think even in
this conversation,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:10%
when we start looking at sort
of archetypal personality

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:10%
traits, you--

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:10%
people can even before
they take the test start

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.320 align:middle line:10%
tapping into maybe
a bit who they

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:10%
are before they get the
information out of the book.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:90%
So this will be useful.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And you might not even
need to take the quiz,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:84%
because lots of times we can
just look at the descriptions

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:90%
and go, there I am.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.897 align:middle line:84%
Or if that's not working, get a
friend to tell you who you are.

00:02:05.897 --> 00:02:06.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what I tell people.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's true.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: They know us better
than we know ourself.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're honest with
yourself, your friends will be.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Let them just say, you are that.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Remember the cranky part?

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:90%
You're the cranky chakra person.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you say this
is based on understanding

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.453 align:middle line:90%
what our primary chakra is.

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:84%
We touched on this
in another interview,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
but let's go ahead
and refresh for people

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:90%
who didn't see that interview.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So chakras are
subtle energy organs,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.267 align:middle line:84%
and I work with a
12-chakra system

00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:84%
because I saw those chakras when
I was a kid, so it made sense

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
to put that together
into something

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:90%
accessible for people.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
But our soul typically needs
to play through or work

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.280 align:middle line:84%
through one chakra
more than others,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.582 align:middle line:90%
which just sort of makes sense.

00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm going to be an
opera singer, which I'm not,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's
happy that I'm not,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
I need to really operate
through my fifth chakra, which

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:90%
is in the throat.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that's
about communication.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to be a football
player, which I'm not and have

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
never been, then you're
going to want to have access

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:90%
to your first chakra.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:90%
That's physical.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the one in the hip area.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So the soul is very,
very wise, and before it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
commits all the way, it goes,
let's turn that chakra on.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm really going to
need access to that.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be an accountant.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I need my third chakra.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:90%
That's the thinking chakra.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we change a
little bit as time goes on,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
so one chakra may sort
of turn off a little bit,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and another go into
that primary space.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But where we are
right now, we have

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:90%
more or less a primary chakra.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How do we--

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
someone listening to
this, how are they

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:84%
going to ascertain what
their primary chakra is?

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, the easiest
way is to have a sense

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:90%
of each of the major chakras.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I have labels for them, kind
of what the qualities are

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.033 align:middle line:84%
that are related to each chakra,
so I can just review those.

00:03:58.033 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's do it.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I have some-- I wrote them down
here too, so I've got them.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Excellent.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:90%
You've got them too.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So I'll just go--

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:90%
I'll read along with you.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Excellent.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about it,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
because before
anything else, I'd

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:84%
really like everyone watching
to be able to find themselves

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:84%
in this story before we
drill down into the food part

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:84%
of it, which is very near
and dear to most women,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.545 align:middle line:84%
and we have a lot
of women watching.

00:04:16.545 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We love food.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:90%
We love sugar.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.018 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We love food.

00:04:19.018 --> 00:04:20.260 align:middle line:90%
We love food, and I love--

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.135 align:middle line:90%
you and I love sugar.

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We've established that.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.407 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to tell
people not to do that, OK?

00:04:25.407 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
don't have to worry--

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You don't
have to tune out now.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:90%
So first chakra is red.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:90%
It's in the hip.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the location
of the manifester.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:90%
And these are the people who--

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:84%
very adrenal-based-- are
all about moving, doing,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:84%
accomplishing,
never sitting still.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.628 align:middle line:90%
So you know who you are.

00:04:43.628 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:84%
You know if your kids are a
manifester, because they're

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:90%
the ones that never sit still.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So they're the movers and the
shakers, the trailblazers.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Second chakra, creators.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
In the abdomen, that's
an orange chakra.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I say the word
creator, but we should

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:84%
be singing the Barry Manilow
song "Feelings", (SINGING)

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.617 align:middle line:90%
nothing more than feelings.

00:05:04.617 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So you know
if you're a feeler,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:84%
the thinkers are related
to the third chakra.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:90%
That's in the solar plexus.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:90%
It's yellow.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And that pretty much describes
this personality; very

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.770 align:middle line:84%
structured, organized,
doing things on time,

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:90%
love your calendar.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:84%
If it's not in your
calendar, you know,

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
it could cause you
a bit of stress.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You really stop
and consider, and analyze,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:90%
and make clear decisions.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Wisely.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:90%
With data.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
not me, by the way.

00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's not me, either.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
If you can file, you
might be a thinker.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If you enjoy filing--

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You're
definitely a thinker.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So fourth chakra,
that's the relater position.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's all
about love, relationship.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:84%
A lot of relaters are healers
in one capacity or another.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
people who really do

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.120 align:middle line:90%
understand it's all about love.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Walk into a room, and
knows who's seeing who,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
who should be seeing
who, who's seeing who

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:90%
and who shouldn't be seeing who.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're all
about relationship.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's relater.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Fifth chakra, blue, in the
throat, the communicator.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Thinking, musing,
philosophizing,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.252 align:middle line:84%
reading, listening
to music, talking.

00:06:22.252 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, and a
lot of people think

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
that communicators by
dint of the explanation

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
need to be extroverts,
but you don't have to be.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:84%
You might be an
introverted communicator,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
like you're thinking
about people.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:90%
You're philosophizing.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
You're looking for
higher ideas and ideals,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
or you're listening
to music all the time.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's a communicator
personality, all right?

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's go up to the sixth chakra.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:90%
It's violet.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:90%
It's in the brow.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:90%
It's the home of the visualizer.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Visualizers are often
clairvoyant, also.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.875 align:middle line:90%
They get pictures.

00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
They understand the world
through the pictures they

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
get in dreams, or in
their imaginations,

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.100 align:middle line:90%
but they're very aesthetic.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So visualizers tend
to dress well often.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:90%
That's a tip for visualizers.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
visualizers would have

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.580 align:middle line:90%
dressed well even during COVID.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.968 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's a big hint.

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:84%
People who still put nice
clothing on to go out.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Not me.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.575 align:middle line:84%
I have to come here to get
dressed in a nice outfit.

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Get out
of your sweats.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, and it's
another hint about, you know,

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:84%
if you want to go
out and exercise, put

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:90%
on a great-looking yoga outfit.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.352 align:middle line:84%
So you use your traits wisely,
but you're really aesthetic.

00:07:35.352 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
All right, that's who you are
and that's what you're about.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
sixth chakra, brow.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.653 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: That's the
sixth chakra, brow.

00:07:40.653 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's jump to the white
energy center, seventh chakra,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
top of the head,
the spiritualist.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I just think that name
describes that persona.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:90%
You're spiritual.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:90%
You're pure.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:84%
You're devoted or a
beautiful devotee.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But it could sound
like spiritualists

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.680 align:middle line:84%
could be just sort of, you
know, sort of weak-minded.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Not so.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be
very devoted, too.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.610 align:middle line:90%
Justice, right, wrong.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:84%
They can pick up a
liar three blocks away.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Like, that person's
not telling the truth.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
They're not in accordance
to who they really are.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's the spiritualist.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:84%
They're good
meditators, by the way.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's another ding
if you're a spiritualist.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.128 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going out of body.

00:08:28.128 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:90%
All right, not literally.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people,
like, drifting off

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.799 align:middle line:84%
to the moon, which we could
do in some of these shows,

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:90%
or at least in my world.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Eighth chakra, above the
head, also in the thymus.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
It's black or silver
or a combination.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:90%
This is the home of the mystic.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Shamans, mystics, you're
the otherworldly picture.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:84%
We're both smiling because
we relate to this one.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:90%
This is the soul of it.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Even when you were young,
you knew there was more.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:84%
You knew there was
something under the bed,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:90%
but it could have been an angel.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that it was,
like, sort of a nasty.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So mystics are
very, very attuned

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.835 align:middle line:84%
to what is not always
tuned into in this world.

00:09:08.835 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
non-physical realm.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.293 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's non-physical.

00:09:11.293 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:90%
It's interdimensional.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's just who you are.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:90%
You've always been that way.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So you might have been the weird
one in the family growing up,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.750 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're going to jump
up about a foot and a half

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:90%
over the head.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:90%
This is a gold chakra.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I call these ninth chakra
people harmonizers.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.065 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be a
lovely thing to be?

00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:32.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:32.865 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I'm not
particularly harmonic.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I cause more
problems than I cure,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:84%
but there are people who
by nature are harmonic.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:90%
They're idealists.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.520 align:middle line:84%
They're the people
who could, like,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:84%
sing that song "I Want to
Teach the World to Sing".

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:84%
They're always devoted
to a beautiful cause,

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and they really
don't like it when

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.290 align:middle line:90%
there's fray or argumentation.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing the
world together right now.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:84%
These, especially
young people, I

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
believe are here to save
the world right now, right?

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we've got to
get everybody talking.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:84%
We have to get people
on the same side.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:90%
We have to help this world.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:90%
That's a harmonizer, all right?

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going to nose dive--

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there a
color associated with--

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Gold.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Gold, thank you.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And that fits for
harmonizers, too.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, high, advanced color.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:90%
So I'm really glad you asked.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:84%
10th chakra, brown,
underneath the ground

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:90%
about a foot and a half or so.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the home
of the naturalist.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So you already know if
you're a naturalist.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.817 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're that
down to earth--

00:10:35.817 --> 00:10:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You live for the dirt.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You live for the dirt.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, some people do the sky.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not gossip, the dirt.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:90%
The real dirt.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you know
the dirt is coming

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:90%
from animals or the stars.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Trees, animals,
plants, landscaping, Feng Shui,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:90%
astrology.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the cosmos.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:90%
And organic, natural.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And it can sound really
easy to be a naturalist,

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.300 align:middle line:84%
but some naturalists
struggle because you

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:90%
know what animals are feeling.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:84%
You know what's happening
in the climate right now.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.380 align:middle line:84%
You know what the
plants are going through

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
while they're suffering
with fires, et cetera.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's your basic
core personality.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:25.010 align:middle line:84%
There's one more chakra that has
a personality ascribed to it.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the commander
personality, 11th chakra.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:90%
It's in the energy field.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It's also found kind
of really heavily

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:90%
around the hands and the feet.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So think about the
word commander,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:90%
right, commander in chief.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of natural
leaders are commanders.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:90%
People just follow them.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.490 align:middle line:90%
They listen to them.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And some are called
politicians, and some are nice,

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:90%
and some aren't.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So what are the
personality traits

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:90%
that surround the commander?

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Leadership.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Leadership.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, they just have
natural leadership capability.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Leadership.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Take charge.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:90%
People believe you.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:84%
There's another subset,
however, and they're

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:90%
more like sorcerers.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So in indigenous
populations, the commander

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:84%
was also somebody maybe who
was followed by the living,

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:90%
but maybe also by the dead.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
They can command, if
they learn how to,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.890 align:middle line:84%
supernatural energies
as well as natural, too.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we all
have a 12th chakra.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I usually access it in the
middle of my heart chakra,

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.060 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't
really have a typing.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
We have very instinctive,
innate, beautiful, unique gifts

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
in our 12th chakra, so
that's where we really

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:84%
want to have some fun and spin,
and go what makes me really

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.700 align:middle line:90%
different than anyone else?

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
maybe, it's-- like,

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I have one client who could
write stories and the ending

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:90%
came true.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.783 align:middle line:90%
That was her 12th chakra gift.

00:12:51.783 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's kind of
like your own divine genius--

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Totally.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --is what
constitutes the 12th chakra.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.072 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:12:59.072 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That unique thing
that you brought forward.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.782 align:middle line:84%
So it's different,
obviously, for everyone.

00:13:04.782 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's different
for absolutely everybody

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:90%
in every way.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, does it
even relate to a food?

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:84%
No, it doesn't need to, because
when we get to be who we are,

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe we instinctively
make healthier choices anyway.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So kind of going down that path
of going what makes me special?

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, what did people
even love about me growing up

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.420 align:middle line:90%
or make fun about me growing up?

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.240 align:middle line:84%
That might be your
specialness right there.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Giving
people that outlet.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:35.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now, you've
just gone through the chakras,

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and most of the chakras are
associated with either a gland

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:90%
or an organ.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, this refines
it a little more,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
because as we get to
the food, sometimes,

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:84%
like, foods that are good for
people with kidney issues,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.260 align:middle line:90%
for example--

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's go-- let's just
quickly go through the organs

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:84%
or glands that are--
these primary chakras are.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Excellent, because
we're drilling down,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and there is some
emerging science that's

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:84%
saying there's a
certain way to eat

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
to support the adrenals
versus the pancreas

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:90%
versus the pituitary gland.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So someday, doctors will come
up with a program like this,

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and then it'll be even more
refined, which is terrific.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:84%
For chakra manifester,
adrenals, all right?

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Second chakra, creators,
ovaries or testes.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Third chakra, that's
your solar plexus.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:90%
That's your thinker type.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the pancreas, right,
blood sugar, et cetera.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Fourth chakra, relater, heart.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.020 align:middle line:84%
The physical organ of the heart
is actually an endocrine gland.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:90%
It produces hormones.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Fifth chakra in the throat
area, that's your communicator.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:90%
There's your thyroid.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Sixth chakra, visualizer,
up in the brow,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:90%
that's the pituitary gland.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle line:84%
That's a master gland that
runs just about everything.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Seventh chakra,
spiritualist, pineal gland.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.064 align:middle line:84%
That's your
spiritual gland, too.

00:15:04.064 --> 00:15:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Eighth chakra, that's
the one above the head

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.100 align:middle line:90%
and in the thymus.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the thymus gland, which
is an immune gland, which

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.060 align:middle line:84%
shrinks in most of us
as we're growing up,

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:90%
so that's fascinating.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And actually, medically-- OK,
I'm being nerdy right now,

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
but medically,
doctors are starting

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.493 align:middle line:84%
to use different medications
to enhance people's thymus

00:15:25.493 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:84%
glands because
they're finding out

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:84%
they're so important
for your health.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
was going to say

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:30.672 align:middle line:90%
they're very little spoken of.

00:15:30.672 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
You go to the
doctor, they'll never

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.525 align:middle line:90%
talk about your thymus gland.

00:15:33.525 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Nope.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.942 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then you
hear about certain systems

00:15:35.942 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:84%
where tapping the thymus
gland, for example,

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:90%
starts to activate it.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Tell us more about it.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:84%
This is an important gland
we don't know enough about.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's very important.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.060 align:middle line:84%
When you're younger, it
really is a huge factor

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:90%
of your immune system.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
I've had children.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:90%
You have children.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I still-- we still
have children, right?

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:84%
But those young ages
are sick all the time.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:84%
They're supposed to be, because
they're gaining immunity.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And the thymus gland
is really working

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:84%
to help you develop certain
aspects of your antibodies

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.760 align:middle line:90%
and to get the immune system on.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, I
recognize that microbe.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to fell me again.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
The thymus gland tends
to shrink, though,

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.952 align:middle line:84%
by the time we're about
12, 15, or this or that.

00:16:18.952 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
already set the template

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:90%
for the immune system?

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:90%
It has, but it shrinks.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if anybody
really knows why.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's
because we don't use--

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.800 align:middle line:84%
personally, I believe it's
because we're not using

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.472 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual function of it.

00:16:33.472 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the spiritual function.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, the thymus
gland for everybody,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.970 align:middle line:84%
not just eighth chakra
mystics, connects to your soul.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:90%
And your soul feeds it.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It nurtures it.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Your soul issues often run
through your eighth chakra

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:90%
and also your thymus gland.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And various esoteric
orders talk about

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that your soul is connected
through a silver cord

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.620 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in the
neck, the shoulders.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it also goes
through the thymus gland,

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and so if we're not
accentuating our soul, which

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:84%
we don't in our Western culture,
if we're not even telling kids

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.025 align:middle line:90%
you have a soul--

00:17:11.025 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have a soul--

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.440 align:middle line:90%
then it would atrophy.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And in so many different
cultures, by about 12, 13,

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
young people are going
out on vision quests.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:90%
They're doing moon ceremonies.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:84%
They're doing
something that helps

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:84%
them access their soul to
figure out their sole purpose.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But we're just throwing
them to junior high.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I mean, I hated
those years, you know?

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And saying good luck
with history, right?

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.808 align:middle line:90%
And you've got braces.

00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to be popular.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And pimples.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: And pimples.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're too tall, you're
too this, you're too that.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not
developing the soul.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
So my own theory is that thymus
gland shrinks because we're not

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:84%
getting attention to our soul
during those early puberty

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, next one up.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Ninth chakra, gold, over
the head, in the diaphragm.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Now technically,
the diaphragm is yet

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:84%
to be proven to be an endocrine
gland, but it is an organ,

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:90%
and it's incredibly important.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.015 align:middle line:84%
Look at how many
cultures talk about

00:18:13.015 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that the spiritualization of
your body and your good health

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.670 align:middle line:90%
is about breathing correctly.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's all about
your breathing.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:84%
That's all about
bringing in life energy,

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:90%
nature energy, spirit energy.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you're doing
through that diaphragm as well.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.440 align:middle line:84%
All right, so 10th chakra, we're
going down underneath the feet.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Now this I'm fascinated by,
because that 10th chakra, which

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.110 align:middle line:84%
is the naturalist, it's
connected to your ancestry,

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth itself.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It is linked to
your bone marrow,

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:47.220 align:middle line:90%
which is a hormone gland.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when we undergo
stress, most people

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.610 align:middle line:84%
go, oh, the poor
adrenals go on, right?

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.380 align:middle line:90%
And then everything catapults.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a hormone
called osteocalcin

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:84%
in bone marrow that tell
the adrenals and the rest

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
of your nervous system that
you're in fright, flight,

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:90%
freeze, et cetera, all right?

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So the bone marrow is really
associated, I believe,

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:84%
with your ancestors' memories,
and your connective tissue

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.780 align:middle line:90%
to some extent, too.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very interesting
that naturalists are really

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:84%
connected to ancestry, to Earth,
to bone marrow, which produces

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:84%
stem cells, different
kind of immune cells.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.003 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
one of the cure-alls

00:19:34.003 --> 00:19:36.420 align:middle line:84%
of the future is knowing how
to work with the bone marrow.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I really believe that.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we're
ending at the 10th.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: That's the
10th, but there's 11th.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh really?

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yep, 11th.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a gland
associated with that?

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: 11th.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, and it's
sort of like a gland.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
connective tissue itself.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So it sort of blurs
a bit into the bone marrow,

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.100 align:middle line:84%
but you know,
connective tissue has

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:84%
been shown in so many
studies these days

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:90%
to hold your memories.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to say.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Inflammation.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Fascia.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:90%
Inflammation.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:84%
When people get autoimmune
dysfunctions, very common,

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:84%
chronic pain, addictive
tendencies, I mean,

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:84%
your connective tissues are
really involved with that,

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and so you're
talking 11th chakra.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So for anybody, not even if
you're just an 11th chakra

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:84%
person, you're saying, oh my
gosh, am I empowered enough?

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Am I-- do I know I have a voice?

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Do I know I can take command?

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Do I know that there's
supernatural qualities

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:90%
that I can move around?

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So a little clue for all of
us that we all want to sort of

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:84%
tap a little bit into
that 11th chakra.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you are the
leader type, you're

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:90%
going to have to do that.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we get into one of
our favorite subjects, foods.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Food.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, how did you
put all of this together first,

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
before we go into
the specifics of it?

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: You know, I started
working with this 25 years ago,

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, sort
of like privately

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:90%
and observing clients.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that clients
had primary chakras,

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and that there were certain
foods that were good for them

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the science
started to come

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that said, hey, if
you're an adrenal person,

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:90%
you need to eat this way.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of started to
dovetail that I noticed that

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.110 align:middle line:84%
where we were going in
our culture, in science,

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:84%
where other chakra experts were
already going-- because they--

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the first person to say,
hey, eat for your chakra type.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.105 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I mean,
that's out there.

00:21:37.105 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Just Google it and you'll
find 2,500 sites telling you

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not a mystery.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:10%
You know, and what I'd
been putting together

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:10%
when I was developing
the 12th chakra system

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:10%
and even teaching chakra
types to businesses,

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.290 align:middle line:10%
to business people.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And saying, if you kind of treat
your main chakra really well,

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
naturally healthier.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:90%
So it really just came together.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was just timely
to have this material come out

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea COVID
was going to happen.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: But it did.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.732 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
why it's so important,

00:22:09.732 --> 00:22:12.650 align:middle line:84%
because people were thrown
so out of balance with COVID.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the stats my
husband and I read

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:84%
was that the average weight
gain of adults in America

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:90%
was 29 pounds.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But then I started looking
around a little bit more,

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and I saw a lot of teenage
girls who had become really,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.125 align:middle line:84%
really plump, for
example; couldn't

00:22:32.125 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:84%
go out with their friends
and do what they normally

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:38.250 align:middle line:84%
do, just home eating to soothe
the anxiety and separation.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:90%
So we ate a lot of carbs.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.273 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, carbs are
comfort no matter who you are.

00:22:43.273 --> 00:22:45.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Boost serotonin when
you're depressed and isolated.

00:22:45.815 --> 00:22:46.615 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So now--

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.145 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And boys weren't
able to exercise.

00:22:50.145 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same thing.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Same with girls.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
started plumping up, too.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we
have kind of a crisis

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.940 align:middle line:84%
globally of people who were
not eating for their type.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:84%
They're eating one type,
carbs, carbs, carbs,

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:84%
to help with the
distress of it all.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And now we have to start
pulling it back and finding

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:90%
some balance again.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really good
time to be doing this.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's a really good time.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And I just find people are so
much more successful eating

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
for their type than ticking down
the paleo, intermittent this,

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.048 align:middle line:90%
just drink green tea.

00:23:22.048 --> 00:23:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what's
out there anymore.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I just stopped paying attention,
because every other day there

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:90%
was another diet or book.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.312 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I grew up in
the grapefruit diet.

00:23:31.312 --> 00:23:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Like, that lasted for one day
that I did a grapefruit diet.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I did that
too in my teens.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I did the grapefruit
diet, and I fainted.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.350 align:middle line:84%
That was not enough to get
by on as a teenage girl.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.517 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You can't do it, no.

00:23:43.517 --> 00:23:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And I went for a
year before I really

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
ate for my type several
years ago thinking

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I should really be a vegan,
which I support wholeheartedly

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:90%
ethically.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And I ate like a vegan,
and I fainted all the time,

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:90%
because it's not my type.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
now let's use you

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:84%
before we get into
everybody else.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So you are-- your natural
habitat is the eighth chakra.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It is.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It is, but--

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.803 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that.

00:24:07.803 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Eighth chakra is tough,
because when you're a mystic,

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
you have access to
all the chakras.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And so you could
be eating for any

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:84%
of the chakras at
any moment, right?

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm an emotional.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do the cravings
for the second chakra

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:84%
creator, which are carbs
and pizza and muffins.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I love carbs,
pizza, and muffins.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're stressed
in a certain way

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're a
mystic, you're going

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.567 align:middle line:84%
to go through your third
chakra, your thinker,

00:24:32.567 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to crunch.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.210 align:middle line:90%
You're going to do popcorn.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So I say pick a chakra and go
through it if you're a mystic.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I did several years ago.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I picked the first
chakra, because I fit it.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm very physical.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're a busy bunny.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.923 align:middle line:90%
You just keep going.

00:24:47.923 --> 00:24:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I don't sit down.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We first chakra types, we keep
going and then we crash, right?

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:90%
And we don't talk.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
an eighth chakra

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.080 align:middle line:90%
person behaving like a first.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: As a first chakra.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And I like being a
first chakra person.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.110 align:middle line:90%
I get a lot done.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:90%
I clean.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.428 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my house is clean.

00:25:06.428 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even with dogs.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Even the dogs.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're kind
of first chakra,

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:84%
too, so they're messing it
up while I'm cleaning it up.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So I eat like a first chakra
person, which is adrenals.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:90%
it's red.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:90%
It's hip.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Mainly due protein.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:90%
I love protein.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:90%
I go high minerals.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I do lots of vegetables,
very little fruit.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.370 align:middle line:84%
If I do fruit, I have to
have the darker fruit,

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.560 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise
it's going to spike me

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to get crazed
and do stupid things or crash.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I honestly do the veggies
and the protein kind of thing.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And chocolate?

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Chocolate's
really on my diet.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:90%
It's way up there.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:44.840 align:middle line:90%
It's my third food.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.770 align:middle line:90%
It's carb.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.363 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: And you know what?

00:25:47.363 --> 00:25:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I heartily believe in
picking your cheats,

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:84%
because studies do
show that if you

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:84%
have a positive attitude when
you're a little off your food

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
list, you know, when you're
doing that piece of chocolate

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.225 align:middle line:84%
cake-- which I will do a piece
of chocolate cake every so

00:26:04.225 --> 00:26:05.025 align:middle line:90%
often.

00:26:05.025 --> 00:26:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I'm
pretty gluten free.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm just not into
gluten that much either.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, I could do a good
muffin every so often, right?

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a positive
attitude and you're like,

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happily eating
this piece of chocolate,

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:90%
it's really not going to stick.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:84%
It ain't going to
affix to the hips.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.507 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to,
like, wear you down.

00:26:25.507 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:90%
You're going to work it through.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:84%
You're going to digest it
is what's going to happen.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:90%
I do eat chocolate.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.810 align:middle line:90%
I like chocolate.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I keep it limited,
but you know, I'm

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:84%
at a point where I can
even keep a milk chocolate.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't do dark chocolate.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:90%
I do milk chocolate.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.038 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to eat what
you want, eat what you want.

00:26:43.038 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
I can keep a bar in the house
and I just eat a piece a day.

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:90%
That's all I do.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.980 align:middle line:10%
I tend to eat it after I do
a meal so it doesn't kind

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:10%
of spike me, because
we first chakra types,

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.190 align:middle line:10%
we like to eat lots of food.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Like, we ignore food
until it's time to eat.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:04.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:04.865 --> 00:27:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Everything you're saying I
could almost say for myself.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You relate.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I relate to all of it.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.740 align:middle line:90%
I go to my sisters' house--

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I can eat on
the run really well.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll go over to her house,
and it'll be noon or so,

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and she'll say, have you
eaten anything yet today?

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:17.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally forgot.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I'm the guy in the
movies that makes the food

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and eats it right
out of the pan.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.160 align:middle line:90%
I actually only own two pans.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:26.960 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:84%
My youngest son
is a great chef--

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one serves
as your serving plate.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yep.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:90%
My youngest son is not who I am.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's very second
chakra also, very feeling.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe when he's
home how many pots and pans.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:84%
He brings them
home from college,

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.412 align:middle line:84%
because he's like, mom, I
can't cook with your pan.

00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what's
wrong with my pan?

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.707 align:middle line:90%
He goes, it's 20 years. old.

00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And sometimes you
need more than just the pan.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, you do.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
first chakra person,

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.407 align:middle line:84%
that covers you as an eighth
chakra person that has chosen--

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And my choice
of first chakra.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --choice
of first chakra

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:90%
because it works for you.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It works for me.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let's
move to the second.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.190 align:middle line:84%
We've covered the eighth,
and we've covered the first.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.065 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, we have.

00:28:05.065 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now we go
to the second chakra, emotion

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:90%
or feeling person.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Emotion, feeling.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And your big challenge--
well, your cravings

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.660 align:middle line:84%
are all going to be
based on your feelings.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you're happy, you might go
for the muffins, for the carbs.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.737 align:middle line:84%
It's all about carbs
for the second chakra.

00:28:21.737 --> 00:28:23.570 align:middle line:84%
If you're happy, you
might go for the carbs.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
If you're not happy, you
might go for the carbs.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So the thing to learn if
you're a second chakra person

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.280 align:middle line:90%
is how to pick the right carbs.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So typically, even if you're
not gluten sensitive or kind of

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:84%
allergic to it, it's easiest
to feed yourself well,

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:84%
if you're second
chakra, if you just

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.670 align:middle line:84%
decide I'm not going
to go for the gluten.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to limit my
carbs to whole carbs.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do brown rice.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
healthier ones.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to work
with my feelings.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to deal with
my feelings before I eat.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.600 align:middle line:90%
That's really the clue.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.727 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, instead of using
food to alter your feelings.

00:29:03.727 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Eat your feelings,
to alter your feelings.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
a challenging one.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's the hardest one.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would think so.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.067 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I think second chakra
is the most challenging one.

00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:90%
I really think it is.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they are
naturally inclined toward--

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.573 align:middle line:84%
but in what you're saying would
also naturally thrive by carbs

00:29:19.573 --> 00:29:20.990 align:middle line:84%
if they're the
right quality carb.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:84%
If you eat the right quality
of carbs, you're great.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:84%
If you can do the
whole grains, you

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:84%
know, whether it's gluten free
and it's spelt or brown rice,

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.490 align:middle line:84%
or you do do gluten
and you just have

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.820 align:middle line:84%
that nice, big,
thick piece of bread,

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:84%
but you partner it
with good omega-3s

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:90%
so that you're filling yourself.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.550 align:middle line:90%
You can do fruit.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.100 align:middle line:90%
You can do veggies.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to tend to
hang out in the carb corner,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.880 align:middle line:90%
so pick good carbs.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And sprinkle good
foods in there.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Put some blueberries in there,
you know, like feed yourself

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.010 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes sense
and then those carbs

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.120 align:middle line:84%
are going to soothe
and balance--

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.660 align:middle line:90%
help you balance your emotions.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now we go
to the mind, number three.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:01.993 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: The thinker.

00:30:01.993 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The thinker.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, the big
key with thinkers,

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.020 align:middle line:90%
they're linked to the pancreas.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, the pancreas
is all about blood sugar.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So your thinker is
going to get out of control.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And thinkers hate
being out of control,

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:90%
because they're very structured.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.790 align:middle line:84%
They'll get out of control
if their schedule is out

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.130 align:middle line:84%
of control, if their
thoughts are out of control,

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:84%
if they're getting a
little bit too negative

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:24.590 align:middle line:84%
or somehow they get
off their schedule.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.627 align:middle line:84%
And their pancreas, then,
will go up and down,

00:30:26.627 --> 00:30:27.710 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to crave.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.340 align:middle line:84%
You're going to crave
candy bars, crunch foods.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.570 align:middle line:90%
They love popcorn.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.813 align:middle line:90%
Beer if you're so inclined.

00:30:34.813 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:84%
If you hate your
job, you're going

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.720 align:middle line:90%
to go for caffeine, sodas.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.520 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.230 align:middle line:84%
All which are good
foods, but they're not

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.640 align:middle line:90%
really good in quantity.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, not
for a steady diet.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.330 align:middle line:90%
So mini meals.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:51.230 align:middle line:84%
The key for a thinker, eat
your five or six mini meals

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and mix a good fat with a
good carb with a good protein.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:56.960 align:middle line:90%
And keep your snacks around.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Keep your blood sugar steady.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.525 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to get off base.

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:02.150 align:middle line:84%
You're going to always
have that, like,

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:05.750 align:middle line:84%
good kind of like GORP
product there, right?

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.140 align:middle line:10%
If you leave a meeting and
you're just, like, frustrated,

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:10%
the candy bar machine
is right there.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.690 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.563 align:middle line:84%
Better if you can pull
out of your briefcase--

00:31:14.563 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something
you've created

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.570 align:middle line:84%
this a little more
balanced and still has

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:18.680 align:middle line:90%
that hit of sweet or whatever.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:90%
So think ahead.

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, thinkers
can think ahead.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So they should be
able to manage this.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.003 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They can manage this.

00:31:25.003 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
the easiest thing

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.200 align:middle line:90%
to be, because they're logical.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:30.860 align:middle line:90%
So they would be prepared.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.000 align:middle line:90%
OK, heart.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Heart.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fourth chakra.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Fourth chakra.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Feelings about relationship.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're all about.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:84%
But not just feelings
about relationship.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.190 align:middle line:84%
It's also about faith,
and truth, and hope,

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and these good sort of
spiritual qualities.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So when a relater
is going to eat,

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.960 align:middle line:84%
well, the key is
go Mediterranean.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.020 align:middle line:84%
It's super easy to
know what to do.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
you're going to do it.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Olive oil, avocados,
healthy seafood.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.578 align:middle line:90%
Kind of think Greece.

00:32:02.578 --> 00:32:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Pretend you're in Greece.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Healthy fats.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Healthy fats.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:84%
You can do fats, because when
you're out of balance, like,

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:84%
oh, you just saw the ex
and they were mean to you,

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and they were with somebody
even more attractive than you,

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:17.580 align:middle line:84%
that's going to do your
diet in right there.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.872 align:middle line:90%
It's just not going to go well.

00:32:18.872 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Or you're a healer and you
just gave all your energy away

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:22.340 align:middle line:90%
to somebody else.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:27.740 align:middle line:84%
You're going to want fried
foods, wine, chocolate.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're just
going to want to indulge.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So instead of going
to Five Guys, Burger King

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.260 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, maybe
have a little dish

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that has a little
piece of feta floating

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.200 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit of olive oil.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Goat cheese.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.988 align:middle line:84%
Something like that, where
you're still getting the--

00:32:43.988 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: A beautiful, healthy set
of foods that can include fats.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Hummus is great.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.210 align:middle line:90%
So don't think non-fat.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the absolute
wrong way to go.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, and if you can
eat pasta of some sort,

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.210 align:middle line:84%
gluten-free or not-- there's
pasta made out of artichokes

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.460 align:middle line:90%
It's, like, crazy out there.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I mean,
I'm a first chakra.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't do pasta.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.513 align:middle line:90%
I don't really care about pasta.

00:33:06.513 --> 00:33:08.507 align:middle line:84%
But if you're second
or fourth chakra,

00:33:08.507 --> 00:33:09.590 align:middle line:90%
you're going to like that.

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself that little
dish with the tomato sauce

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and the little
drizzle of olive oil,

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.560 align:middle line:90%
and put some parsley on there.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.100 align:middle line:90%
You know, just eat for you.

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because it seems
like the biggest problem in any

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:29.090 align:middle line:84%
of these types is when
you're caught out,

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.580 align:middle line:84%
you get thrown off
balance, you didn't--

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.430 align:middle line:90%
you're not prepared.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.388 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the right
staples in your house,

00:33:34.388 --> 00:33:36.020 align:middle line:84%
so you're going to
grab at anything

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that's nearby and gives
you a cheap pickup.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's really preparation,
no matter what type you are.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.598 align:middle line:84%
Having things on hand is what
matters-- what's going to help.

00:33:44.598 --> 00:33:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And I have no
problem with people jumping

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.510 align:middle line:84%
into a 7-Eleven as long as
they have the list of what's

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.448 align:middle line:90%
acceptable to buy, right?

00:33:52.448 --> 00:33:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have to be
prepared and know yourself.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Know yourself.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And know where
you'll go off and do poorly.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.138 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, exactly.

00:33:58.138 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we're
at the fifth chakra.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, communicators can be
challenged, because they're

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:90%
very orally fixated.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think they
care what's around.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.550 align:middle line:84%
They're just going to
put it in their mouth.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:14.534 align:middle line:84%
I mean, pencils, pens,
other people's food,

00:34:14.534 --> 00:34:15.409 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:17.951 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't-- that's the
person when you go out to eat,

00:34:17.951 --> 00:34:19.830 align:middle line:90%
they're in your plate, too.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.909 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, but
they're going to tend

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:84%
to go toward
foods-- when they're

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
a little off--
that'll be a little

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.550 align:middle line:90%
on the crunchy and tasty.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.989 align:middle line:90%
They like tasty foods.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to go for,
like, soggy bread pudding.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.000 align:middle line:90%
It's going to have to be tasty.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So eat mineral-rich
foods, because you're

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.460 align:middle line:84%
eating for your thyroid,
and your thyroid

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.389 align:middle line:90%
needs to be stoked.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:42.994 align:middle line:90%
The thyroid and the parathyroid.

00:34:42.994 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Parathyroid is really in
charge of your calcium,

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and you need really
good healthy foods.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.139 align:middle line:90%
So have some of the goat cheese.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Have chunks of cheese.

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.699 align:middle line:84%
Have some organic beef
stick ready for yourself.

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Have that crunchy celery
stick with some hummus

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.230 align:middle line:90%
ready for yourself.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:84%
But you can eat pretty
much any food, but make--

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:08.420 align:middle line:84%
but emphasize the minerals if
you're a fifth chakra person.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so as you
said, fifth chakra people

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.745 align:middle line:84%
might be the ones that
anybody else's plate they see

00:35:15.745 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:84%
go by in the restaurant,
that's what they now want.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's it.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.700 align:middle line:90%
All right, so now sixth chakra.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Sixth
chakra in the brow.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.210 align:middle line:90%
This is your visualizer.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the pituitary.

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you're going
to be a bit hormone adrift

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.690 align:middle line:84%
or victimized by
your hormones, maybe

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:84%
even like the second
chakra, your monthly cycle--

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.800 align:middle line:90%
and men have those, too.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, because
there are certain times

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.400 align:middle line:84%
of the month that you're going
to want this kind of food

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.590 align:middle line:84%
more than this kind of
food, so be aware of that,

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.050 align:middle line:84%
both if you're second
chakra, ovary, testes,

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.090 align:middle line:90%
and you're pituitary, all right.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:55.653 align:middle line:84%
But your sixth chakra person,
your food type is pretty food.

00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:56.570 align:middle line:90%
It's going to matter--

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
of the aesthetic.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: --what it looks like.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you have the
time, even if you

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:84%
learn some shortcuts to
make a-- to plate your food,

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.600 align:middle line:84%
put it on a beautiful plate,
and literally plate it

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.020 align:middle line:84%
like Gordon Ramsay's
going to assess you, OK?

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.980 align:middle line:84%
You can put the healthiest
foods on there and eat them.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Eggs are fine.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.740 align:middle line:90%
If you can do dairy, do dairy.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Fish is great.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Think hormone enriching foods.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But the key for you
to want to eat it

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.130 align:middle line:90%
is that it looks beautiful.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.938 align:middle line:84%
So you're that person, and I
was a little bit like that.

00:36:30.938 --> 00:36:33.230 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to eat that
food that's sort of, like,

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.460 align:middle line:90%
mushy.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like throwing
brown lentils in a bowl.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: No, you're
not going to do that.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:38.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:41.105 align:middle line:84%
And I had a bit of visualizer
growing up, you know,

00:36:41.105 --> 00:36:44.420 align:middle line:84%
the gravy is
touching the carrots?

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
eat either of them.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.800 align:middle line:90%
So make it beautiful.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And your temptation is going
to be, you've seen those, like,

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.720 align:middle line:90%
bakeries.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Everything looks good.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I mean, that's
your temptation.

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:02.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, all right, moving on up to
the seventh chakra, the white.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: The white,
the spiritualist.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the pineal gland,
and it's kind of tough,

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:10.340 align:middle line:84%
because some
spiritualists honestly

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.650 align:middle line:84%
can get so caught up
in being prayerful

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and meditative they could
kind of forget to eat, or not

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.380 align:middle line:84%
care about what they're
eating, because they

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.950 align:middle line:84%
can tend to be more about
spirit or soul than the body.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.750 align:middle line:90%
So you have to watch that.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:27.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to perceive
and really own

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that the body is part of spirit,
that you aren't just having

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.110 align:middle line:90%
a human experience.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.530 align:middle line:90%
You are a human in this realm.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So to not disregard
the physical elements of life.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Don't
disregard the physical.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they'll
grab anything.

00:37:39.605 --> 00:37:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They'll grab anything.

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
really a big priority.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's not a
big priority, yeah.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're not
well-prepared, necessarily--

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's it.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and throw
anything at it that's nearby.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So it's more about
creating the types of food

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:52.910 align:middle line:90%
you like.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:10%
I met a spiritualist
kid one time years ago,

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.260 align:middle line:10%
maybe four years old.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.340 align:middle line:84%
He was this bright
little boy, big glasses.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.450 align:middle line:84%
He only ate almonds,
yogurt, and oranges.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:09.825 align:middle line:84%
He said to eat any other
food is bad for other people.

00:38:09.825 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:84%
He was a spiritualist
kid, a little bit

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:90%
of a harmonizer in there.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, at least it
wasn't just Snicker bars.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: No, it wasn't.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.337 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually
pretty darn healthy.

00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sure he was.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Getting
fats and proteins.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So pick your value
system, you know what I mean?

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.413 align:middle line:90%
And construct from there.

00:38:25.413 --> 00:38:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's go up to those--
we already did the eighth.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We did eighth.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:29.510 align:middle line:90%
We did eighth--

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're
going to the ninth.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: We're going
to the ninth, which

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:90%
idealist, which is diaphragm.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, so one of the things
if you're an idealist,

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.640 align:middle line:84%
what I tend to
recommend-- because they

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.570 align:middle line:84%
do tend to have a cause that's
really important for them,

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:43.280 align:middle line:90%
eat for the cause.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you're anti fisheries,
you're not going to eat fish.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.310 align:middle line:90%
I know it sounds goofy.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:50.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you really need
to put your philosophy--

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You do.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and
passion behind it,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:52.970 align:middle line:90%
your beliefs behind your food.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Or pick your religion,
or your spirituality.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you're really
devoted to the Old Testament,

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.020 align:middle line:84%
pick the Genesis diet,
you know, that is like,

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.790 align:middle line:90%
eat like they did back then.

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're very kind of
prayerful in a Hindu manner,

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.910 align:middle line:90%
eat that diet.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or if you're really
behind the organics movement--

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Totally.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --only eat organic.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You go with it.

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:16.210 align:middle line:90%
You go vegan.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:17.180 align:middle line:90%
You go vegetarian.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.230 align:middle line:90%
You're organic.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.130 align:middle line:84%
You're feeding the
diaphragm, so the key

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.857 align:middle line:84%
is not to eat too
heavily, because you

00:39:24.857 --> 00:39:26.690 align:middle line:84%
know how you just can't
breathe when there's

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.732 align:middle line:90%
too much in your stomach.

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:31.100 align:middle line:84%
It sounds goofy, but
don't eat too heavy.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.958 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to
lose all your energy.

00:39:32.958 --> 00:39:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, that makes sense.

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.120 align:middle line:90%
10th.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: 10th, organic, nature.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:40.550 align:middle line:10%
You can do root
vegetables, nuts,

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:44.180 align:middle line:10%
anything grown close to the
ground, because you're earthy.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.690 align:middle line:10%
And so that's going to be
your instinctive diet anyway.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:51.850 align:middle line:10%
Chemical free, not artificial
sweeteners, this and that

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.510 align:middle line:10%
and the other thing.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:10%
That actually can
strangely be a temptation

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.740 align:middle line:10%
for the seventh
chakra spiritualist.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.730 align:middle line:84%
When they feel off their game,
they may eat artificial foods.

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Twinkies, I hear they
last, like, 58 years.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:90%
But whatever, right?

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:84%
But you can't eat that way
if you're a naturalist.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.460 align:middle line:90%
You just can't.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:11.240 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have to go organic.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.032 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would your
body and soul sick.

00:40:13.032 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It would
make all of you sick.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:16.860 align:middle line:90%
So organic.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 11th.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: 11th chakra is
your connective tissue.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:24.887 align:middle line:84%
Basically,
anti-inflammatory foods.

00:40:24.887 --> 00:40:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.240 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Yeah, because you cannot
afford to have your tissue,

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.640 align:middle line:10%
your muscles inflamed.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really what's
going to slow you down,

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:38.750 align:middle line:84%
is if you go toward more
immune dysfunction, right?

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Or you're, like,
too thick, you know,

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:42.620 align:middle line:90%
you get that tissue too thick.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Anti-inflammatory.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And that pretty much runs you
away from anything processed,

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
but you can be a little bit
more like the first chakra diet.

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.132 align:middle line:84%
You can eat more with
the healthy proteins.

00:40:56.132 --> 00:40:57.590 align:middle line:84%
You can eat a little
bit more fruit

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.950 align:middle line:84%
than the first chakra people
tend to be able to, veggies.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, that
type of thing too.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now--
and also, some people

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.120 align:middle line:90%
have two primary chakras.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They do.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when you
notice that you're just

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.950 align:middle line:84%
equally powerful in these ways,
you just-- what do you do?

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Just fluctuate?

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Blend the diet.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just blend it.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You just fluctuate.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Go back and forth.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes it might
be very convenient to do

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.470 align:middle line:90%
one chakra rather than another.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Like, let's say you're a
thinker and an idealist,

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.630 align:middle line:90%
which isn't uncommon.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're working for
a nonprofit or something,

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.220 align:middle line:84%
but it's an out of
control nonprofit.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Eat your thinker, because
you're going to give yourself

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.090 align:middle line:90%
self-management.

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So you can
look at your lifestyle

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and figure out what's going
to support you the best in how

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.150 align:middle line:90%
you're living also.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, we have a
little bit of time left.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to take two of your
favorite instances-- examples

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.790 align:middle line:84%
of clients, so
this is anecdotal--

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:58.760 align:middle line:84%
where they were totally doing
the wrong thing because they

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.710 align:middle line:84%
thought they should
do this type of diet,

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and then what happened
when they switched over

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.190 align:middle line:84%
to eating for their
chakra type, so to speak?

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Excellent.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I worked with a woman
who was 120 pounds

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.830 align:middle line:90%
overweight, all right?

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And she just wanted it
to evaporate, which--

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:16.820 align:middle line:84%
all right, ironically, she
did lose the first 60 pounds

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.310 align:middle line:84%
a few years ago, but
she got really sick.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.200 align:middle line:90%
And she lost that weight.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And then she was
like, well, but I want

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.930 align:middle line:90%
to lose the rest the same way.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, I'm not in
business to make people sick.

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:29.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm like a healer personality.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:34.815 align:middle line:84%
And so what she was trying to do
was a thinker personality diet.

00:42:34.815 --> 00:42:36.440 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, what
I'm going to do is

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.020 align:middle line:90%
eat a lot of little mini meals.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.020 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know thinker.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.437 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have anything like
that in her head, all right?

00:42:41.437 --> 00:42:44.840 align:middle line:84%
She was, like, an
executive, a CEO.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.490 align:middle line:90%
I can control myself.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.170 align:middle line:90%
I can control my world.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So she instinctively
went toward a diet

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.640 align:middle line:84%
that was on the
market that was like,

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.527 align:middle line:84%
eat little bits every day,
over-prepare yourself.

00:42:55.527 --> 00:42:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.360 align:middle line:84%
By 10 o'clock every morning, she
would find herself emotional,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and she would eat literally out
of the work refrigerator what

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.780 align:middle line:84%
everybody had left
there for the day.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh boy.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: She was a second
chakra feeler, which

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:11.300 align:middle line:90%
is the toughest thing to be.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So we developed, like,
different ways for her

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:18.530 align:middle line:84%
to start keeping track of her
feelings and be OK with them.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And she-- actually, this is the
goofiest thing, but for her,

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.020 align:middle line:84%
because she had a little
bit of communicator too,

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:84%
she developed songs to sing in
her head while she was eating.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So she would eat her meals
during the day singing

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.290 align:middle line:84%
a song like, (SINGING)
if you're happy

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and you know it,
clap your hands.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:38.510 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:39.500 align:middle line:90%
It was the goofiest thing.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.513 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.

00:43:41.513 --> 00:43:43.640 align:middle line:84%
She just made happy songs,
because she was also

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.480 align:middle line:90%
a communicator.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.717 align:middle line:84%
She lost those last 60
pounds in six months.

00:43:47.717 --> 00:43:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With no real
effort in that sense.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: With no real effort.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.335 align:middle line:90%
And I let her eat carbs.

00:43:53.335 --> 00:43:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Like, she thought
I was the boss.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.902 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the boss, right?

00:43:55.902 --> 00:43:57.110 align:middle line:90%
I said, you get to eat carbs.

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.900 align:middle line:84%
She goes, nobody-- no other
diet lets me eat carbs.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.670 align:middle line:90%
It was, like, an anti-carb time.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I go, you can eat carbs.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.360 align:middle line:84%
You can eat-- you
can eat healthy fats.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.500 align:middle line:90%
You can eat this.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And we gave her
a snack every day

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that was like a
gluten carb snack.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.640 align:middle line:90%
She lost the weight.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So because you
were addressing the emotional

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:16.430 align:middle line:90%
issues--

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's it.

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --as she went--

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's it.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --rather than
using the food to cure it.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.960 align:middle line:90%
And she could have her feelings.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And then, you know
she-- oh, everybody falls off

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:26.570 align:middle line:90%
whatever bandwagon they're on.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:27.953 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any difference.

00:44:27.953 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:90%
That's just life, all right?

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's just life.

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:32.628 align:middle line:90%
OK, now, let's do one more.

00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:33.920 align:middle line:90%
We only have time for one more.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.490 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear another.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:35.907 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: This is a
very simple one.

00:44:35.907 --> 00:44:39.380 align:middle line:84%
It was a communicator, a woman
who was actually a singer,

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.127 align:middle line:84%
you know, and not
an opera singer.

00:44:41.127 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:84%
She was, like, a
rock and roll singer,

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:46.010 align:middle line:84%
so she actually wanted
to look fairly svelte.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.210 align:middle line:90%
But she was a communicator.

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.488 align:middle line:90%
She ate everything all the time.

00:44:49.488 --> 00:44:50.780 align:middle line:90%
When she was stressed, she ate.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:51.860 align:middle line:90%
When she was happy, she ate.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.277 align:middle line:84%
This and that and
the other thing.

00:44:53.277 --> 00:44:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Very silly, silly, I
mean, it was almost

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.070 align:middle line:90%
like the silliest diet.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I had her carry carrot
sticks over here

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.190 align:middle line:90%
and nut butters over here.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So everywhere she went,
she had two purses.

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Two purses.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Carrot sticks or celery,
vegetable of the day,

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:10.100 align:middle line:90%
different nut butters.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So when she was going to
eat, she just had to do that.

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'd think you'd
put them in the same purse

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:14.890 align:middle line:84%
so she could dip
them in the other.

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:16.348 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: No, no,
she couldn't do it.

00:45:16.348 --> 00:45:17.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what her thing was.

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:19.160 align:middle line:90%
She had to have the two purses.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.360 align:middle line:90%
It was just her thing.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so weird.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: She was-- she
didn't want them mixed.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It was just her thing,
childhood issues, all right?

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.690 align:middle line:90%
She stayed slim.

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.530 align:middle line:84%
She got slim, and she stayed
slim, because she always

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:31.670 align:middle line:90%
had something to eat.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:33.920 align:middle line:84%
She had been a smoker,
too, so that kind of--

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:34.460 align:middle line:90%
And the mouth thing.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.585 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: That's a big thing.

00:45:35.585 --> 00:45:36.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the mouth thing.

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:38.155 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, she
wanted to smoke,

00:45:38.155 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:84%
here comes this,
here comes that.

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And she changed
up the vegetables

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and the different
butters, and she was fine.

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.970 align:middle line:90%
You didn't count calories.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:48.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not really about
counting calories.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.220 align:middle line:90%
It's eating for yourself.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.430 align:middle line:90%
This has really been useful.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's fun.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Thank you.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Anything we didn't
get to in this?

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we
did a really good--

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:58.145 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I think we did great.

00:45:58.145 --> 00:45:59.493 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --A-B-C
job of covering it.

00:45:59.493 --> 00:45:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Anything else?

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, be easy on yourself.

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Just be easy on yourself.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm so glad we
covered the chocolate thing,

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:08.060 align:middle line:84%
because whatever your thing is--
you know, like my dad and I.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Our big thing was to eat
chocolate covered cherries.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.250 align:middle line:10%
So when I'm stressed, I don't
do it very often, every two,

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.590 align:middle line:10%
three months, I go buy
chocolate covered cherries.

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:17.640 align:middle line:10%
And then I feel like
my dad's there with me,

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:10%
so you can be emotional also.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, don't
hide from your emotions

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and from-- don't lie to yourself
about which type you are,

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:31.190 align:middle line:84%
who you are, and don't
have envy of another type.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:32.270 align:middle line:90%
That's not helping any.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's not helping.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because sometimes
people do that, right?

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They do that.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't want
to believe they're a type.

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm not like that.

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:38.540 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't possibly be that.

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.520 align:middle line:90%
I want to be like her.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It doesn't work.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
acknowledge your type,

00:46:41.978 --> 00:46:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and then start looking
at stocking your house,

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:47.870 align:middle line:84%
your kitchen with the things
that support your type,

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:49.175 align:middle line:90%
so when life gets stressful--

00:46:49.175 --> 00:46:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You're ready to go.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're ready to go.

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.835 align:middle line:84%
And if you fall off
the wagon, it's OK.

00:46:52.835 --> 00:46:54.050 align:middle line:90%
You can always climb back on.

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You can.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.580 align:middle line:90%
The wagon's just sitting there.

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.705 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's right there.

00:46:56.705 --> 00:46:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Right there.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cyndi,
thank you again.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:46:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Thank you, Regina.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
it was very useful.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll get a
lot out of this one.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Excellent.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:03.528 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I am.

00:47:03.528 --> 00:47:04.820 align:middle line:90%
My wheels are already spinning.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Me too.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.343 align:middle line:90%
I do eat this way.

00:47:07.343 --> 00:47:09.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Cyndi's also
written "The Definitive

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.630 align:middle line:10%
Book on Chakras" and its
companion, "The Little Book

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:14.880 align:middle line:10%
of Chakras" depending on how
deep you want to dive into it.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.420 align:middle line:84%
You can learn about these
and many of her other works
