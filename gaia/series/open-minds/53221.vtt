>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many
of us have learned by now

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:10%
that history is far from what
we've been taught in school.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:10%
More so, it appears
that it's some

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:10%
of our most esteemed
institutions

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:10%
that have had a hand in
obscuring our distant past

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:10%
from our awareness,
such as the Smithsonian.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Richard Dewhurst has chronicled
a surprising story of giants,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.480 align:middle line:84%
who he says ruled America
in our ancient past.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Which also puts the notion
of indigenous peoples

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:90%
into a new light.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
He's here to talk to
us about his research

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:84%
today, and also share what has
been hidden by the Smithsonian

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.360 align:middle line:90%
other institutions.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:84%
We've been trying to
do this since December,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:84%
but snowstorms and other things
have kept you away until now.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you're here.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DEWHURST: Well,
it's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:90%
We finally made it.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We finally made it.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: That's it.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.544 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first
of all, you're

00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:90%
a very tall man yourself.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:90%
About oh, 6' 6", which is tall.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.876 align:middle line:84%
That's tall for normal
human standards today.

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.375 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It qualifies me at
the very bottom of the giants.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the bottom of the
giants, top of normal humans.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So give us a little
bit of a sketch

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:90%
as to what intrigued you.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I know your own height
was of interest, but what

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.941 align:middle line:84%
intrigued you into studying
this subject so deeply?

00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, I
mean, first thing

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.315 align:middle line:84%
was when I discovered
I was going to be tall.

00:01:34.315 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:10%
I started having a fascination
with giant stories.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:10%
And as a journalist
and filmmaker,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:10%
documentary filmmaker, I had
a file of unusual stories.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And over the years I would
clip giant references,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And never really thought
that much about it, honestly.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And several years ago I was
looking for a project to do,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.545 align:middle line:84%
and I was going
through the file,

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:59.128 align:middle line:84%
and I said, I'm going to check
out this giant stuff, you know.

00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And subscribed to several online
newspaper archive services,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and began an in-depth
research on it.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.669 align:middle line:84%
And at first I couldn't
find a lot of the articles.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I used the word
search for headline,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and I think the first
one I put in was,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
"giant skeletons unearthed"
and I found 30 articles.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:10%
And that just, that was like
going down Alice's rabbit hole.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, I ended up
with over 800 stories.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Legitimate accounts.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Every state in the Union,
all the way down to Florida,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:90%
all the way out to Catalina.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:90%
And I was astonished.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Not only did I have to rethink
my belief in mythology,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
but I also had to
rethink everything

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:84%
I had been taught in school
about American history.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.645 align:middle line:84%
Because this race of giants are
the same as the Mound Builders.

00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And the Mound Builders have
been literally forgotten.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason the
Mound Builders are forgotten

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.090 align:middle line:84%
is they have no official
status with the government.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.020 align:middle line:84%
In order to have
government protection,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
you need someone to
step forward and say,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm a descendant of this tribe.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's ever stepped
forward and said,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.969 align:middle line:84%
I'm a descendant of
the Mound Builders.

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Now I joked with
some friends of mine

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
that we should get
Conan O'Brien and Bill

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Walton to step forward and say,
I have red hair, I'm a giant.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.386 align:middle line:90%
Let's protect these things.

00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:21.051 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Because that history
is long gone,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and we really will go only
so far back as what we now

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
consider to be the indigenous
peoples of this country.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Which is really
very modern history,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:84%
compared to what
we're talking about.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And as I remember
in reading the book,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:84%
there is a certain protection,
as you say, that you have.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans in
this country, for example,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:84%
have a certain protection
by the government.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, since the
'90s, they have the NAGPRA law.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's the Native American
Graves and Repatriation

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Act, which is basically
a reburial policy.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Which is why in the
last 20 years, 30 years,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:84%
we've seen nothing
about any skeletons.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Because once anything
is unearthed,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:84%
it's immediately assigned
to the local Indian tribe

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:90%
and reburied.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists
in the last 20 years

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:84%
had several run-ins
with the local Indians.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Especially the
Kennewick Man out West,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
which was dated 9,000
years old skeleton

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.517 align:middle line:84%
with genome x chromosome, which
is Caucasian, an indicator.

00:04:23.517 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Same thing happened
in Illinois, where

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
they had a huge
display for 50 years.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
It was the most popular thing
in the state of Mound Builders

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.420 align:middle line:90%
and skeletons in situ.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Local Indians said,
those are ours.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Scientists will come forward
and try and study the stuff.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
The Kennewick case was in
the courts for 10 years

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
before the scientists finally
got their skeletons back

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.150 align:middle line:90%
to examine.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, interestingly,
the Native American tribes

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
are actually obscuring
the history too now.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: They are.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Even though their
own legends say

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
that there was once a race of
giants, and when you ask them,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:90%
did you make this earth work?

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:84%
No, this was done by
the previous Mound

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Builders, and the giants.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:84%
But as you say there's
no one to speak for them.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So, what's interesting, is
because it was a more agrarian

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:84%
society at that time, most of
these juicy, wonderful articles

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.020 align:middle line:84%
come from newspaper clippings
from the 1800s and early 1900s.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
But before we get to
any of that and get

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.420 align:middle line:84%
to the artifacts themselves,
let's talk about the medium,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.090 align:middle line:90%
so to speak,

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:84%
the intellectual
medium that existed

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:84%
in which all of these
discoveries were made.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.089 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't go
there without John Wesley

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Powell coming into the picture.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.046 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
who he was, and why

00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:39.710 align:middle line:84%
he was such a prominent figure
in really even obscuring

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, John Wesley
Harding-- uh, John Wesley

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Powell, sorry.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Was one of the most
prominent Western explorers,

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and was intimately
involved in the discovery

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
of Green River and
the Grand Canyon.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And by extension, he was
assumed to know something

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:84%
about the ethnology of
the local Indian tribes.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:10%
So he was appointed in
1879 as the first Director

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.040 align:middle line:10%
of Ethnology.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Now Powell had what was
called Powell doctrine.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first paper that he

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
issued on behalf
of the Smithsonian.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, the Smithsonian's
first book, in 1848,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
was a very open-minded
study of the Mound Builder

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.030 align:middle line:90%
culture in Mississippi.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:84%
But by 1879, Powell
unequivocally

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
said we're dealing
with aboriginal savages

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
with no signs of
advanced culture,

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:90%
no signs of higher intellect.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
He said there's absolutely
no pre-Colombian contact.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:90%
We will not accept that.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And any talk of lost tribes
will not even be considered.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly
enough, Powell's father

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.650 align:middle line:84%
was a preacher, who lost his
whole congregation to Mormons.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So, no
lost tribes for him.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no
lost tribes for him.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And this dovetailed
with other Smithsonian

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:90%
policies, primarily evolution.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the 19th
century, when we

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
had our modern
scientific institutions,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
they prided themselves
on rationality.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So anything to do with religion
or myth was like a curse.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea
of evolution is

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
that we go from
knuckle draggers,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting
bigger and smarter.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't
have a chart where

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.477 align:middle line:90%
you've got 12, 10, 8, 7, 6--

00:07:31.477 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have a
descending height.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It's
called de-evolution.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: The
band DEVO actually

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.570 align:middle line:90%
was named after that concept.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:90%
And so, just you--

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he was able to
influence the Smithsonian,

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
and as a result of that,
most of the other journals

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
of the day, that would
have been considered

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.350 align:middle line:84%
the more headier academic
journals of the day,

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:90%
bought into the mindset.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was dovetailing
with Darwinism.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.309 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Correct.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a perfect storm,
and all of the universities

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.060 align:middle line:84%
took their lead from
the Smithsonian.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.817 align:middle line:84%
And the Powell Document's
never been rescinded.

00:08:11.817 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Even though there's people
internally at the Smithsonian

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:84%
now that are trying to argue
their way out of that box,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:90%
and doing some interesting work.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
It basically, after Powell,
Doolittle, and Ales Hrdlicka,

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
who was the man who came up
with the Bering Strait theory.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Now the Bering Strait theory--

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The land bridge.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD: They came, you know,
out of Russia, through Alaska,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:10%
down this little corner
of ice-- by the way, which

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:10%
has been proven to be
totally impossible.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:10%
No mention of what they ate,
surrounded by all this ice.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the book 1491,
they estimate in there

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that Hrdlicka put 30,000
skeletons into storage

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
without examination
or cataloguing.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.897 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:02.897 --> 00:09:03.522 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Mhm.

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, in his case, he
didn't want any kind

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
of European contact, because
it blew his scientific theory,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.674 align:middle line:84%
which was, again, the official
policy of the Smithsonian.

00:09:14.674 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, at this time, the
arrogance in thinking was such.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And we have been indoctrinated
into that as well, that when

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
you see these
pictographs, whether it's

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.340 align:middle line:84%
through Egyptian art works,
or American Native art

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:90%
works about ancient pasts.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Or aboriginal art works
where you have giant beings.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
We've taken that
to be metaphorical.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
stance of academia,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
is that this is
all metaphorical.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Right.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:84%
That there were
basically children

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:84%
who were trying to create
things bigger than ourselves.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
The biblical stories
about Goliath,

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:84%
or stories of Frost Giants,
stories of the Titans,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.550 align:middle line:84%
all of this was the result
of adolescent thinking.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, in line with
the idea of evolution.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.457 align:middle line:90%
We've outgrown that.

00:10:02.457 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:90%
We have outgrown that.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.214 align:middle line:84%
However, academia has
not outgrown that.

00:10:06.214 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're doing
what we're doing today.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: No, actually,
adolescents are the academics.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're holding onto
their little bottle,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and they won't let
anyone else, you know.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you say anything, you
know, it's my-- this is mine.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean there's so
much evidence against evolution

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.660 align:middle line:84%
as it was drawn up by
Darwin, I think he even

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.800 align:middle line:84%
had doubts himself,
as the story goes,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.296 align:middle line:90%
and we know his associate did.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: We know that
birds were dinosaurs.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Birds didn't
grow into dinosaurs.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Dinosaurs became birds.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
so much evidence,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
just on a genetic level
alone, so we won't even

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:90%
debate any of that.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about what happened.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Charles Dolittle Walcott.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Where did he come in, and
what was his influence

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.019 align:middle line:90%
on archaeology and such then?

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:52.935 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He just picked
up the same policies

00:10:52.935 --> 00:10:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and reinforced
them and made them

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.120 align:middle line:84%
the official policy
of the 20th century.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:90%
So it carried over again.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's carried over
to the present day.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And they all hold
ranks with each other

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:90%
and enforce the party line.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it also,
there is a giggle factor

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.490 align:middle line:90%
that is kept solidly in place.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, we were talking
off-camera about the fact,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:84%
once you have your
academic institutions,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and your religious, and your
media, religious institutions,

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
media, and such, that
are all essentially

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
conspiring to give us a
reflection of humanity that

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:90%
is very small.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Very limited.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Without texture.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They don't
want us thinking big.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't want
us thinking big, exactly.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They don't
want us being proud.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, they don't
want great anything.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when you start looking
at the evidence of what you've

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
come across-- I mean,
and I had looked

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.419 align:middle line:84%
into some of this many
years ago as well.

00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Probably about the same
time when you first

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:90%
started doing this research.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And I remember finding
it so interesting,

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
these obscure little
articles from Ohio,

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and especially in the
Midwest, from the late 1800s.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Where someone would be
digging around in their garden

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and stumble across a
massive femur of some kind.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, that has been
completely obscured.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They were dismissed
as hoaxes, animal bones,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.487 align:middle line:84%
but in the 19th
century, amazing quote

00:12:20.487 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:84%
that I used in the beginning of
the book from Abraham Lincoln.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:84%
He was making a speech
at Niagara Falls in 1848.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "The eyes of
that extinct species of giant;

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
whose bones fill the
mounds of America,

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:84%
have gazed on Niagara
as ours do now."

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So it shows you just how
widespread the knowledge

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:84%
of the giants was
in the 19th century.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Now the interesting
thing about that

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:84%
is he gave that
speech, unknowingly,

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
at the site of a giant city
that was up in that area,

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.730 align:middle line:84%
where they found
numerous 9 foot giants.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Then a little south of
there, in Cayuga township,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.960 align:middle line:84%
was what was called the cemetery
of giants, where they found

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.110 align:middle line:84%
200 giant skeletons,
7 to 9 feet tall.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:84%
A little farther down the state,
they found 150 7 to 9 footers.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Pennsylvania, more.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And all the way out
to Catalina Island.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And Catalina Island is in
the 1920s, this happened.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:84%
International news, front
page Sunday supplement

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:90%
feature articles.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:84%
3,781 skeletons dug up
by the Catalina museum.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ralph Glidden
headed the digs.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:36.806 align:middle line:84%
7 to 9 feet tall, 9' 2" king,
end of megalithic era stone age

00:13:36.806 --> 00:13:38.466 align:middle line:90%
temple.

00:13:38.466 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And within 10
years, not only was

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:84%
all of those exhibits shut down,
but all references to the stuff

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:90%
was scrubbed, totally.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I just find
it such an amazing conspiracy.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.535 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is a--

00:13:56.535 --> 00:13:57.613 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And then they
call him a crackpot.

00:13:57.613 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a crackpot.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.293 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He was the
curator of the museum,

00:14:00.293 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and he headed the
Hay Foundation, which

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:84%
was officially part
of the Smithsonian.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.660 align:middle line:84%
In the book, I show
that the Smithsonian

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
has 536 negatives
from those digs.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying
right now to get

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
the Smithsonian to come forward
and show what those images are.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:90%
It would be very interesting.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:84%
What piqued my curiosity,
about 15 years ago

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
is I had stumbled across
the story about the cache

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian artifacts that
were in the Grand Canyon.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going to
a lecture of a man who--

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.740 align:middle line:84%
he was an archaeologist, but
he also did his own digs.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Not only was he
showing the location

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.127 align:middle line:84%
of that particular cave,
in which those artifacts--

00:14:45.127 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Is that the
conflux of the Little

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Colorado and the Colorado River?

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's on the side
of a very steep drop off.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.540 align:middle line:84%
This is not an easy
place to get into.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.744 align:middle line:84%
So it makes you
wonder first, A, how

00:14:55.744 --> 00:14:56.910 align:middle line:90%
did that stuff get in there.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to start looking at
other means of transportation

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.640 align:middle line:84%
to fly that kind of
cache of a sizable amount

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:90%
of Egyptian artifacts in there.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Smithsonian,
then, the article

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.580 align:middle line:90%
made it to the Phoenix Sun.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Back in what, 1910?

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Huge, yeah.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:09.331 align:middle line:90%
Huge article.

00:15:09.331 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Huge.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Huge article.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.334 align:middle line:84%
The Smithsonian comes
in, it's all covered up.

00:15:14.334 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: We don't know
who these people are,

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.417 align:middle line:90%
it's all a hoax.

00:15:16.417 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't know who
gave this interview.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
know who they are,

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:84%
they've spirited
everything away.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, this man had
been in the cave.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:90%
He had seen it.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said it's very,
very difficult to access.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.153 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, and
the legends in the area

00:15:26.153 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
say that the entrance
to the sipapu, which

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.330 align:middle line:84%
was where the Indians went
to survive the apocalypse

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:90%
with the Ant People.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ant People.

00:15:35.925 --> 00:15:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: The Ant People.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.778 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thinks
they're talking about ants.

00:15:38.778 --> 00:15:41.385 align:middle line:84%
I think they're talking about
the survivors of Atlantis,

00:15:41.385 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
A-N-T. And in the
book, also you have

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the Sons of Anak, which
is in the book of Numbers.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Where they say we came to
this strange land inhabited

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:84%
by giants, before whom we
stood like grasshoppers.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And you just find the
myths, over and over again,

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:84%
reinforcing the same themes
with the same root words,

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:90%
with the same associations.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
By extension, in
Death Valley, they

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
found a similar underground
temple in 50 connecting caves.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.420 align:middle line:84%
8 to 9 foot giants
dressed in what

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:84%
they called
sheepskin-looking zoot suits.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to get to that.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I just find this so fascinating.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And the same man that was
talking about the cave

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.502 align:middle line:84%
in the Grand Canyon
that had stored,

00:16:28.502 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:84%
at one time, the
Egyptian artifacts

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
before the Smithsonian came in
and spirited everything away,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:84%
he had also come
across these clay

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:90%
tubes that were burial tubes.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And this man, you and I
were talking off-camera,

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I cannot remember his name.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.560 align:middle line:84%
He agreed to do an
interview with me,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and then he said he's had so
much harassment, he backed out.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Now these were
standing burials, correct?

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.113 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These were
standing burials,

00:16:52.113 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and these beings were anywhere
between 9 and 15 feet tall.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:84%
They had their clothing on,
and I saw the images of them.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:90%
They had hair, very red hair.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Bright, orangish-red hair.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.839 align:middle line:84%
And as you're going to
tell us in a little bit,

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these skeletons have
blond, waist length black hair,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:84%
red hair, that's
still intact after--

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Catalina was blond.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Red hair all over the
country, including Florida.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Black hair often.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm not saying
that all the population

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Americas was
Caucasian or giants.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
But the main central
burials in the majority

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.290 align:middle line:84%
of the major mounds across
America-- and again,

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand,
hundreds of thousands

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.610 align:middle line:90%
of mounds in the Americas.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
The Smithsonian
themselves had estimated

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:84%
over 150,000 mounds in
the east coast alone.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:84%
People don't think there's
any mounds out West.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, out West is
covered with mounds.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:84%
There was Lake
Lahontan, which was

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.735 align:middle line:84%
at 5,000 feet in California,
Nevada, and Arizona border.

00:18:02.735 --> 00:18:06.420 align:middle line:90%
It was big as the Great Lakes.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.300 align:middle line:84%
That's where Spirit Cave,
Lovelock Cave has been found.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
It's in association with
the temple complexes

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
in Death Valley and
the Grand Canyon.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.379 align:middle line:84%
And the finds all the
way through California.

00:18:20.379 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, in ancient lore, and
certainly about Atlantean

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:84%
times, it's often discussed
that the people were very large

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.500 align:middle line:90%
in stature.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And so, if there were these
confluences, historically,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:84%
of events that were occurring,
if you were having events that

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.410 align:middle line:84%
required having to
leave a given area

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and migrate to other
places, certainly it's

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:84%
not beyond reason
that we could expect

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.060 align:middle line:84%
to see these same people,
these same types of beings,

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.372 align:middle line:90%
arriving in the Americas.

00:18:51.372 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why we
think-- because we've

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.580 align:middle line:84%
been given such a
virginal history,

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.550 align:middle line:84%
except for a few
savages, it's ridiculous.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well,
we've been given

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:90%
a Judeo-Christian history.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, everything
came out of the Mideast.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But magically, these cultures,
Egyptian and Sumerian,

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
that appeared in the Mideast,
appeared at their highest form

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.945 align:middle line:84%
of culture, and
then degenerated.

00:19:09.945 --> 00:19:10.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:10.695 --> 00:19:11.425 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: But
when you ask them,

00:19:11.425 --> 00:19:14.005 align:middle line:84%
well how is this possible, they
say, well, they say, history,

00:19:14.005 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, I mean,
things like that happen.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, no they don't.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they don't.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:90%
That's devolution.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: These were
clearly civilization

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.214 align:middle line:84%
brought in at a high
level from somewhere else.

00:19:23.214 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.379 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:24.379 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, just to get a
perspective here.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
to Robert Wadlow.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think many people
have probably seen

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.610 align:middle line:84%
some of his photos,
if they've ever

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:84%
looked into the
subject of giants.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:90%
But we have a little video--

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Largest modern man.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Largest modern man.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at a
little video we have of him,

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll discuss
this a little further.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:47.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.135 align:middle line:84%
>>VIDEO: Making ends'
feet is certainly

00:19:49.135 --> 00:19:52.795 align:middle line:84%
a big job when it takes
size 39 shoes to fit them.

00:19:52.795 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Two into one do go.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.345 align:middle line:84%
Here's the owner, Robert
Wadlow of Chicago,

00:20:05.345 --> 00:20:10.102 align:middle line:84%
who in the ripe old age of
17, stands 8' 4" in his socks.

00:20:10.102 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally,
seems to be quite

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.893 align:middle line:90%
beyond the reach of young women.

00:20:12.893 --> 00:20:18.172 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.172 --> 00:20:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Every time young Robert
goes through a doorway,

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.894 align:middle line:90%
He scores a duck.

00:20:21.894 --> 00:20:25.590 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.105 align:middle line:84%
And this is Robert's father,
a mere dwarf of 6 feet.

00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:33.099 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have a few
other family photos of him,

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.480 align:middle line:90%
while we talk about him.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.021 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Now, he
was 8' 4" in that.

00:20:38.021 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
He made it to 8' 11", but
he only lived to be 22.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:84%
He suffered from a
pituitary condition.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.820 align:middle line:84%
He had a tumor on
his pituitary gland.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:10%
Now the giants that
we found in the mounds

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.710 align:middle line:10%
are clearly not suffering from
gigantism, as they call it.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:53.450 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:10%
And this man, just as a matter
of scale, as we can see here,

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:10%
he's 8' 4".

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.490 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about giants,
the rulers in particular,

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.277 align:middle line:84%
who ranged between
9 and 12 feet tall.

00:21:05.277 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Just as a matter of scale.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
bring up something.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.749 align:middle line:84%
Do you know who Klaus
Dona is by any chance?

00:21:09.749 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Oh, yes.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Very well, yes.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's a friend
of mine, and I've

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.955 align:middle line:84%
gotten to know him
through our work.

00:21:13.955 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Amazing stuff.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing stuff.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the
interviews I did with him,

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I was at his
apartment in Austria,

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:90%
I believe we were in Austria.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And he handed me the
occipital bone of a person,

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and this had gone through
university examination

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, that
they determined

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
to be between 23
and 25 feet tall.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Now again, Robert is
nine feet tall max,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:90%
in what we just saw there.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.742 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to look
at what's going on.

00:21:47.742 --> 00:21:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And I want to bring
up something we

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.741 align:middle line:84%
talked about briefly
off camera, too.

00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:51.770 align:middle line:90%
The pituitary.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So he had a pituitary tumor
that created this gigantism.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But we know, when you go
into the ancient studies,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:84%
the classic ancient
studies, the pituitary's

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:90%
responsible for our growth.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Our spiritual
evolution, all of it.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.894 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It's
essential spiritual,

00:22:06.894 --> 00:22:09.394 align:middle line:84%
but it's also considered the
most important gland in general

00:22:09.394 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:90%
by the ancients.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:90%
And so what was going on there?

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that this
devolution, the tiny stature

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.020 align:middle line:84%
we have now, is
really more a process

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.249 align:middle line:84%
of having a negatively
impacted pituitary?

00:22:22.249 --> 00:22:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: I agree.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:84%
My personal opinion is
that when you take out

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.662 align:middle line:84%
diet and nutrition, which
is why they always say,

00:22:31.662 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
oh, we're getting
bigger and stuff.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you go back into
really ancient culture with

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:84%
high spiritual practices,
with-- it's even conceivable,

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
stimulation of the
pituitary gland--

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:47.811 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Could have resulted
in some of this growth.

00:22:47.811 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
worth thinking about,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
because our assumptions
are so backward in what

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:84%
the human species
is to begin with.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: And so restricted.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so restricted.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
we were talking about,

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:84%
is the leaders in these
mounds were usually

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.100 align:middle line:90%
between 7 and 9 feet tall.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.144 align:middle line:84%
So he would've been
a normal-- Robert

00:23:05.144 --> 00:23:06.810 align:middle line:84%
would have been a
rather average looking

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.720 align:middle line:90%
sized fellow from that time.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.660 align:middle line:84%
But also there was a fineness
of features, of strength,

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:90%
of real broadness.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Their broad shoulders.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.704 align:middle line:84%
These were fully--
it wasn't gigantism,

00:23:16.704 --> 00:23:18.870 align:middle line:84%
these were fully intact,
very powerful human beings.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Fully
articulated, by all means.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
It looks like beautiful
looking people.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.560 align:middle line:84%
The picture of the
Queen, the 8' Queen,

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.472 align:middle line:90%
bedecked in her copper finery.

00:23:30.472 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a fine physical
specimen, right there.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here you have these
people between-- here she is.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Queen, who
was-- how tall was she?

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.550 align:middle line:90%
8--

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.633 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: She was 8 foot.

00:23:40.633 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Her King consort, who was
buried on top of her, was 9' 2".

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about, now all

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
these little dots you see
are very intricately stranded

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.159 align:middle line:90%
pearls.

00:23:51.159 --> 00:23:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Correct.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Freshwater pearls.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Especially in Ohio.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
The finds of the giant mound
burials in Ohio, in some cases,

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:84%
over a half million
freshwater pearls.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Often the mouths are
stuffed with pearls.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is in association
with the copper and mica

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.230 align:middle line:90%
jewelry, the crowns.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.197 align:middle line:84%
And again, people say, well,
why do you say they ruled?

00:24:14.197 --> 00:24:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they're buried in
the middle of the mound,

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're wearing
a copper crown.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a tip off.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also,
again, the copper crown.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:84%
The crown and any
other jewels that

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.410 align:middle line:84%
are associated with
crowns, have directly

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.880 align:middle line:90%
to do with the pituitary gland.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.299 align:middle line:90%
They always did, historically.

00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Interesting,
I didn't know that.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.715 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:32.715 --> 00:24:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, this woman was
buried with the King.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.974 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
position they were buried in.

00:24:38.974 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, the thing
about the Mound Builder burials

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
is they're a wide
range of burial types.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:84%
In this case, they
were buried in unison

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
with each other in what might
be called a "cosmic embrace."

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have couples
with their knees intertwined,

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:90%
sitting, facing each other.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
In two cases, holding
stela with hieroglyphs.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you get a number
of standing burials.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes surrounded
by standing stones.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
something called

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.643 align:middle line:84%
Sun Circle burials, where
it'll be a group of 8,

00:25:22.643 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
10, 12 individuals, all facing
in, and then the King, usually

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:84%
in a standing position
in the middle.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:90%
So, just incredible variety.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, when people talk
about hoaxes and stuff,

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
what I always say, and I
try to include in the book,

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:84%
was the associated burial
positions, and the associated

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:90%
grave goods.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Now you might be able to fake
a giant bone here or there.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about
detailed grave goods,

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.517 align:middle line:90%
high degrees of pottery--

00:25:56.517 --> 00:25:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of the
art that has been found

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely-- it's exquisite.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't do any
finer art work today.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, almost as though
it's been machined,

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.510 align:middle line:84%
because of the evenness
and smoothness of texture.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.140 align:middle line:90%
The fineness of the features.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.845 align:middle line:84%
And again, in association
with these giants,

00:26:15.845 --> 00:26:18.380 align:middle line:84%
just explain some of the
pieces that you've come across,

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:18.900 align:middle line:90%
this look.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:90%
This-- look at this beautiful.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.595 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yeah
that's considered

00:26:21.595 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:84%
one of the finest
pieces of pottery

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.060 align:middle line:90%
discovered in the Americas.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can just see the
almost machine quality to it.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And in association with
the Catalina finds,

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:43.420 align:middle line:84%
there was a 65 pound urn which
they found in the burial site.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And everyone commented that it
seemed to have been machined.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.100 align:middle line:90%
It was of such high quality.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't just
apply to pottery.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:84%
It goes right across
the board into accounts

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of dams, irrigation
systems, the pipes, alone,

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:90%
that come out of the mounds.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.630 align:middle line:84%
The majority of the
ones in the book

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:10.220 align:middle line:84%
are from West
Virginia, were in 1883.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I found the Smithsonian's
old field report,

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:84%
which said they
found three giants.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:90%
This is very famous.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Came out of Iowa.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.820 align:middle line:10%
A lot of controversy at
the time as to whether it

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.460 align:middle line:10%
was an elephant or a mammoth.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.389 align:middle line:84%
The people that were
trying to be conservative

00:27:27.389 --> 00:27:28.680 align:middle line:90%
were saying it was an elephant.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.096 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's no history
of elephants in the Americas

00:27:31.096 --> 00:27:33.120 align:middle line:90%
either, so.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.110 align:middle line:10%
But people that
know anatomy seem

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:10%
to think it's a
mammoth, in which case,

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:10%
this degree of
accuracy, it would have

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:10%
had to have been observed
10,000 or 20,000 years ago.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And this
degree of artistry.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.340 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD: The artistry
of the pipes and carvings

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:10%
was one of the things that
really just blew me away.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.185 align:middle line:10%
Because these things are
being found in association

00:27:58.185 --> 00:28:00.060 align:middle line:10%
with the giant burials,
and associate burials

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.210 align:middle line:10%
that aren't giants.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:09.140 align:middle line:84%
But the degree of sophistication
artistry is, across the board,

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.650 align:middle line:84%
much higher than what was
associated with later American

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Indians.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask the
American Indians,

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:20.974 align:middle line:84%
again, they say this is
from a prior culture.

00:28:20.974 --> 00:28:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
some of the other finery.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
sophisticated jewelry as well.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Copper seemed to be the
medium that was used the most.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, the
freshwater pearls,

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.380 align:middle line:90%
wherever they found them.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: And mica.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And mica.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And mica.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a lot
of beautiful jewelry

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:39.470 align:middle line:90%
that was associated.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:42.410 align:middle line:84%
But also, one thing
I found intriguing,

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:47.980 align:middle line:84%
going to the Louvre, and
also the British Museum

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.170 align:middle line:90%
on Egyptology, is the games.

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:84%
The sophisticated board
games and such that existed.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And
children's games as well.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.693 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And children's
games that existed.

00:28:55.693 --> 00:28:59.907 align:middle line:84%
So those same accoutrements were
found in these American mounds.

00:28:59.907 --> 00:29:01.490 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
other things that

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:84%
were found, by way of
fabric, for example?

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you talked
about these zoot suits.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, there's two
incredible things out West.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:10%
One is the finds in the
Death Valley caves, where

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.810 align:middle line:10%
they go into detail about
these sheepskin looking

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.950 align:middle line:10%
zoot suits that were
apparently tailored

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:10%
pants, and coats, and buttons.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, there was
a series of connected temple

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.870 align:middle line:84%
rooms that all led to
what they characterized

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:90%
as almost looking like a museum.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Where they had niches
with the bones of saber

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:42.130 align:middle line:84%
toothed tigers, giant sloths,
mammoths, and dinosaurs.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.422 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Saber toothed tigers.

00:29:43.422 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Right.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:44.940 align:middle line:90%
And dinosaurs.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, people say, well
OK, this is ridiculous.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But let me just
make this one point.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.830 align:middle line:84%
The Ica stones in South
America also showed giants.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's cave petroglyphs in
Nevada that showed dinosaurs.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know this seems crazy,
but in the last 10 years,

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.040 align:middle line:84%
scientists in Germany and
at North Carolina State both

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
begin independently cutting open
giant bones, which has never

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.200 align:middle line:84%
been done before, because they
were considered too valuable.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And they found soft tissue
within these dinosaur bones

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:84%
that's been dated to
20,000 to 36,000 BC.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And these papers-- there's
a huge scientific conference

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.040 align:middle line:84%
in Singapore where they
presented these findings.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.570 align:middle line:84%
The woman at North
Carolina State

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.490 align:middle line:84%
has been under attack for the
last 10 years over all this.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: But I'm just
putting it out there.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:84%
The other amazing
thing about fabrics

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.240 align:middle line:84%
was found in Spirit
Cave out in Nevada,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:84%
which is associated with
Lake Lahonton again.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were excavating
bat guano out of there,

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and under several
feet they started

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:84%
to discover what looked
like human remains.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.595 align:middle line:84%
And they had to contact
the University of Nevada,

00:30:58.595 --> 00:31:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and archaeologists came
out, took a look at it.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:84%
What they found was
three skeletons mummified

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and wrapped in very
fine tulle fiber fabric.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.560 align:middle line:84%
With like, Egyptian
thread count.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:90%
It was that advanced.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.310 align:middle line:84%
They-- as this was the 1940s,
they looked at the stuff,

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:84%
they said, well it appears
to be 500, 1,000 years old.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And immediately filed it away.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.227 align:middle line:90%
In the late '90s--

00:31:30.227 --> 00:31:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just a casual comment.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:90%
500,000 years old.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: No, no.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:33.620 align:middle line:90%
500

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, 500 to 1,000?

00:31:34.823 --> 00:31:35.323 align:middle line:90%
I thought--

00:31:35.323 --> 00:31:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: To 1,000 years.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So the scientists at the
University of California

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.190 align:middle line:90%
read about this in the '90s.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And he went to Nevada, and
found the things in storage,

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.890 align:middle line:90%
pulled them out of storage.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And carbon dated
them to 7,500 BC.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Mummification and
advanced weaving.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a shot of the
shroud in the book.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Now one would think the
news of a 7,500 year

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
old mummified anything,
anywhere in the world,

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:90%
would have been a sensation.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.584 align:middle line:90%
No one knows about it.

00:32:15.584 --> 00:32:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:17.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:90%
So, fabric.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So sophisticated fabric
weaving, we know, at least that

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.347 align:middle line:90%
far back, right?

00:32:25.347 --> 00:32:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: 7,500 BC.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 7,500 years at least.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.912 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And associated
with the copper finds,

00:32:30.912 --> 00:32:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I said to myself, where's
all the copper coming from?

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out, Northern
Michigan, Keeweenaw Peninsula.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And then by extension into
the lake, there's something

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.546 align:middle line:84%
called Isle Royale,
which I found

00:32:41.546 --> 00:32:44.360 align:middle line:84%
is a very interesting
name for it, number one.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.080 align:middle line:90%
The royal island.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And that island is literally
made out of copper.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And because of a
volcanic upthrust,

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:52.870 align:middle line:84%
the copper was
exposed to the air,

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.270 align:middle line:84%
all the sulfur
impurities burned off.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's over 99% pure.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.905 align:middle line:84%
Two professors in
Michigan wrote a book

00:33:00.905 --> 00:33:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and estimated that 1.5
billion pounds of copper

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.860 align:middle line:84%
were taken out of there over
a period of 10,000 years.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
besides the jewelry

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and such, what else-- what
other remnants have you found,

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.540 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what the
copper was used for?

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, they
can't account for it.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.293 align:middle line:90%
They said, well, in the mounds--

00:33:20.293 --> 00:33:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a lot of jewelry.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: We see
a lot of jewelry.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of independent
researchers up in that area

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.180 align:middle line:84%
have reported
petroglyphs of Cretan

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.550 align:middle line:84%
looking ships, Egyptian
looking vessels,

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.559 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the Vikings.

00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Now it's very interesting,
the copper trade

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:44.346 align:middle line:84%
fell off in 1500 BC, and
started backup at 900 AD.

00:33:44.346 --> 00:33:50.160 align:middle line:84%
In 1500 BC, the Santorini
volcanic explosion in Crete

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.050 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Which, among other
things, I think accounts

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.050 align:middle line:84%
to the Exodus story,
and completely destroyed

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:90%
that seagoing culture.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense that the
copper trade dropped off.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And then it started up at
900 AD, which is exactly

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.837 align:middle line:84%
the time they say the
Vikings showed up.

00:34:06.837 --> 00:34:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.210 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about pipes earlier.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.969 align:middle line:90%
Were the pipes made of copper?

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Mostly soapstone
and other substances,

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.520 align:middle line:90%
very hard other stones.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it,
were you impressed

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.344 align:middle line:84%
more with the precision
with which these were made?

00:34:22.344 --> 00:34:23.469 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Precision, yeah.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:27.510 align:middle line:90%
And how it was worked.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:90%
It's the same story.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.179 align:middle line:84%
You get this high degree
of granite and stuff

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:36.480 align:middle line:84%
like that, that seems
to have been easily

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.370 align:middle line:90%
manipulated and worked on.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:43.244 align:middle line:84%
And science says they
had crude instruments.

00:34:43.244 --> 00:34:45.570 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know this,
they didn't know that.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And they do it with the Great
Pyramid, and Great Stones,

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.949 align:middle line:84%
Baalbek, and come up with these
ridiculous stories in order

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:57.262 align:middle line:84%
to make people from the extreme
past look like children.

00:34:57.262 --> 00:34:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Like ignorant children.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, but
people like you-- yes.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:03.750 align:middle line:84%
People like you, and Klaus Dona,
and Christopher Dunn, though.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.150 align:middle line:90%
I have such respect for him.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:08.600 align:middle line:84%
He's done amazing
research in terms

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.480 align:middle line:84%
of showing that it was
virtually impossible for some

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.970 align:middle line:90%
of those megalithic statues.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Laser like precision.

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:15.371 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
laser like precision.

00:35:15.371 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, a lot of
the statuary in Egypt

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.950 align:middle line:84%
was machine tooled,
back in its day.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yeah,
there's no question.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean he's done photos
where he's taken like,

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the face of Ramses,
and shown that, you

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.644 align:middle line:84%
can put the right
cheek against the--

00:35:29.644 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect, flawless.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: It's perfect, yeah.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.250 align:middle line:84%
He says the only
way that you can

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.890 align:middle line:84%
do that is with a
computer program.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're
looking at a society.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And we've started slowly
coming to embrace,

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.750 align:middle line:84%
yes, there were in
the Middle East, maybe

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.450 align:middle line:84%
some more advanced
civilizations.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:46.410 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't
gotten to the point,

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:50.880 align:middle line:84%
because your work is really
relatively new and phenomenal,

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.372 align:middle line:84%
that the same thing was
going on all over the planet.

00:35:53.372 --> 00:35:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Right.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, I joke at one
point, especially

00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.300 align:middle line:84%
in light of the finds out West,
which we know are 7,500 BC.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, also
the Florida bog mummies.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Florida bog mummy story is
another, just mind blower.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:14.160 align:middle line:84%
They were putting in a
condominium complex near Disney

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.400 align:middle line:84%
World, in Titusville, which
is on the Atlantic coast.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And the developers
drained a lake there,

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and they discovered under
the peat moss, skeletons.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So they contacted the University
of Florida and Florida State.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:84%
They came out, started
digging in there.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.071 align:middle line:84%
And what they discovered
was several hundred

00:36:36.071 --> 00:36:41.380 align:middle line:84%
red haired, mummified skeletons,
the hair was still in a knot.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And they had been ritually
buried with stakes.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't get any
funding for it at all.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can you believe that?

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They had to
raise independent funds,

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and the developers,
on their own dime,

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.657 align:middle line:84%
put up $60,000 worth
of machines so they

00:36:58.657 --> 00:36:59.740 align:middle line:90%
could drain the stuff out.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:03.380 align:middle line:90%
This took 10, 15 years.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the University of
Florida in the last couple

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.610 align:middle line:84%
years has stepped
forward by a grant

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.299 align:middle line:84%
from a private individual,
who allowed them to do it.

00:37:11.299 --> 00:37:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Same thing happened on
the West coast of Florida.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:17.270 align:middle line:84%
They had health spas
over on the West coast.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the '50s they
were very popular,

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and people would come
down and vacation.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the guys was
an ex Navy diver,

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.399 align:middle line:84%
and he started scuba diving
and coming up with skeletons.

00:37:29.399 --> 00:37:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the tourists started
coming up with skeletons,

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and he tried to get the
government involved,

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:90%
no success at all.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.990 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the West coast,
they're actually cenotes.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:84%
They thought they were
only 40 feet deep.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.361 align:middle line:84%
And they're shaped
like an hourglass,

00:37:44.361 --> 00:37:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and they come back out, and
at the bottom is peat moss.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And underneath the peat
moss, hundreds of red haired

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:50.680 align:middle line:90%
skeletons.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.772 align:middle line:90%
Dated 7,500 BC.

00:37:51.772 --> 00:37:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
red haired skeletons

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.095 align:middle line:90%
are all over the country.

00:37:55.095 --> 00:37:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yep.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So I joked at one point,
because they always say, well,

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.704 align:middle line:84%
when did the Europeans
discover America?

00:38:00.704 --> 00:38:02.245 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well
maybe you've got it,

00:38:02.245 --> 00:38:04.360 align:middle line:84%
like, completely
backwards, you know?

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, if you go back to 7,500
BC, especially out West, that

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:14.900 align:middle line:84%
was considered the
most lush biodiversity

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:90%
existing on the planet.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps we discovered
them, and they

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.230 align:middle line:90%
didn't discover us at all.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are
so many question marks

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.063 align:middle line:84%
that come up when you start
looking into all this.

00:38:26.063 --> 00:38:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I really don't even know
where to go with it.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of--
it's just data.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.070 align:middle line:90%
At this point, it's just data.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Trying to string it all together
seems almost impossible,

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.850 align:middle line:84%
unless you just stick
to a particular locale

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and see that there
was a particular very

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.880 align:middle line:84%
advanced or sophisticated
culture of the day.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the mounds
themselves a little bit.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the ways in which

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.290 align:middle line:84%
the internal structure
of the mounds were built.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And purpose, and ceremony,
and that sort of thing.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.151 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, there are
several different types

00:38:58.151 --> 00:38:58.650 align:middle line:90%
of mounds.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:38:59.774 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here we have one.

00:38:59.774 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: That's
Monks Mound, which

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.530 align:middle line:84%
is in Cahokia, which
is in Saint Louis,

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.980 align:middle line:84%
at the confluence of
three major rivers.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And a huge significance
to the site.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:12.460 align:middle line:84%
They originally estimate
that the city of Cahokia

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.330 align:middle line:90%
was 50,000 to 60,000 people.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:84%
In the last two years,
the city of Saint Louis

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.780 align:middle line:84%
has been doing extensive work
on their sewers and roads.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.655 align:middle line:84%
And they've discovered
that they're

00:39:21.655 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
finding Cahokian remains all
over underneath Saint Louis.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:84%
They've upped the estimate
to 100,000 to 150,000 people.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:31.446 align:middle line:90%
Now we have--

00:39:31.446 --> 00:39:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When
were the Cahokian,

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.805 align:middle line:84%
what is the age
estimate on that?

00:39:34.805 --> 00:39:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well the Cahokian,
again, fell in 1200 to 1500

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:44.810 align:middle line:84%
AD as Mound Builder culture in
general, across the country.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:84%
People ask me,
well what happened?

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.530 align:middle line:90%
I personally think disease.

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I also think that
the Mongol invasion

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.770 align:middle line:84%
went not only East, but West,
and came into the Americas.

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And probably brought the
Black Plague with it.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And so at Cahokia, the site has
never been properly studied.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.520 align:middle line:84%
The man that was
officially assigned

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.330 align:middle line:84%
to do some tentative
digs was also

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:16.470 align:middle line:84%
associated in covering up some
of the extraordinary finds

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.210 align:middle line:90%
in Sayre, Pennsylvania.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Including the horned skull.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I was
going to get to that next.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.401 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Which they squashed.

00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:26.740 align:middle line:90%
It's the same guy there.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, OK.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I don't even know
what to do with all of this.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I can't
remember the guy's name,

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.955 align:middle line:84%
but the archaeologist that
was involved in this find,

00:40:34.955 --> 00:40:35.120 align:middle line:90%
squashed--

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was
in Pennsylvania.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yeah,
Sayre Pennsylvania.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.500 align:middle line:84%
It was associated with
Phillips Andover Academy.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And again--

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's a humanoid?

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.871 align:middle line:90%
Is it hard to say?

00:40:46.871 --> 00:40:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yeah, I
mean, some people

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.350 align:middle line:84%
think it's an ET, some
people think it's, you know,

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.840 align:middle line:90%
a devil race.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.290 align:middle line:84%
But there's numerous
accounts of horned giants

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.660 align:middle line:90%
and horned mythological figures.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, Michelangelo
honored this himself.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Correct.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.057 align:middle line:84%
And Alexander the
Great was also--

00:41:05.057 --> 00:41:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was said to--

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah, head of horns.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:07.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sport horns.

00:41:07.575 --> 00:41:08.338 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah.

00:41:08.338 --> 00:41:10.605 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] I know.

00:41:10.605 --> 00:41:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, but why
did Michelangelo put horns

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:14.960 align:middle line:90%
on Moses?

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, that's
the big question.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you would
think there would-- people--

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It should
be a sensation.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This would
be a sensation.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.140 align:middle line:84%
That people would be
flocked around this all day

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:29.550 align:middle line:84%
long, asking the simple question
of why does he have horns?

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.764 align:middle line:90%
This is Moses.

00:41:32.764 --> 00:41:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Occam's razor
would tell you he has horns

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:36.706 align:middle line:90%
because he had horns.

00:41:36.706 --> 00:41:38.194 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:38.194 --> 00:41:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And sometimes it's
as obvious as that-- I mean,

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.261 align:middle line:90%
it's so absurd.

00:41:45.261 --> 00:41:45.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So far, A, what is the largest
skeleton that's been exhumed?

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yeah.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.670 align:middle line:84%
The best account that
I put in the book,

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:00.740 align:middle line:84%
with multiple people,
townspeople, doctors,

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.890 align:middle line:84%
scientists, and so forth, was
on the Ohio/Indiana border.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:08.070 align:middle line:90%
They found an 18 footer there.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.995 align:middle line:84%
With a 9 foot copper
sword and an iron helmet

00:42:11.995 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that, in the article, they
say resembled something

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.600 align:middle line:90%
from Nineveh.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.620 align:middle line:90%
That was by far the biggest.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.680 align:middle line:84%
You have a range of
10 to 12 footers.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them up in
Minnesota, in association

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.600 align:middle line:90%
with the copper mines up there.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Which, again, I think
is very interesting.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Because Isle Royale
being the royal island,

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.090 align:middle line:84%
you would have
your biggest giants

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.230 align:middle line:84%
protecting your
most valuable asset.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.650 align:middle line:90%
So it would make sense.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Ohio, as we talked about
earlier, we've got 9 footers.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Next to the King and
Queen, they found

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:56.400 align:middle line:84%
a circle of mounds that had,
I believe, nine skeletons.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:90%
8 to 9 foot.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So that was in association
with the other two.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And then a lesser class,
which is by far the most

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:08.550 align:middle line:90%
common, which are 7 to 9 feet.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
ethnicity is really varied

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:12.260 align:middle line:90%
across the country.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.750 align:middle line:84%
There was one, as I recall,
one leader, 9 foot tall man,

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.690 align:middle line:84%
was found with a little
white haired child.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Kentucky.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Kentucky.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.488 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that a little bit.

00:43:22.488 --> 00:43:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And then also about the really
spectacular sounding one

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.140 align:middle line:84%
with the waist
length black hair.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.620 align:middle line:90%
He sounded just exquisite.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Yeah, he
definitely should

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.580 align:middle line:84%
have been in some
heavy metal rock band.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah. [LAUGHTER]

00:43:34.305 --> 00:43:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: The
Kentucky/Tennessee finds

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:36.700 align:middle line:90%
are amazing.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing account
I found was Dr. John Haywood.

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And he not only made first
person on site examinations,

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:49.540 align:middle line:84%
but also collected
over 100 years

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:53.100 align:middle line:84%
of what he considered the most
authentic finds in the area.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.350 align:middle line:84%
The finds in Kentucky
and Tennessee

00:43:55.350 --> 00:44:00.630 align:middle line:84%
include secret caves,
sacred springs,

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:04.750 align:middle line:84%
standing monolithic
stones, nine foot giants

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:08.370 align:middle line:84%
found with blond
haired children,

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and what they called the
Moon-Eyed children, which

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.697 align:middle line:90%
I thought was very interesting.

00:44:12.697 --> 00:44:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, the
little teensy ones.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Haywood was--
they were excavating

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.180 align:middle line:84%
mounds in Tennessee
and Kentucky.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.785 align:middle line:84%
And they kept noticing
small mounds in association.

00:44:24.785 --> 00:44:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they
thought, well let's just

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.850 align:middle line:90%
find out what's in these things.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And they dug in, and what
they essentially found

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:33.360 align:middle line:90%
were small coffins.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Three feet long.

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And inside them were bones
of pygmies, or midgets,

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.790 align:middle line:84%
or leprechauns, whatever
you want to call them.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.190 align:middle line:84%
The Indians called them
the Moon-Eyed children,

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:47.370 align:middle line:90%
or the Moon-Eyed people.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
the Moon-Eyed people

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:54.450 align:middle line:84%
were associated with giants,
always found in their company.

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:58.234 align:middle line:84%
Only came out at night, and
liked to create mischief.

00:44:58.234 --> 00:44:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:01.540 align:middle line:84%
It's almost the story, as
you say, of leprechauns.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And I thought, well
this is the exact same thing

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're saying
about leprechauns.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:09.990 align:middle line:84%
There on the cover is
one of the Moon Children.

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Right there, yeah.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So, a lot more to our heritage
and history than we've

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:17.210 align:middle line:90%
been taught.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so then
that brings us now

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.170 align:middle line:90%
to some speculation.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, there is
so much in this book.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of snagged
a little bit of this

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and that to inquire about, just
to get some visual imagery.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:33.670 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about maybe
an overarching theme.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Throughout history, as we
said in the very beginning,

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:39.120 align:middle line:84%
all of the indigenous
peoples around the world

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.840 align:middle line:90%
have talked about giants.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And most of the indigenous
people around the world

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.970 align:middle line:84%
have also talked about
their space brothers.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:50.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
UFO and giant connection.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Or not UFO, just off world
cultures, and our connection

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.195 align:middle line:90%
with other planetary systems.

00:45:55.195 --> 00:45:56.903 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well,
mythologically speaking,

00:45:56.903 --> 00:45:58.540 align:middle line:84%
the Sumerians are
probably the ones

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.970 align:middle line:84%
that we always look
to, because when

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:06.660 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the Anunnaki,
those from heaven to Earth

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.180 align:middle line:90%
came.

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, that gets back into
this A-N, A-N-T root

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:14.500 align:middle line:90%
that I was discussing earlier.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.360 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki, in many
accounts, and even in accounts

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.330 align:middle line:84%
of Gilgamesh, were
a race of giants

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:25.920 align:middle line:84%
of an advanced
technical culture.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.980 align:middle line:84%
You have the Sons of Anak in the
book of Numbers in the Bible,

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Anannaki, Anak,
Atlantis, Ant people.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.050 align:middle line:84%
This root word crops
up over and over again.

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So by implication, if we use
the forbidden word Atlantis,

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.340 align:middle line:84%
there seems to have been
an advanced culture.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.435 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily have
to have come from outer space

00:46:55.435 --> 00:46:56.000 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.791 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It could be
indigenous, you know?

00:46:57.791 --> 00:47:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well I often--
we have flying saucers.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.130 align:middle line:90%
We have airplanes.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.110 align:middle line:84%
If we land an airplane
in an aboriginal culture,

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:08.390 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't we be the ones
from heaven to Earth came?

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.440 align:middle line:84%
You bring an example
of that in the book

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.850 align:middle line:84%
forward that I thought
was very interesting.

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So you
know, I say, yes, they

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:20.290 align:middle line:84%
had Vimanas, or flying
machines, or whatever

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:21.260 align:middle line:90%
you want to call them.

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.801 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
Hindu culture, yeah.

00:47:22.801 --> 00:47:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I'll reserve whether
they came from outer space,

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.950 align:middle line:84%
or they just had
the technology to be

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:31.087 align:middle line:90%
perceived as coming from space.

00:47:31.087 --> 00:47:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So through whatever means, it
appears that advanced culture

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.080 align:middle line:84%
had been seeded here
a long time ago.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.480 align:middle line:84%
You're just arguing that
it doesn't necessarily

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.935 align:middle line:84%
mean that it was
seeded from elsewhere.

00:47:44.935 --> 00:47:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Yes.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Because we have so much
evidence, and so many

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:50.640 align:middle line:90%
conflicting stories.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's so hard to get
some of this information

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.640 align:middle line:84%
across without being accused of
believing in too many out there

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.140 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So I just say that all
my research indicates

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.830 align:middle line:84%
that there was an
advanced civilization that

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:12.780 align:middle line:84%
had technological, scientific--
I think they thought

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:16.030 align:middle line:84%
differently than we did,
and didn't try and make

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.857 align:middle line:90%
machines do things.

00:48:16.857 --> 00:48:19.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to
say, the technological piece

00:48:19.065 --> 00:48:20.580 align:middle line:90%
is what's interesting to me.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They seem to have
known how to sympathetically

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:29.960 align:middle line:84%
stimulate natural powers
and currents, and in a way

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:35.480 align:middle line:84%
that didn't interfere with the
natural ecological systems.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.130 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
mounds in America,

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:41.040 align:middle line:84%
there's not a lot of evidence
for defensive structures.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Although there's ritual
burials, in some cases,

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.470 align:middle line:90%
of giants in full armor.

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's one very big
mythological story that

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.100 align:middle line:84%
concerns the Lenni
Lenape Indians,

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:56.230 align:middle line:84%
who say they originally
came from out West .

00:48:56.230 --> 00:49:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Which would indicate 5,000
BC, when the Lassen Volcano

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:06.030 align:middle line:84%
destroyed all Lake Lahontan,
and that whole culture fell.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Their stories say they came
across the Mississippi,

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and they ran into the
Algonquin Indians,

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:16.410 align:middle line:90%
who were also a race of giants.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And a serious, epic
battle started,

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that was eventually
joined in by the Menengwe,

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and the Lenni Lenape
ended up victorious.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And eventually took
over the Atlantic Coast,

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:35.680 align:middle line:84%
from Long Island in New York
down to around Delaware.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
it doesn't seem

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to have been a
worldwide culture.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Although
it's interesting,

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:46.040 align:middle line:84%
because some of the lore
around Atlantis, for example,

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and various stages of Atlantis,
was that they certainly

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.620 align:middle line:84%
had the abilities,
and had harnessed

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.780 align:middle line:84%
these natural
forces, as you say.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's sound, light,
crystalline energies,

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.700 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Vibrations, and to be able to
use it with form and thought,

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:03.417 align:middle line:90%
create it into--

00:50:03.417 --> 00:50:04.791 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And
quantum mechanics,

00:50:04.791 --> 00:50:05.735 align:middle line:90%
it proves all of that.

00:50:05.735 --> 00:50:07.068 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It proves all of that.

00:50:07.068 --> 00:50:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And so, we know that existed.

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:11.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that,
we're now assuming--

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: We're coming
closer to accepting it.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.839 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coming
closer to accepting

00:50:13.839 --> 00:50:16.740 align:middle line:84%
that that kind of a very
sophisticated culture existed.

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.025 align:middle line:90%
But then, at the same time--

00:50:18.025 --> 00:50:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: They degenerated.

00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Because you also have
the lore that even while

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that existed, that
kind of very peaceful,

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.290 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated culture.

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Very advanced agricultural
techniques, and so forth.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.790 align:middle line:84%
There were air raids
and attacks from above.

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.341 align:middle line:90%
From craft from above.

00:50:36.341 --> 00:50:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I'm getting into,

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.460 align:middle line:84%
this notion of
maybe a confluence

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.490 align:middle line:84%
of different off planet
cultures with ours.

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And they're certainly--

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Very conceivable.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Conceivable, and yes.

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: For instance, out
here, this is Poverty Point,

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:49.731 align:middle line:90%
and this is Northern Louisiana.

00:50:49.731 --> 00:50:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's-- you can see,
it's laid out in a very non

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:57.510 align:middle line:90%
defensive way.

00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:00.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a place
called Circleville

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:03.320 align:middle line:84%
in Ohio, that very
much resembled that.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:06.140 align:middle line:90%


00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And they estimate
that there could

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:10.120 align:middle line:84%
have been 100,000 people
living here, by the way.

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And in Circleville in
Ohio, this is bizarre,

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:16.220 align:middle line:84%
but when they
occupied Circleville,

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.390 align:middle line:84%
they built the
town in association

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.380 align:middle line:90%
with the existing circles.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Then at some point in
the 1830s, the town

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.912 align:middle line:84%
decided that they wanted
to square the circles.

00:51:25.912 --> 00:51:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, sure,
why not? [LAUGHTER]

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So [LAUGHTER]
they raised funds,

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:35.650 align:middle line:84%
it was called
"squaring the circle."

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And probably had
Masonic implications,

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:40.390 align:middle line:84%
but they started
squaring the whole thing,

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:84%
then they just gave it up and
plowed the whole thing under.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:46.635 align:middle line:84%
And stories like
that are voluminous

00:51:46.635 --> 00:51:47.820 align:middle line:90%
all over the country.

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Dam building.

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Another great destroyer
of a lot of this evidence.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:57.280 align:middle line:84%
In Oklahoma, they
put a dam in there.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:02.002 align:middle line:84%
In the process, they
found a 100,000 plus city.

00:52:02.002 --> 00:52:03.710 align:middle line:84%
People said, well,
gee, it's in Oklahoma.

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.001 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've got Cato lake
there and the Cato culture.

00:52:06.001 --> 00:52:10.280 align:middle line:84%
The pottery we were looking at
earlier was from Cato culture.

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And an aquifer in
Texas, which was also

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.020 align:middle line:84%
considered the biggest
freshwater aquifer.

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they found
the city for 100,000 people.

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Now they've found evidence
of huge ancient forges

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.730 align:middle line:90%
to work with metals.

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:28.842 align:middle line:90%
That was all flooded out.

00:52:28.842 --> 00:52:32.200 align:middle line:90%


00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Out West, they put
another dam out there.

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.120 align:middle line:84%
At some point there
was an estimate

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.350 align:middle line:90%
of a six mile long city.

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:44.890 align:middle line:84%
The White Sands Missile
Testing Range, before they

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:47.080 align:middle line:90%
took that over.

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Association with the
Cliff Dweller culture.

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Another 100,000 city.

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Niagara Falls, indications
50,000 to 100,000 people.

00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So our conception of what
was here in the Americas

00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:01.630 align:middle line:84%
is-- I mean, we think
everybody lived in teepees.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:02.624 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:53:02.624 --> 00:53:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:04.262 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Not true.

00:53:04.262 --> 00:53:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, not true.

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And actually on the
Cliff Dweller subject,

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I was going to do a documentary
called The Mystery of the Cliff

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Dwellers, a number of years ago.

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to go into
who and how this happened,

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:17.416 align:middle line:84%
but I came across
some information

00:53:17.416 --> 00:53:19.040 align:middle line:84%
from someone who
would be in a position

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.482 align:middle line:84%
to have all of the
elevations and such.

00:53:21.482 --> 00:53:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, what
they were saying is

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:26.070 align:middle line:84%
they had hiked that whole
four corners region.

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And noticed that there
was a particular elevation

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.420 align:middle line:84%
at which all of
this had occurred.

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And they essentially
said, there.

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Just as kind of solving
the Cliff Dweller,

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:39.440 align:middle line:84%
as a potential answer to
the Cliff Dweller mystery.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- that had all
been in inland sea.

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything is marked at
the same level, waterwise.

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.000 align:middle line:90%
The Petrified Forest included.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.541 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, Lake
Lahontan was at 5,200 feet.

00:53:49.541 --> 00:53:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: So all the finds
out West are above 5,000 feet.

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're all
right around 5,200 feet.

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Including a lot of this--

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And that's true
across the board, over three

00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:00.400 align:middle line:84%
or four or five
states out there.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And we've been led to believe
the Cliff Dwellers are

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:07.330 align:middle line:84%
contemporaneous with
our modern Indians.

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I show in the book,
there's a 1910 report

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:12.910 align:middle line:84%
from the Smithsonian,
itself, who

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:16.410 align:middle line:84%
says they estimate the
site was at least 3,000

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:18.710 align:middle line:90%
to 5,000 years old.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:23.310 align:middle line:84%
That the stairs are so
weathered by human use

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.510 align:middle line:84%
that it would have
taken thousands of years

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:26.540 align:middle line:90%
for that kind of wear.

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:27.289 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:27.289 --> 00:54:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So whatever kind of, in this
one man's supposition on this,

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:35.170 align:middle line:84%
is that whatever body of
water was there is gone now.

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it just leaves us to
think that these people had

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:41.910 align:middle line:84%
reason to build defensively up
on the side of these mountains,

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:46.807 align:middle line:84%
when actually, most likely they
had boats right out in front.

00:54:46.807 --> 00:54:47.640 align:middle line:90%
Their little canoes.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.655 align:middle line:84%
And their supplies
came in via water.

00:54:49.655 --> 00:54:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, and another
absurdity of the Smithsonian

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:53.320 align:middle line:90%
was no boats.

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had to walk
over glaciers and stuff.

00:54:57.490 --> 00:55:01.045 align:middle line:84%
Curiously, last month,
in associated research,

00:55:01.045 --> 00:55:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I just found Smithsonian's
back on Santa Rosa Island,

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.030 align:middle line:84%
which is part of
the Channel Islands,

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:09.280 align:middle line:90%
associated with Catalina.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Glidden found 1,500 more
giants on the other islands,

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.120 align:middle line:84%
plus the Golden Gate
Museum found stuff.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.210 align:middle line:84%
UCLA supposedly has 200 of these
skeletons at the Fowler Museum.

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they're on
Santa Rosa Island,

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.250 align:middle line:84%
they've gone back out to do
digs on a plateau out there.

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Now they haven't said
they found any skeletons,

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:29.360 align:middle line:84%
but what they have said
is that they have now

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.880 align:middle line:84%
established human habitation
at at least 10,000 BC.

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And unquestionably,
the use of boats.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:38.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, this is
a non-linear topic.

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:45.150 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of a
non-linear conversation.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:47.434 align:middle line:84%
Because we're just trying
to turn over stones and say,

00:55:47.434 --> 00:55:48.850 align:middle line:84%
well this is what
they found here,

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:50.280 align:middle line:90%
this is what they found there.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly is
leading to, if we

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:58.650 align:middle line:84%
can't put a linear context to
the development of civilization

00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:02.440 align:middle line:84%
in the Americas because
it was so diverse,

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.900 align:middle line:84%
we maybe can put
a larger context

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:10.590 align:middle line:84%
to why it seemed so necessary to
hide that information from us.

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:12.190 align:middle line:90%
And we can finish on that note.

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:15.642 align:middle line:84%
Because this is really
something that is-- in my mind,

00:56:15.642 --> 00:56:16.225 align:middle line:90%
it's criminal.

00:56:16.225 --> 00:56:18.730 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well, they talk
about stories of Atlantis,

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:25.250 align:middle line:84%
or the great stories
of the Titans,

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:31.320 align:middle line:84%
or Poseidon, or biblical high
culture, Sumerian high culture,

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.400 align:middle line:90%
dismissively.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Especially beginning
in the 19th century.

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Prior to the 19th
century, these ideas

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:41.370 align:middle line:84%
were embraced by
the intelligentsia.

00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Plato was held in high
regard by Thomas Jefferson,

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.960 align:middle line:90%
among other people.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.960 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
the Atlantis stories

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:51.570 align:middle line:90%
was not some conspiracy theory.

00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:55.240 align:middle line:84%
The idea that high
culture, that human history

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:59.220 align:middle line:84%
has highs and lows,
peaks and valleys.

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, we got
it into our heads,

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:05.000 align:middle line:84%
as we started inventing little
machines and stuff like that.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's ever done this before.

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:09.430 align:middle line:84%
We're smarter than
everybody else.

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, you
know, anything that

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:15.870 align:middle line:84%
indicates any high degree
of technical sophistication

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:18.460 align:middle line:84%
associated with
ancient history has

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:23.210 align:middle line:84%
been put in the bin of whack
jobs and conspiracy theorists.

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to
come out of that now.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's the
underlying theme that's

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:33.290 align:middle line:84%
kept this information from being
really scientifically examined

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and accepted as part
of our tradition,

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:37.260 align:middle line:90%
and not part of myth.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:38.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Now if someone has a little
summertime vacation ahead,

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.400 align:middle line:90%
where would you suggest one go?

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:48.410 align:middle line:84%
If they want to go on a giant
tour of America, what would be

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:50.150 align:middle line:84%
say two to three of
the top spots to go,

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:53.410 align:middle line:84%
where you can see some actual
skeletal remains, mounds,

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:54.470 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: I don't know very--

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, because this
is spread all over the place.

00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:59.659 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Impossible today
because of the NAGPRA laws.

00:57:59.659 --> 00:58:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Just-- one of the
last places that you could go

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:08.830 align:middle line:84%
was Nevada at the Humboldt,
the sites out there.

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:12.060 align:middle line:84%
The Winnemucca museums
had four giant skeletons

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.490 align:middle line:90%
that were on display.

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Then the state of
Nevada said, we

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:18.510 align:middle line:84%
don't officially recognize
these, and withdrew them.

00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Then for a while, they were
showing them in the back room.

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:24.280 align:middle line:84%
We're presently,
right now, trying

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.670 align:middle line:84%
to get the Fowler Museum
of the Smithsonian

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:28.790 align:middle line:84%
to open up some
of this evidence.

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:32.380 align:middle line:84%
At the very least, show
the 536 photographs

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.435 align:middle line:90%
from Catalina Island.

00:58:33.435 --> 00:58:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Now curiously, the museum
there was reincorporated

00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:39.430 align:middle line:90%
as the Catalina Island Museum.

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Two years ago they
were doing research

00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.210 align:middle line:84%
in the storage rooms for
an exhibit on World War II,

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:48.480 align:middle line:84%
they discovered Ralph Glidden's
boxes and research material.

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.890 align:middle line:84%
This was covered in
the Los Angeles Times.

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:53.320 align:middle line:84%
They go through the
boxes, they say,

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.890 align:middle line:84%
this man was not a
crackpot, apparently.

00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:58.820 align:middle line:84%
All these stories seem
to have been true.

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.710 align:middle line:84%
He was an excellent
archaeologist,

00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:05.090 align:middle line:84%
worked very vigorously,
found all this stuff.

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:09.090 align:middle line:84%
No mention of the
3,781 skeletons

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:11.100 align:middle line:90%
that averaged 7 feet tall.

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Nobody from UCLA stepped forward
and said we have 200 of these.

00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Nobody from the Smithsonian
said we have photos of all this.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:19.660 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's time
to put a little pressure

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:21.900 align:middle line:90%
on the Smithsonian.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: You got it.

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe
that's the next step.

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: That's the next
step if you want to see.

00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you
want to do something,

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:27.960 align:middle line:90%
if you want to see any of it.

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I hear Klaus is
on to some interesting things

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:30.860 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be
catching up with him too.

00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Keep me posted.

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I certainly will.

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And thank you so much.

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:37.799 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was
just-- it just kind

00:59:37.799 --> 00:59:39.840 align:middle line:84%
of leaves your hair curled,
to think that here we

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:45.400 align:middle line:84%
have from 7 feet to
18 feet tall, 18 foot

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.820 align:middle line:84%
tall human beings, red hair,
black hair, white hair.

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Finery.

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: I'll tell you
another thing people can do.

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.030 align:middle line:84%
In their neighborhoods,
because mounds

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:54.110 align:middle line:90%
are all over the country.

00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Keep your eyes opened.

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.870 align:middle line:84%
If it looks like an
artificial mound,

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:59.450 align:middle line:84%
it probably is an
artificial mound.

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.700 align:middle line:10%
See if you can investigate it.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.690 align:middle line:10%
See if there's a local
history regarding it.

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:07.260 align:middle line:10%
Get actively involved;
look in your backyard.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Look in your backyard, put some
pressure on the Smithsonian.

01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:14.455 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've
done an amazing job

01:00:14.455 --> 01:00:16.772 align:middle line:84%
of archiving all of
this information.

01:00:16.772 --> 01:00:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Those articles and
the photographs.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for your work.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.094 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD: Very kind, thank you.

01:00:21.094 --> 01:00:22.593 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again,
the book is titled,

01:00:22.593 --> 01:00:24.230 align:middle line:84%
The Ancient Giants
Who Ruled America,

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:26.188 align:middle line:84%
which can be found online
at major booksellers.

01:00:26.188 --> 01:00:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And on this topic, you also
heard me talk about Klaus Dona.

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
You might want to check
into my interviews with him

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
on the CMN archives
here on Gaiam TV.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.682 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
