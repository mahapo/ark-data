00:00:20.615 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Our
angel lady, Belinda Womack,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.910 align:middle line:10%
is back with us.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:10%
Today we're talking about
the nature of wealth--

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:10%
inner wealth.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Because of millennia
of conditioning,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.080 align:middle line:84%
human beings have been
left with the sense

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're either not
enough or not worthy.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:84%
The angels are going to
share their vision of how

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.108 align:middle line:84%
to transform our
sense of self-worth.

00:00:38.108 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't just a
woo-woo conversation.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into the nitty gritty.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Both of us are feeling all
of the beings and energies

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.528 align:middle line:84%
in the room with us right now
and I'm a little overwhelmed.

00:00:47.528 --> 00:00:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was starting get a
little anxious because there's

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:90%
so much in the space around us.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And you were letting me
know that that includes

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
some of the money masters of
our ancient past, the ones who

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
have helped create the
system that we've now

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.942 align:middle line:90%
become enslaved to.

00:01:02.942 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> BELINDA WOMACK: Yes.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:90%
It is true.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:90%
They are here.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.362 align:middle line:84%
So we need to get
straight on a few things,

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
because that system is not
working out too well anymore.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Most people are suffering
as a result of it.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the biggest
anxiety on this planet is

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:84%
this feeling that
we can't generate

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:84%
enough to protect ourselves
and survive and take care

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves and one another.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably the
number one fear on this planet.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Well,
Regina, they agree.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:10%
And they say that it's time.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:10%
It's just time for humanity to
understand the solution is not

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:10%
complex, but the
solution has definitely

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:10%
been hidden, very well hidden.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And their intention
for our conversation

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
is to reveal the
doorways to open

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:90%
to reach the truth to freedom.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.535 align:middle line:90%
It's time to be free.

00:01:55.535 --> 00:01:56.868 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's time to be free.

00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times, in
order to get your freedom--

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:90%
to buy your freedom back--

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.635 align:middle line:90%
takes courage.

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Sure.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.325 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And this is the
big leap for people is to have

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:10%
the courage to truly
live into the new way.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
But we chose this time
to incarnate into.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:90%
We chose to help transform it.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So before we even begin
and bring all the beings

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:90%
into the conversation--

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:90%
although they're already here--

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
your understanding,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.927 align:middle line:84%
because this has been
something that they have

00:02:21.927 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:90%
downloaded to you recently.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:84%
You're teaching a
course on it, as well,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:90%
now as a result of that.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.205 align:middle line:90%
What do they describe as--

00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:84%
seems like a no brainer
question-- but what do they

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:90%
describe as inner wealth?

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So inner
wealth is the soul.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But the soul's ability to create
and to passionately create.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.920 align:middle line:84%
The soul has access
to everything

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
that the divine
intelligence knows,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as how to make a living
doing what brings the heart joy

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and actually facilitates
evolution for all concerned.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.030 align:middle line:84%
That is the inner wealth
that can not be taken away.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:10%
And once the human brain--

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:10%
especially that
creative hemisphere--

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.705 align:middle line:10%
plugs into that
and those ideas--

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:10%
you are a very
creative thinker--

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:10%
once those ideas
start to generate,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:10%
that energy, that vibration
can take over and then push

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:10%
that ego through whatever the
fear spots and the resistance

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.020 align:middle line:10%
might be about.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:10%
So that is the inner wealth--

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:10%
the soul's intelligence.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And sadly that has
been hidden from our own view

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:90%
for a very, very long time now.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Yes.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:10%
So the human being has an
amazing brain and the--

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:10%
not to be cliche, but the left
logical, rational, controlling,

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:10%
where the ego lives
part of the brain

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.460 align:middle line:10%
thinks that it has to
live in a masculine world

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:10%
in a masculine way.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:10%
And that means that we have to
do things that are predictable,

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:10%
that are approved of by
society, that are proven ways

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:10%
to earn a living.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:10%
Now what the team of
the angels and guides

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:10%
call the old male
paradigm, this just

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:10%
means the old way
of doing things.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:10%
But that imprisons us into fear.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:10%
Fear feeds that
part of the brain.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:10%
It pulls the vibration down.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:10%
And it basically makes us fall
asleep to our own potential

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:10%
and to what we independently
as expressions of the creator

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:10%
have to offer that no one
else has to offer that we can

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:10%
actually earn a living from.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:10%
So as we get conditioned
lifetime after lifetime

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.930 align:middle line:10%
and we go into that logical,
rational prove it to me

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:10%
kind of brain,
that's the part of us

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:10%
that when that vibration
goes down, we feel insecure.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.580 align:middle line:10%
We forget that there is a whole
universe that has our back.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:10%
We forget that divine oneness
wants us to be successful

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:10%
and to live in abundance.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:10%
So fear feeds the logical,
rational part of the brain

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:10%
and it makes it sleepy.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.970 align:middle line:10%
And it makes it forget.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And discouraged.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:10%
And it will pull us
into despair so quickly

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.270 align:middle line:10%
and have us
believing, you better

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:10%
keep working for the
old male, or you better

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:10%
keep working for the old
male in the old male way,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:10%
or you're going to
starve to death.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.320 align:middle line:10%
But it is all fear-based.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:10%
And it's all a bunch of lies.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean,
and this is such--

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'll talk to the
group about this, as well.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:90%
I have so many questions.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But we're such an
incredibly creative species.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I've really started looking
at this in a whole new way

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:90%
very recently.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:84%
One thing that my
own beings that I'm

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
very close with as
well once had said--

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to make a
joke, but they're not actually

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:90%
humorous by nature.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Pretty perfunctory--
but it was a funny.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned
this I think over

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:90%
the years a couple of times.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And they said, what you
call the left brain,

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.375 align:middle line:90%
the conscious mind--

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
what you call the
conscious mind,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
which of course, is the least
conscious part of ourselves--

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
they said was actually
only there initially

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:84%
in the animal aspect
of the human being

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.960 align:middle line:84%
to more or less keep you
from bumping into things.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle line:90%
I started laughing.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yes, we
were trying to be funny.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:84%
But the point
being, the part that

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:84%
keeps you at least
in tune enough

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:84%
with your physical reality
that you can survive

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:90%
the day in the deep past.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:84%
But that part, the animal part
of the brain, had taken over,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and had blocked off the
other aspect of ourselves,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.740 align:middle line:84%
that defined multidimensional,
higher dimensional true self

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
had blocked off that
whole aspect of being

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:90%
to our awareness.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, it just took
over, like a muscle

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:90%
that grew too strong.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Well, it did
grow to be very strong.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And domineering.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: And the 12 archangels
say that if you remember that

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:10%
this is a school room
and we come here--

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:10%
souls come here to learn
the awesome value of love

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:10%
or of that creative mind.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we're always
presented with fear and love.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:10%
So with the animal part of
the brain, as you call it,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:10%
it was important in order to
create this school room so

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:10%
that we would have
that bipolar brain,

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:10%
so we would have that
difference in vibration,

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:10%
because fear really pulls us low
and love really raises us up.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:10%
So they say that
animals are far more

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.460 align:middle line:10%
conscious than human beings.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:10%
So they're not arguing
with your guides.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:10%
They're just saying
that that also is a--

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:10%
there's a bit of
a shadow of a lie

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:34.200 align:middle line:10%
even over that, that we need
the conscious mind in order

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.098 align:middle line:10%
to be safe or the ego mind--

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:36.898 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:08:36.898 --> 00:08:37.698 align:middle line:90%
Our survival.

00:08:37.698 --> 00:08:38.918 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: It's not true.

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And that's all good.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.841 align:middle line:84%
And it has its beauty
in its own way.

00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:43.049 align:middle line:90%
It has its functional aspect.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But to take
over the whole shebang,

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:10%
make all of our decisions
about who we are,

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:10%
what our place in
the universe is,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.490 align:middle line:10%
what we're capable of from
that part of the mind?

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:10%
That's just wrong.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:10%
It's just wrong.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:10%
It is so limiting.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But that is what our educational
system is set up to do

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:90%
is exactly that.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:90%
All of our institutions.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: So that
we're in control,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:10%
whether we're controlling our
own self or we're allowing

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:10%
society to control us or
another person to control us.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So you say
this often yourself,

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:10%
the hermetic axiom is
as above, so below.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.472 align:middle line:90%
So within, so without.

00:09:22.472 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:90%
What does that actually mean?

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Because you often bring this
up, and the angels often

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:90%
bring this up.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So we human beings
are the creator of our reality.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:10%
We have the power
of the creator.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:10%
So as above means the
vibration of purest love.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:10%
Heaven does manifest
here on Earth.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:10%
As above, so below.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:10%
It's all about vibration--

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:10%
or as you often
call it, frequency.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:10%
So within means that where
there is fear within us--

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.850 align:middle line:10%
especially fear loves to
soak into the subconscious

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:10%
and create these wonderful,
fear-based belief paradigms--

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:10%
unless we transform
those, those fears--

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:10%
especially around the paradigms
of money and wealth and worth--

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:10%
then manifest so without
as limitation and as lack.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So if we believe we
lack within, we're

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
going to experience lack
without in our daily lives.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:10%
So what the 12 archangels
and their friends

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:10%
of the ascended masters
and all the other teachers

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:10%
that stay at that vibration of
as below, they're like, let's

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.710 align:middle line:10%
do something about this.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:90%
You cannot have lack within you.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:90%
You are from the central sun.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.590 align:middle line:90%
You are from the creator.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:10%
Lack is an illusion.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:10%
Once you human beings start to
just wake up and accept that,

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:10%
you're going to see your
outer reality change.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:10%
And as that outer
reality changes, that

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:10%
speaks to that ego
part of your mind

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:10%
that wants proof, that
wants that logical, hey,

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:10%
show me first.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:84%
You start to get
that validation.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:10%
As I tap in to that
worth and that wealth,

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.540 align:middle line:10%
that is my true identity.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:10%
Opportunities come to me.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:10%
Cash comes to me.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:10%
And I feel safer.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:90%
So within, so without.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:10%
As above, so below.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And yet,
at the same time,

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:54.390 align:middle line:10%
we have to start embracing these
parts that have been wounded

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:10%
and been misinformed and
disinformed for a very long

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:10%
period of time, and not be naive
and not be impatient with this

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:10%
process.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It took a very long time for
us to essentially descend

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.810 align:middle line:90%
into this fear-based system.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Yes.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.200 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: A very long time.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.575 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It doesn't mean
you can just do a vision board

00:12:10.575 --> 00:12:12.825 align:middle line:10%
and you're home free, which
a lot of people think--

00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:10%
I think that was part
of the New Age movement

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.220 align:middle line:10%
that didn't work too well,
because a lot of people--

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:10%
you still have your wounds.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:10%
You're still living in this
male paradigm that essentially

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.890 align:middle line:10%
expresses lack, right?

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.770 align:middle line:10%
And yet, you're
saying, doggone it.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:90%
I am good enough.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.195 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
my vision board

00:12:31.195 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:90%
and it's all going to come true.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.147 align:middle line:84%
Well, mostly it
does not come true.

00:12:34.147 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And then people think, well,
I'm really not good enough.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even make that work.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there
was a lot of despair

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:84%
around the notion of creating
prosperity in the New Age

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:84%
movement, because
it didn't work out.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- I think
what I'm adding

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
to this is the wisdom to
understand how long it's taken

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.980 align:middle line:84%
to get here, that it will
take something in ourselves

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to transform to get
back where we belong,

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and to be really patient with
the process and super creative.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: It's about a
vibration of tapping into that

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:10%
creative, divine, feminine.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: It does
speed things up.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.863 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: But you do-- you're
absolutely right, Regina.

00:13:16.863 --> 00:13:19.570 align:middle line:10%
You've got to learn
to love transformation

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:10%
because these layers of
fear are ancestral in us.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:10%
And then there's the
human collective.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.530 align:middle line:10%
So we have the human
collective ancestry

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:10%
that those of us who are
willing and have the courage

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:10%
can actually transform
very rapidly.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:10%
What the angels
and the masters--

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.180 align:middle line:10%
which just means teachers--

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:10%
what their mission is is--
at least in the course

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:10%
that I channeled-- is
they know where to go.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:10%
They guide us into finding those
key layers that then unlock

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:10%
entire caverns of deception.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle line:10%
So it does definitely
speed it up.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.660 align:middle line:10%
But the old male is everywhere.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:10%
And we are empathic
and telepathic beings.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:10%
We like to think we're
completely autonomous,

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:10%
but we're not.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:10%
So it is about making that
choice that I let my soul be

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.960 align:middle line:10%
in charge of guiding
my ego forward,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:10%
because the other part of
this about the vision board

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:10%
is what so many humans don't
get is that even when they first

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:10%
did that vision board,
it was from a wound that

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:10%
was telling them--

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.440 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: --not from their true
heart's desire and potential.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've done workshops
and lectures on that subject

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
for that exact reason, because
there is a way where those

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
things do come to pass, but it
can't be coming from the ego,

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:84%
the fear, the desire, of an
egoic nature and the wound.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:84%
You just can't choose
images that are literally

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:90%
coming from there.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's mostly
what people do.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:10%
And so I find it fascinating--

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:10%
a fascinating kind of
single snapshot glimpse

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:10%
into how our desires work,
how our expectations work,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:10%
how our wounds--

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.400 align:middle line:10%
they all come together
on these vision boards.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like that
simple little topic so much.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So do you think we
should go ahead and start

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.940 align:middle line:84%
talking to the guides,
the angels, the bankers,

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:90%
and everybody else right now?

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Yeah,
they would love that.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, good.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.515 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they have a lot to say.

00:15:42.515 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:10%
OK, whenever you're ready.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: We're ready.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.787 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for all
joining us here today.

00:15:48.787 --> 00:15:51.078 align:middle line:10%
I know you've already been
here and you're always here,

00:15:51.078 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:10%
but I want to thank
you for coming

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:10%
into this dialogue with us,
because we're addressing

00:15:55.730 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:10%
a very, very painful spot
and in time in humanity where

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.280 align:middle line:10%
people are exhausted.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.910 align:middle line:84%
They've lost a lot of
creativity and hope and energy

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and are just kind of putting
one foot in front of the other.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's start first
with finding out

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:90%
how do we descend into this?

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:10%
Was this an experiment
or was this simply

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:10%
perpetrated by perhaps
some sects of beings

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:10%
that it benefited while it
didn't benefit the rest?

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: We say that those two
questions have the same answer.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
You see, yes, it
is an experiment.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:10%
It is a schoolroom
where souls, beings, get

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:10%
to come to learn the value
of love, where there beings

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:10%
that volunteered
to, shall we say,

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:10%
create the dark force to
participate in generating

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:10%
this separation between male and
female, earth and heaven, love

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.940 align:middle line:10%
and fear.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:10%
But what is really
important that we

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:10%
want to get this
message out to those

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:10%
who have ears that can hear--

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:10%
fear or the darkness or evil--

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:10%
guilt, shame, anger,
hostility, resentment--

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:10%
always wants to
turn back to love.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:10%
It wants to flip
the light switch

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.630 align:middle line:10%
and go from dark to light.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:10%
Any entity, thought form, being
that has served darkness, that

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:10%
has gotten its jollies out of
feeling like it is in control

00:17:54.770 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:10%
and it can dominate
and hold down others,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:10%
instilled within that energy,
because all energy comes

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:10%
from the creator, is
the directional path

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:10%
back to the light.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that even the wisest

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.660 align:middle line:84%
of some of your human
scholars have forgotten.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:84%
You see, the darkness always
wants to return to the light.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.540 align:middle line:90%
It is physics of the earth.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Where there is heat, it wants to
go to the coldness in the room,

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and it wants to
create neutrality.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Darkness, fear, always wants
to go to light and to love.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:10%
So whether you
want to give credit

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:10%
to some certain
personalities, entities,

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:10%
beings, that they want
to keep fear going

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.280 align:middle line:10%
or you want to
look at it from one

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:10%
step above that perspective,
is that there is a divine plan

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:10%
There is a higher
purpose and mission

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:10%
called teaching
the value of love

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:10%
so that we appreciate what
we're really made out of

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:10%
and where we're
always returning.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:10%
Then take your pick.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:10%
We say to you, as you
have heard us repeat over

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:10%
and over again, love
is the greatest power.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:10%
And it does endure
all things, especially

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:10%
the illusion of fear,
especially the illusion

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:10%
that money is your
god and that money

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:10%
is the greater power over you.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:84%
It's time for that lie to
be revealed and returned

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:84%
to the central sun
for a transformation.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:10%
We do believe that humanity
is ready to agree with us

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:10%
on this very important point.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think this is true.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't mind giving
us a little history lesson,

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:10%
because we always like
to have perspective

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:10%
and context for what's
happened when we find ourselves

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:10%
in a predicament, which we
are in a mass predicament.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can perhaps
allow some of the entities that

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
have been involved
with creating what

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:84%
became monetary systems
on this planet what

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:84%
the original idea was,
and was this initially set

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:84%
in motion to create this
exact situation we're in now?

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Or was it something
that we can't see?

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:09.090 align:middle line:10%
We say in all
transparency that lack

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:10%
is a form or an
expression of fear that

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:10%
was introduced all the way
back at the end of La Maria,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:10%
but was definitely brought
forward during ancient and then

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:10%
forward in Atlantian times and
is very prevalent in this time.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What created that
sense of lack from the very

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.950 align:middle line:90%
onset?

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: What creates lack
is when the human personality

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:10%
or ego has the ability to
believe that it is separate

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:10%
from source, separate
from the creator.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:10%
So what comes first,
the chicken or the egg?

00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:01.300 align:middle line:10%
Lack within or earth
changes without.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.520 align:middle line:90%
We say that it is fear.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:10%
And when fear comes in and
the personality or the ego

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.070 align:middle line:10%
begins to sense,
wait a minute, I'm

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:22.540 align:middle line:10%
not connected to the creator, to
divine source, to the universe.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:10%
So how does Mother Earth hear
me that I need resources?

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:10%


00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:10%
I need to protect myself.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:10%
So the reptilian part of
the brain, the survival part

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.450 align:middle line:10%
of the brain,
which is all a part

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.060 align:middle line:10%
of this story and
this experiment

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.300 align:middle line:10%
says, I have to
provide for myself.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:10%
I have to gather.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I have to exploit.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.520 align:middle line:90%
I have to take.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:10%
And so then this creates a
lack out in the environment.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:10%
And the resources
start to go down.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.730 align:middle line:10%
The belief in lack
goes up, and so there

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:10%
is more taking, more taking from
the land that is now becoming--

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:10%
well, it's revealing
what's going on within.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:10%
That is what archangel
Gaia Mother Earth does.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:84%
She is a perfect
mirror to reveal

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:32.795 align:middle line:84%
what the emotions and the
feelings and the thoughts

00:23:32.795 --> 00:23:38.420 align:middle line:84%
are that are being generated
by the human being.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.200 align:middle line:10%
So then we move
forward very quickly

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:10%
because we do not want to
spend much time on this topic.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:10%
But we say during Roman times
the coin was introduced to say,

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:10%
instead of giving
me your chicken

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:10%
and I give you a dozen eggs or
you give me shoes for my horses

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:10.190 align:middle line:10%
and I give you some
sweet wine to drink, coin

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:14.130 align:middle line:10%
was invented to say, I owe you.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:10%
I owe you.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:10%
And those that had the coins
figured out this works.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:10%
So that was the very beginning
of money and of the lie.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Money really
represents, I owe you.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And it has become
a schoolroom of I

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
owe you, when divine
source says please,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:84%
let me bless you
with what you need.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Let me just bring it
into your reality,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:90%
bring it into your movie.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:10%
You see, as long as human beings
believe that the I owe you,

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:10%
that the currency has more
value than what you're

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:10%
going to use the currency
to go and obtain,

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:10%
you are held in the trap.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:10%
So we say, take
archangel Michael,

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:10%
sapphire blue sword of
truth, and plunge it

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:38.810 align:middle line:10%
right into the lie that
says currency is my creator,

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.000 align:middle line:10%
is my source.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:10%
Just do this and watch miracles
begin to come into your reality

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:10%
that likely you have
even given up on.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:10%
Truth sets you free.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.210 align:middle line:10%
There is no lack.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:09.300 align:middle line:10%
It was all a part of the
education, but the education--

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:10%
you've graduated
from fifth grade

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:16.220 align:middle line:10%
over and over and over
and over and over again.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:10%
Let's graduate human beings
into a far better story.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:23.705 align:middle line:10%
Let's do it together.

00:26:23.705 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:10%
And now I want to bring
another layer of that in that

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:10%
seems to have really created
a mass sense of feelings

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.620 align:middle line:10%
of being lower than, less
than, and that is religion.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:84%
When religion came-- in
many different forms,

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.680 align:middle line:84%
but let's just right now
begin with the Old Testament,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.870 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
on this planet are--

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.120 align:middle line:84%
at least in the Western
world-- are familiar with it--

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.070 align:middle line:84%
where we had punishing Gods,
angry Gods, jealous Gods.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.380 align:middle line:84%
This is taught to
children in Sunday school.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Even in our Disney movies,
if you know Disney movies,

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:84%
our children's
movies in this world

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.430 align:middle line:84%
were always shown
the great threat

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:18.530 align:middle line:84%
that either the mother or father
is killed early in the story

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're left
abandoned and alone.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk about how the
introduction of beings

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:84%
that called themselves Gods
got such a stranglehold

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.285 align:middle line:90%
over the human psyche?

00:27:30.285 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: It all begins
with the story of Eve,

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.580 align:middle line:10%
of the truth of the
divine feminine,

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:51.010 align:middle line:10%
and that the divine feminine is
actually never separated from

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:10%
the divine masculine.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:59.380 align:middle line:10%
However, if you make her the
rotten apple in the story

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:10%
so that the ego mind
or Adam has the power,

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:10%
then the soul must
go underground.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:10%
And this is Abel.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:10%
So Cain, the power of
fear, kills his brother.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:10%
And the power, the
wisdom of soul,

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.900 align:middle line:10%
goes into the subconscious.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:10%
This story-- the very
beginning of Genesis--

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:10%
was tampered with,
pure and simple,

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle line:10%
by those who figured out if
I misuse the power of love

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:53.820 align:middle line:10%
through calling it fear and
instilling fear and encouraging

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.720 align:middle line:10%
the development, again,
of the part of the mind

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:10%
that will give its power over
to me, false prophet, that

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:10%
will bring out the
message of fear

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:11.820 align:middle line:10%
and give the big lie
that the creator--

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.170 align:middle line:10%
mother, father, God--
is a punishing God.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:10%
If you do not obey the
rules, then I have power.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:28.960 align:middle line:10%
And I don't have to
look at my own lack.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.150 align:middle line:10%
I can deny my own
feminine, my own feelings

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.610 align:middle line:10%
of unworthiness and separation.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.030 align:middle line:10%
And I can trick
myself into believing

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:10%
that I am even more
powerful than God

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:10%
and call myself the creator.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:10%
So we go to the beginning.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:58.590 align:middle line:10%
Religions are masculine,
for the most part.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:10%
When you allow the
human mind to plug back

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:10%
into its own intuitive
channel the direct connection

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:10%
between the creator,
source, the soul, the higher

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:26.430 align:middle line:10%
self, and one's own
thinking and processing,

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:10%
then there is no room
for limiting religion.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.850 align:middle line:10%
You see, what religion
gives people--

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.800 align:middle line:10%
and it did this from
a long time ago--

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:45.040 align:middle line:10%
is it says, if you will believe
in fear, I will keep you safe.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So let us be
absolutely transparent.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:54.940 align:middle line:10%
If you believe in fear,
fear will keep you safe.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.230 align:middle line:10%
The ultimate fear
of any human being--

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:00.030 align:middle line:10%
it's in the root chakra--

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.310 align:middle line:10%
is the fear of abandonment.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:08.880 align:middle line:10%
So if you can believe that
the divine feminine and divine

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.720 align:middle line:10%
masculine have abandoned
you, and there you

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.850 align:middle line:10%
create an experience where
your mother and your father,

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:10%
or your beloved, or your
best friend abandons you,

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:10%
then you might want to buy
into fear that promises you

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:41.660 align:middle line:10%
if you give your power to me
and you practice these rules,

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:10%
then I will keep you safe.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:50.340 align:middle line:10%
And this is all false teaching.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.520 align:middle line:90%


00:31:53.520 --> 00:32:02.310 align:middle line:10%
Once the human being wakes
up even a little bit,

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:10%
they remember that
this is not true.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:12.690 align:middle line:10%
But you see, it is
important to take that Eve,

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:10%
that divine feminine,
and hold the intention

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.130 align:middle line:10%
on your conscious level.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.420 align:middle line:10%
I want the truth at
the highest vibration

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:28.960 align:middle line:10%
because truth is an
expression of divine love.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:37.720 align:middle line:10%
And I want to be able to
connect to truth on my own

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:45.680 align:middle line:10%
so that I know, so that I
feel it within my bone marrow.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.900 align:middle line:10%
Human beings-- this
is a simple intention.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:56.870 align:middle line:10%
You hold that intention
and so it shall be.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:10%
Each and every one of you
always have a direct channel,

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:10.900 align:middle line:10%
a direct open door, a direct
open mind to the center

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.110 align:middle line:10%
of the heart, of the creator.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So ask to stand
in that open door.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Ask to live in that open mind.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.820 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:30.870 align:middle line:10%
That is feminine, not masculine.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:36.120 align:middle line:10%
But she holds the masculine
in both of her hands

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:42.920 align:middle line:10%
and she says, Adam, use
your common sense, man.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Use your common sense.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
no room for fear.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.580 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:90%
There is no room.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Indeed, and once the
feminine influence was expunged

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.710 align:middle line:84%
for all these years,
these millennia,

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:06.420 align:middle line:84%
where the nurturing aspect
and the really fulsome,

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
creative aspect of the feminine
input was diminished down

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:16.800 align:middle line:84%
into what we have today,
what we're seeing now is that

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.969 align:middle line:84%
the men became as enslaved
if not worse than the women.

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:23.280 align:middle line:84%
At least the women could
still feel that pulse running

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.130 align:middle line:84%
through them, even through the
active creativity and birth

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:84%
where the men were really
left bereft with very little

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:33.520 align:middle line:84%
at their disposal in
this last few millennia.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And so now let's move into today
and move into the solutions

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.449 align:middle line:90%
that we see ahead of us.

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:43.860 align:middle line:10%
The women are starting to
take back their own power

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.350 align:middle line:10%
on a personal and
collective level,

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:51.570 align:middle line:10%
and are now really starting
to almost not just compete

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.630 align:middle line:10%
with men but almost
in an unhealthy way

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:56.679 align:middle line:10%
dismiss men, shove
them to the side,

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:59.070 align:middle line:10%
creating almost a lost
generation of new men

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.000 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Where the feminine
rises up, they're

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:84%
the ones going to
college, coming out.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're getting
into the corporate world

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and otherwise in
much greater numbers

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:90%
right now than are the males.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about this
change over a period

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:84%
where the woman, the
feminine, has started actually

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:24.030 align:middle line:84%
using the old masculine paradigm
to create their own realities

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:90%
and their own--

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.745 align:middle line:90%
what do you want to call it?

00:35:26.745 --> 00:35:27.545 align:middle line:90%
Gain.

00:35:27.545 --> 00:35:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: We agree.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:40.960 align:middle line:10%
We say that look
at the word woman.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.400 align:middle line:10%
The word man is there.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:10%
So whether it be
woman or a man--

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:10%
and if you notice
now at this time,

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:57.720 align:middle line:10%
there are far more human
beings incarnating that claim

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.580 align:middle line:10%
neither sex of male or female.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.410 align:middle line:10%
This, too, has a higher purpose.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:11.600 align:middle line:10%
You see, both male and
female have divine feminine

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.700 align:middle line:10%
and have divine masculine.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:10%
They have a male
part of their brain

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:19.250 align:middle line:10%
and a feminine part
of their brain.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:26.570 align:middle line:10%
So we say to women
kind, is it a bit easier

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:29.630 align:middle line:10%
for you to tap
into your feelings?

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because of
your biochemistry.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.360 align:middle line:10%
You have two X chromosomes.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.430 align:middle line:84%
The human male is actually a
mutation of the human female.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:45.520 align:middle line:10%
He is missing an arm
of the X chromosome.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:52.230 align:middle line:10%
So he is dependent on
the women in the world

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:56.250 align:middle line:10%
to help hold the strength of--

00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:10%
it is a blessing to feel your
feelings, mister human male.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.940 align:middle line:10%
Feel your feelings, for
that keeps the river

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.180 align:middle line:10%
of the feminine flowing.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:15.870 align:middle line:10%
So what we say is that
even the women that

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:22.370 align:middle line:10%
are stepping in and using
the old male paradigm

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:27.770 align:middle line:10%
to control others,
to oppress others,

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:32.900 align:middle line:10%
they, too, will turn into
dust, for ultimately that

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.230 align:middle line:10%
is what the ego that
is not supported

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:40.820 align:middle line:10%
by heart and soul, that
is what happens to the ego

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.640 align:middle line:10%
is it turns to dust.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:10%
And so the castle that
was built is taken away,

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:56.570 align:middle line:10%
whether you are the male King
Nebuchadnezzar or the female,

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:57.770 align:middle line:10%
you must learn.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.630 align:middle line:10%
You are in schoolroom Earth.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:05.110 align:middle line:10%
But this is what we say.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:13.570 align:middle line:10%
Go deeper and hear that it is
through holding the intention--

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:18.770 align:middle line:10%
male or female, man, woman.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:25.040 align:middle line:10%
Ask for your soul to reveal
to you the creative genius

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:31.560 align:middle line:10%
project that will move you
and your life, your movie,

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:37.200 align:middle line:10%
your story, forward
and be successful,

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:10%
but in a way that moves
humanity forward with you.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.470 align:middle line:10%
You see, we have said this.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:52.120 align:middle line:10%
Don't take on the
old male directly.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.610 align:middle line:10%
For then you become
just like him.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.320 align:middle line:10%
He loves to fight.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.420 align:middle line:10%
He loves to go into that
old masculine way of eye

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.920 align:middle line:10%
for an eye, tooth for a
tooth, sword for a sword.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Be like water and flow.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:16.540 align:middle line:10%
And you may say to us,
but financial wizards.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.760 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how to do that.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.950 align:middle line:10%
And we say, your ego may not.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:24.280 align:middle line:10%
But your soul knows.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:29.130 align:middle line:10%
Your soul knows how to tap
into the bank of the universe

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:36.300 align:middle line:10%
so that as you are creative,
and if you start with crayons

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.710 align:middle line:10%
and a piece of paper,
you are still beginning

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:44.630 align:middle line:10%
to open that creative flow.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.730 align:middle line:10%
It is a power.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:51.380 align:middle line:10%
It opens you to the flow
of the divine feminine that

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.230 align:middle line:10%
connects you to your soul.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:56.720 align:middle line:10%
As within, so without.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.440 align:middle line:10%
Things start to change because
your inner worth starts

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.420 align:middle line:10%
to change.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:09.240 align:middle line:10%
The divine child within you
is the voice of your soul.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:15.220 align:middle line:10%
He or she knows how to connect
your conscious mind, your ego,

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:10%
to what your soul is here
to create, to produce.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:10%
So in our teaching,
in our course,

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:27.710 align:middle line:10%
we teach you how to
connect with this child

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:35.820 align:middle line:10%
so that we can reveal the old
beliefs that belong to you

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.580 align:middle line:10%
and that are also
belong to the collective

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.620 align:middle line:10%
that you need to put in
the violet fire dumpster.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.870 align:middle line:10%
Violet fires is just the
energy of transformation

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:47.220 align:middle line:10%
and forgiveness.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:51.120 align:middle line:10%
But these old beliefs
block you from connecting

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.500 align:middle line:10%
to your feminine.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.530 align:middle line:10%
They block you from
connecting to the bigger

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.800 align:middle line:10%
river of your
creative power, which

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:04.750 align:middle line:10%
will show you step
by step how you move

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.230 align:middle line:10%
on the inside from
unworthiness-- which

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:13.930 align:middle line:10%
religion loves to saturate you
with unworthiness so that you

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:18.610 align:middle line:10%
are pliable in the
hands of master fear.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So as you transform
that unworthiness ,

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:28.533 align:middle line:84%
the fountain of
creativity starts to flow.

00:41:28.533 --> 00:41:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can we talk about
that for just a moment?

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Would you please
tell us what we look

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.140 align:middle line:84%
like from your
perspective in terms

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
of the incredible spectrum
of human creativity?

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:47.100 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: From our
perspective, you are dreamers.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.190 align:middle line:10%
You are manifesters.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:55.110 align:middle line:10%
You can design anything
that your heart and soul

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.670 align:middle line:10%
wants to design.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.150 align:middle line:10%
And you may say to
us, but you know,

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:05.380 align:middle line:10%
I've had my list of things
that I want to create.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.300 align:middle line:10%
Why hasn't that happened?

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:11.950 align:middle line:10%
And we say, because there are
actual laws that protect you

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:16.480 align:middle line:10%
from creating such
self-destruction

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.360 align:middle line:10%
that you would harm
yourself or another,

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:25.030 align:middle line:10%
especially when you have chosen
to work from a place of love,

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:30.970 align:middle line:10%
that is, when you really call
in protection so that what you

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:36.670 align:middle line:10%
begin to create comes from
a place of heart and soul,

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.600 align:middle line:10%
from that vibration.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:44.290 align:middle line:10%
So it takes time, but
it is long lasting.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:47.665 align:middle line:10%
You look beautiful
to us human beings.

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:50.510 align:middle line:10%


00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:10%
But we do-- how do we put this?

00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:01.450 align:middle line:10%
We want the help to
dissolve the metal in you

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:09.320 align:middle line:10%
so that there is more water
and energy and conductivity

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:15.160 align:middle line:10%
between the two, so that
your dream is enhanced

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:10%
with all the colors of
the rainbow and beyond,

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:28.920 align:middle line:10%
so that the genius of
Atlantis lives again

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:34.980 align:middle line:10%
and the heart and the
compassion of Lemuria

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:40.320 align:middle line:10%
is revealed transparently
within all of you.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.970 align:middle line:90%


00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the kind
of metallic visions,

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.620 align:middle line:84%
you might say, that
humanity has created

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:56.700 align:middle line:84%
in this industrialized age is
there is a song from, I think,

00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
the 1960s having to do
with describing life

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:05.370 align:middle line:84%
in a little place south of San
Francisco called Daly City.

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:06.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's a house--

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:08.610 align:middle line:84%
it's a song that
has to do with all

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:84%
the rows of the little houses
that all look the same, where

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.820 align:middle line:84%
the people all pull out of
their garage in the morning.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:84%
They drive into the city, do
their jobs in the offices,

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and come back to
the same houses.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're called little
houses made of ticky tacky.

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And so in some way,
we're still plugged

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:84%
into that where we feel we
have to grow up, go to college,

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.520 align:middle line:84%
get enough money, buy
our own individual home,

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.800 align:middle line:84%
raise our families in
that individual home,

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.590 align:middle line:84%
do what you have to do, retire,
play a little golf, die.

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's kind of
the human condition,

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:45.240 align:middle line:84%
where it could be so much
more collaborative, communal,

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.860 align:middle line:84%
tribal, beautiful if
we can join together

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.760 align:middle line:84%
in thoughts and creativity
and contribution and resource.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just see a
beautiful potential ahead.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us what
that can look like for us

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.005 align:middle line:84%
if we want to cut free
of the ticky tacky?

00:45:01.005 --> 00:45:03.510 align:middle line:90%


00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:09.570 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: We say that it helps
to bring ego home to heart

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.130 align:middle line:10%
and soul.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.720 align:middle line:10%
So instead of trying
to figure it out--

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.330 align:middle line:10%
why am I here?

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:18.750 align:middle line:10%
What is my purpose?

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:22.260 align:middle line:10%
How do I earn a living?

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:30.320 align:middle line:10%
How do I take care of my house
and my lawn and my suburb

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.580 align:middle line:10%
and my ticky tacky house--

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.090 align:middle line:10%


00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:10%
take that ego and
surrender it to your soul

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.350 align:middle line:10%
just with intention,
just with words.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:44.110 align:middle line:90%
Soul, I let you be in charge.

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, your soul relies on
your ego, your personality,

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.190 align:middle line:84%
your masculine to
carry forth that which

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:57.890 align:middle line:90%
your soul needs you to do.

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:01.250 align:middle line:84%
If you are a
songwriter, your soul

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:06.130 align:middle line:84%
needs your ego,
your personality,

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:09.790 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to
create a composition

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:13.620 align:middle line:90%
and to perform that composition.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:21.450 align:middle line:10%
But we say that if you will let
the essence of the divine guide

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:27.920 align:middle line:10%
you from within, wow, does your
happiness go up exponentially,

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:32.400 align:middle line:10%
because it raises
your entire vibration.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:39.110 align:middle line:10%
It's much easier to live in
gratitude and compassion,

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:10%
for this eradicates
poverty and lack.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:48.580 align:middle line:10%
And this creates community.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:54.800 align:middle line:10%
Each soul is a cell in
the body of the divine.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.740 align:middle line:10%
Can you imagine a
body of humanity

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:05.370 align:middle line:10%
that can run like
a gazelle, that

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:10.030 align:middle line:10%
is free to fly like the eagle?

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:16.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the human potential,
because human beings

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:20.000 align:middle line:90%
are divine.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.450 align:middle line:10%
It's all about vibration.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:33.350 align:middle line:10%
The incredible alchemy of ages
past still lives within you.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:37.590 align:middle line:10%
It is just hidden
because you may

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:44.640 align:middle line:10%
be tempted to misuse
it until all of you

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:52.700 align:middle line:10%
are ready to value that you
are made of the energy of love.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:58.570 align:middle line:10%
You can recreate
schoolroom earth abolishing

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:07.510 align:middle line:10%
all pollution and all
violence far faster

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:11.200 align:middle line:10%
than you may believe.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:16.070 align:middle line:10%
So put archangel Michael's
sword in that belief

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:23.800 align:middle line:10%
and allow your higher self to
fill your DNA and your atoms

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:29.770 align:middle line:10%
with the truth
that you can create

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:36.210 align:middle line:10%
through the power
of love, together

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:40.740 align:middle line:10%
creating a brand new earth.

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:46.473 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, you can, and you
will, from our perspective.

00:48:46.473 --> 00:48:48.390 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And you've
said this several times,

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:51.300 align:middle line:10%
now that the most core--

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.152 align:middle line:10%


00:48:54.152 --> 00:48:55.610 align:middle line:10%
if you want to call
it a practice--

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:59.960 align:middle line:10%
has to be to choose to
speak with our own soul,

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:06.150 align:middle line:10%
with the divine, and ask to
be shown our truth, our soul's

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:07.940 align:middle line:10%
desire.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't have to be done
in any ritualized way, per se.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.200 align:middle line:90%
It has to be a very direct--

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:22.670 align:middle line:84%
a direct request from our
conscious mind to our higher

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.040 align:middle line:84%
part to please allow
ourselves to be

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.890 align:middle line:90%
shown our truth and our way.

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Does that encapsulate the
beginning stages of this?

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.580 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:39.780 align:middle line:90%
You were saying male mind.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.130 align:middle line:90%
I allow the feminine to lead.

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Because
water on your earth--

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:48.160 align:middle line:90%
this is a true fact--

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.030 align:middle line:84%
dissolves, eventually,
everything.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Water will move through
every resistance

00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:00.020 align:middle line:84%
that the old male
paradigm may put up.

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:05.870 align:middle line:10%
So on a conscious level, to take
your masculine mind and say,

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:11.060 align:middle line:10%
I allow my feminine to
guide me, because then I

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.560 align:middle line:10%
move into the flow.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.770 align:middle line:10%
I allow.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:21.580 align:middle line:10%
This changes
everything, for we say

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:28.200 align:middle line:10%
this begins to create an
incredible organic computer

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:34.430 align:middle line:10%
that becomes immune from
being pulled down by fear,

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:41.460 align:middle line:10%
because the whole brain
says, hello, fear.

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.640 align:middle line:10%
I choose love.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.110 align:middle line:10%
I choose gratitude.

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:49.890 align:middle line:10%
I chose not to feed you
anymore, because I now

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:52.140 align:middle line:10%
know the truth, fear.

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:55.490 align:middle line:90%
You really want to be like me.

00:50:55.490 --> 00:51:00.020 align:middle line:84%
You really want to be divine
and return to the light.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And I've decided to help
you on your mission.

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.530 align:middle line:10%
Go home, fear.

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:11.570 align:middle line:10%
Time to go home.

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:14.660 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And in doing so, as
we begin filling our own cups

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:21.620 align:middle line:10%
with our own dreams, our own
creative vision for our future,

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:25.820 align:middle line:10%
and allow that to tap back
into that loving essence

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.900 align:middle line:10%
of ourselves, it seems to me the
next logical outgrowth of that

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:34.250 align:middle line:10%
is we let go of competition
because lack starts slipping

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.060 align:middle line:10%
away.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.310 align:middle line:90%
And we go into collaboration.

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And we want to see
each other joyful

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.690 align:middle line:90%
and expressing these dreams.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:48.500 align:middle line:10%
The hindrances of mind, the
master Buddha who was here,

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:55.210 align:middle line:10%
teaches all of you is that the
ego, through the masculine way

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:58.420 align:middle line:10%
of separating from
source, separating

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:05.950 align:middle line:10%
from divine oneness, plugs into
not good enough, competition,

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:12.820 align:middle line:10%
judging, controlling,
sleepiness, jealousy,

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:15.720 align:middle line:10%
unworthiness.

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:21.730 align:middle line:10%
All of these hindrances
are dissolved

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:30.110 align:middle line:10%
by the loving flow of intuitive
truth of the dream that says,

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:35.260 align:middle line:10%
the truth is, we can never
leave divine oneness.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:43.350 align:middle line:10%
So as Regina expresses her
soul here on Earth in a most

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:50.680 align:middle line:10%
magnificent way, and Belinda
does this and all of you

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:56.380 align:middle line:10%
do this in your
own way, your ego

00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:01.820 align:middle line:10%
is an independent
expression of the divine.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.770 align:middle line:10%
But you flow together.

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:10.380 align:middle line:10%
You flow together as
all atoms flow together

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:16.780 align:middle line:10%
in an energy stream instead of
fighting against one another.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:21.370 align:middle line:10%
And the dream becomes only
more beautiful for all

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:23.650 align:middle line:10%
to experience.

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:30.350 align:middle line:84%
As above, so below,
for all concerned.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:33.930 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And it just makes
sense that this creates so much

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:41.340 align:middle line:10%
more rich, complex,
flavorful, beautiful reality,

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:42.520 align:middle line:10%
filled with--

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.310 align:middle line:10%
just really filled
with the goodness

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:47.100 align:middle line:10%
that Earth has to offer and
our souls have to offer.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I resonate so deeply with
what you have to say.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And now I would like to
bring one further thing in--

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and I thank you for
all those reflections.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Belinda told me this
privately as a result

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.890 align:middle line:90%
of what she's been shown.

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Because with our friends
watching this show right now,

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:07.380 align:middle line:84%
we've all been exposed
to the notion of other.

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.260 align:middle line:84%
We've all been exposed to
the notion of reptilians

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and other beings that
might be trying to control.

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But what she was saying
and has been shown

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.960 align:middle line:84%
is that these beings are getting
tired of the gig themselves,

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that the frequencies aren't
a match for that anymore

00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:24.570 align:middle line:84%
on Mother Earth,
and that they would

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:28.590 align:middle line:84%
like to be able to let
go of the old agendas

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.800 align:middle line:84%
themselves and start
transforming back to the light.

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.290 align:middle line:84%
So can you just speak about
that for a few minutes

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:37.030 align:middle line:90%
before we have to say goodbye?

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:40.240 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: We are very happy to
speak about this, but we say,

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:10%
Regina, still on
schoolroom earth,

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:49.307 align:middle line:10%
human beings love fear
because it's so entertaining.

00:54:49.307 --> 00:54:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's addictive.

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: It's addictive
and it's entertaining.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:57.400 align:middle line:10%
So we understand with
that put out there

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:02.710 align:middle line:10%
that there may be a bit of an
uprising from those who just

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:08.440 align:middle line:10%
are so entertained by
grazing reptilians and devils

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:13.210 align:middle line:10%
and bad guys and monsters
and dark thought forms.

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:16.120 align:middle line:10%
But we're going to tell you the
truth at the highest vibration.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.400 align:middle line:10%
And we say that every human
being, when you're ready, you

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.720 align:middle line:10%
will feel this.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:27.610 align:middle line:10%
All of these dark
entities, forces,

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:32.830 align:middle line:10%
creations, they are
being called home

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:39.100 align:middle line:10%
to the center of the creator,
the center of the universe,

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:47.270 align:middle line:10%
that truly is all-loving and
all-powerful because oneness

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:50.490 align:middle line:10%
is all loving.

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:56.850 align:middle line:10%
These creations are bored.

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And it's boring.

00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:00.840 align:middle line:84%
The drama has just
become boring.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.260 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: Yes.

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.870 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:09.060 align:middle line:10%
So from our vision here of
heaven where fear does not

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:13.680 align:middle line:10%
exist, there are
doorways opening

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:20.270 align:middle line:10%
in the astral by the
millions and billions

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:25.210 align:middle line:10%
daily as these creations
and thought forms pack

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:31.030 align:middle line:10%
their bags, their fearful
thoughts, their guns

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:36.910 align:middle line:10%
and weapons, and
they are coming home.

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:39.880 align:middle line:10%
They are returning home.

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:43.180 align:middle line:10%
And of course, when
fear touches love,

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:46.870 align:middle line:10%
it is immediately transformed--

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.640 align:middle line:10%
immediately.

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:55.340 align:middle line:10%
So we encourage each of you
that when you feel down and out

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:59.660 align:middle line:10%
and you're asking the question,
have I been shebunkied?

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:06.300 align:middle line:10%
Have I walked through a
negative, oobie goobie world?

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:14.190 align:middle line:10%
Say, OK, wherever you are, fear
critters and bless them love,

00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:21.980 align:middle line:10%
I send you home to be returned
and transformed into love.

00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:27.530 align:middle line:10%
And then I invite
that incredible power

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:34.970 align:middle line:10%
to flow back to all the human
beings who were seduced by you,

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:41.880 align:middle line:10%
seduced by fear, so that
they wake up and they dance.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:47.780 align:middle line:10%
We allow with divine oneness.

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:48.580 align:middle line:10%
We allow.

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.450 align:middle line:90%


00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With that, thank
you so much, all of you here.

00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:58.590 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining us and
helping to give us what I find

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:00.990 align:middle line:10%
to be a very hope-filled--

00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:05.520 align:middle line:10%
and not false hope, but true
hope-filled and inspiring

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:09.630 align:middle line:10%
message of our own innate
creativity and power

00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:11.790 align:middle line:10%
to transform our reality.

00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:14.480 align:middle line:90%
And welcome back, Belinda.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Holy smokes.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
almost overwhelming.

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:19.520 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
energy in this room.

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Holy smokes is right.

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:21.680 align:middle line:90%
And they're right.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, give me a grove
of Redwood trees, some friends,

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and an apple pie to
share and I'm in heaven.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.197 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: I'm there with you.

00:58:30.197 --> 00:58:32.030 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: There's so
much that's beautiful.

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, my dear, we literally
have run out of time.

00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:36.050 align:middle line:90%
We've talked so long.

00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there maybe one final
comment or reflection

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:44.300 align:middle line:84%
you have from this conversation
that you would like to share?

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:47.750 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: I would like to
share that I myself have been

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:51.830 align:middle line:10%
practicing the teaching of the
angels and the masters through

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:54.020 align:middle line:10%
the courses I channel.

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:57.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's just
mind-blowing miraculous.

00:58:57.890 --> 00:59:03.050 align:middle line:10%
And so I've-- it's been
incredible to be witness

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:07.400 align:middle line:10%
to my own human being, being
witness to this and breaking

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.493 align:middle line:10%
free of those deep,
deep, deep layers--

00:59:10.493 --> 00:59:12.410 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: You're going
through this yourself.

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:13.520 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: --saying
I can't be free.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.060 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're going through
this on a personal level,

00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and you've recently made a move
that's brightened your spirit.

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:20.960 align:middle line:10%
And you're just-- you're
listening and following

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.670 align:middle line:10%
where exactly what
they're talking

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:24.410 align:middle line:10%
about yourself, because
you had to bring

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:26.720 align:middle line:10%
yourselves out of some stuff.

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is really
beautiful, indeed.

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, Belinda, thank you again.

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:33.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure we'll be back
together here one day.

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to thank
you for taking the time

00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and bringing all of your
good friends with you.

00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.965 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: Thank you so
much for helping all of us.

00:59:41.965 --> 00:59:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I hope you've
had a lot of fun with this

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:46.680 align:middle line:84%
conversation and also
found it really useful.

00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a big one for all of us.

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:51.200 align:middle line:84%
