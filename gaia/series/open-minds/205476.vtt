>> REGINA MEREDITH: One in four
Americans between the age of 18

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.962 align:middle line:84%
to 25 have seriously
contemplated suicide.

>> BRADLEY NELSON: We're
not designed to be isolated.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:90%
We're designed to be together.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:84%
93% of people have this heart
wall phenomenon where the heart

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:90%
can feel like it's in danger.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:84%
When that wall is
taken down, we've

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:84%
seen suicidally depressed
people get well in days.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:10%
What we have to get
back to really is--

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Dr. Bradley Nelson,
creator of the Emotion Code

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:10%
and the Body Code is with
us once again to have a much

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:10%
needed discussion.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:10%
The world has been
through so much

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:10%
of late between the pandemic
and world events, all of which

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:10%
are leaving a highway of
depression in its wake.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how we can begin
to eliminate or overwrite

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:84%
those programs lodged
in our subconscious.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And gosh, it all comes
down to that subconscious.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
That pesky thing that's kind
of like a little bag of garbage

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:84%
on our back, but
also of potential.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I think most
people don't really

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:84%
understand just how
much our lives are

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:90%
run by the subconscious.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.982 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into that in a little bit.

00:01:17.982 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, I
wanted to talk to you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:84%
about some really
kind of troubling news

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:90%
that has surfaced recently.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of it has
to do with young people whose

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.090 align:middle line:90%
world has become deconstructed.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
class, a lot of them

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.610 align:middle line:84%
they're not interacting
with each other.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:90%
And this was what came up.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:84%
One in four Americans
between the age of 18 to 25

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:84%
in a recent study have
seriously contemplated suicide.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Those are not normal numbers.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But here we are, and you
have a massive clientele.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Emotion code is globally.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I
wanted to find out

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
from you, what kind
of urgency or shift

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.985 align:middle line:84%
of your practitioners-- what
about 5,000 of them now?

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: We've got 7,000.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.515 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 7,000.

00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm behind.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:90%
That was last time we talked.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
You've been getting feedback
as the center of all of it.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.400 align:middle line:84%
What has happened since the
world's events have changed

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and the pandemic began?

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.470 align:middle line:10%
>> NELSON: Well, I
think that, of course,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:10%
what's happening with people
is that they're being forced

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:10%
into more isolation than
they've ever experienced before.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're not designed
to be isolated.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:90%
We're designed to be together.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:90%
We're not designed to be apart.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And so what that's
doing is it's creating

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of emotional baggage
for a lot of people.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when you
experience intense emotions,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.970 align:middle line:84%
those emotions sometimes
if they're too powerful

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:84%
or if you have a tendency
to bury those emotions

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and not want to feel
them, then those energies

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:90%
can become trapped in the body.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: And of course,
those are trapped emotions--

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're
going to get into that.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Yeah.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that
there are more people now

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.970 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be forming
what we call a heart wall.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.853 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Interesting,
explain that.

00:03:10.853 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
it in another show

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:84%
but now that is
becoming so prominent,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
let's give it center
stage for a bit.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Well, what happens--

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.997 align:middle line:84%
of course, the heart itself
is the seed of the soul

00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and the source of love and
creativity and romance.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything the ancient
peoples believed it to be.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And in modern science,
they're starting

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to show now that the heart
really truly is a brain.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly nervous tissue.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Most of the messages between
the brain and the heart

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.078 align:middle line:84%
are going from the
heart to the brain.

00:03:37.078 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Instead of they thought
it would be the opposite.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: And so what happens
to us is that when we feel like

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
our heart is going to break
or when things are really

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.717 align:middle line:84%
difficult or we're in a very
insecure sort of situation

00:03:49.717 --> 00:03:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and things are going on like
what we've been seeing over

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
the last year or so, then it's
a situation where the heart can

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.830 align:middle line:90%
feel like it's in danger.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And especially, this
happens if you feel

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.155 align:middle line:90%
like your heart is breaking.

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're going
through a breakup

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
or if you are really deeply
grieved or deeply hurt,

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:84%
you can feel those physical
sensations like your heart

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:90%
is actually going to break.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:84%
When that's going on,
the heart will put up

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.308 align:middle line:90%
a wall around itself.

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I believe the heart is actually
the seed of the subconscious,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.650 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And it will put up a wall
around itself made of layers

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:90%
of your emotional baggage.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's a protection
to protect the deepest

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:90%
core of who you are.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with that, though,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:84%
is that even though it might
be great in the short term,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and when the bombs
are falling, it's

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
kind of like moving your
heart into a bunker.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is when
things start to normalize,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
now your heart is still
living in this bunker

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and you've got this
wall around your heart.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And you see, when people
feel love or affection

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
for each other,
there's an energy

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:84%
that travels from their heart
to that other person's heart.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is when
you have a heart wall,

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:84%
that energy, the passage of
that energy is interfered with.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it makes it much harder
for you to give and receive

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
love, harder to really create
the perfect creation that I

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:84%
think is in the heart, and
that subconscious mind.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And so in that
wall is taken down,

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.720 align:middle line:84%
we've seen suicidally depressed
people get well in days

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:84%
from having that
wall taken down.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.465 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's the most
important thing that people

00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:29.980 align:middle line:90%
can do for themselves.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that what we have to
get back to, really, is love

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:90%
and unconditional love.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And unconditional
love basically says

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
that when you're feeling
it, you don't really

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.310 align:middle line:84%
care whether somebody
is broke or homeless

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
or whether they have a different
political view than you

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:84%
or whether they have a
different gender than you,

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.300 align:middle line:84%
it's all about loving
people unconditionally.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
is what it ultimately

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
is going to save the
world and what we need

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:90%
to move towards, all of us.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.680 align:middle line:84%
The fascinating thing
about taking down

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
the wall around the heart
is that oftentimes people

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:84%
fall in love even at
advanced stages that

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:90%
never thought they would.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:84%
People find that they
can feel the love

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
of the creator, the higher power
for them when they could never

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:90%
feel it before.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, I've got--

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I have a story I can share
with you really quickly.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, do.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: This is a man named
Giacomo Ravelli in London.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, after my heart
wall was released,

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:90%
my life completely changed.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I became far more
open to the divine

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.620 align:middle line:90%
and I started lucid dreaming.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:90%
This is cool.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.837 align:middle line:84%
After a few months,
I entered into

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
my first long-term relationship
with an amazing partner

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.858 align:middle line:90%
in which I am very happy.

00:06:47.858 --> 00:06:50.400 align:middle line:84%
At first, I thought I wanted to
pursue a completely different

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:90%
profession.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
But after one month, my
resolve for my current passion

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
strengthened and I'm achieving
better results than ever in it.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful that I
discovered the heart wall

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:90%
and had it released.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.740 align:middle line:84%
93% of people in this world
have this phenomenon going on.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:90%
This heart wall phenomenon.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, let's go into
this because we now have all

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
this stuff, this whole
new body of challenge kind

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:84%
of that's been inculcated into
our fear base and into the deep

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
memory, the subconscious,
and so forth.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how you start
working with people when they

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
have this kind of mass mental
trauma and someone comes to you

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and says, I can't talk
to my family anymore.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:90%
I am so depressed.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Where do you begin
with them now?

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Well,
think about a glass.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:90%
We'll use this cup.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And let's imagine that this
cup is your being, your energy

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:90%
body, your physical body.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And let's imagine that that cup
has emotional baggage in it.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And that emotional
baggage, some of it

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.643 align:middle line:84%
is from when you
were a kid and used

00:07:49.643 --> 00:07:51.060 align:middle line:84%
to cry yourself
to sleep at night.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.768 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is from
when your parents were

00:07:52.768 --> 00:07:53.963 align:middle line:90%
arguing when you were young.

00:07:53.963 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is the
break up you had

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:90%
in junior high in high school.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is the divorce
that you went through.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.355 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is the
bad work situation

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that you went
through, and so on.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is most people

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:84%
have a cup that is most
of the way full already

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:90%
with emotional baggage.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:90%
And a pandemic comes along.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And then all of this political
intrigue and everything

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.790 align:middle line:90%
comes along.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
there's no place

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:84%
for that emotional
baggage now to really go,

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:90%
and so it starts to overflow.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And people then
can't deal with life.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is we start to
remove their emotional baggage

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
so that instead of their cup
running over all the time,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:84%
now they're creating
room so that they

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
can deal with the new emotional
stuff that's coming on.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in The Emotion
Code also in the last chapter,

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
we teach people how to
deal with emotional stuff

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
so that they're not so prone to
develop new emotional baggage.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, why don't
we talk about that for just

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:90%
a moment?

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.495 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll get into the nuts and
bolts of fixing it once you've

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:90%
let it get in there.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: OK.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.552 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Want to talk about
that last chapter for a minute?

00:09:01.552 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Well, absolutely.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
We talk about love
in that chapter,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about the
importance of feeling love

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:90%
and how important it is to--

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and how shifting it can
be for your own energy

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:84%
to just tell people
that you love them.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you tell someone
that you love them, really

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
from your heart, and
anyone can do this,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.530 align:middle line:84%
even if you're not
saying it out loud,

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:84%
your heart sends that energy to
them, their heart picks that up

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and it understands that
on a subconscious level.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Practical example.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Recently, my wife and I
were shopping at Costco.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And you could feel the
panic in everybody.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, I think it was--

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:90%
there was something going on.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.465 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --people
filling up the carts at 9

00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:50.415 align:middle line:90%
o'clock in the morning.

00:09:50.415 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Exactly.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.353 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel the panic.

00:09:53.353 --> 00:09:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Everybody, people are zooming
around faster than I've ever

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.770 align:middle line:84%
seen them go in
their carts and it

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
started to be-- it's an energy
that everybody's giving off

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.627 align:middle line:90%
and I'm starting to absorb that.

00:10:02.627 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm starting to feel it too.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wait a minute,
I don't want to go there.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I just started
to tell people, people that I

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.122 align:middle line:84%
have no idea who they
are, no connection at all,

00:10:13.122 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I just started
telling them, I just

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:84%
look at it them for a moment and
say, I love you just silently.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.770 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you,
within 10 people, I was--

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I was the
highest vibration

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:90%
person in the whole place.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do this.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how powerful
it is and how easily

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and how quickly it
can shift your energy.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: So that's
a great technique.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
One of the other things that
we talk about in the book

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:90%
at the very end is forgiveness.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Because when people do
things that hurt others

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:84%
or when people do
things that hurt us,

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:84%
the natural human tendency
is to withhold forgiveness,

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
because we want to get
even with that person.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're only
hurting ourselves.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Lewis Smedes said
that, "forgiveness

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
is like letting the prisoner
go free only to find out

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:90%
that the prisoner was you."

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And so if there are
people in your life

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
that you need to forgive,
you need to forgive them.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
some people believe

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:84%
that it's enough to just become
indifferent to what they did

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:90%
to you or indifferent to them.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:30.740 align:middle line:90%
But I don't believe that.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I think that you really truly--

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:84%
to really have peace
in your own life,

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.190 align:middle line:84%
you'll never have it
until you forgive.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you need
to forgive yourself.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.835 align:middle line:84%
And that's the person that
needs it the most sometimes.

00:11:44.835 --> 00:11:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very true.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
speaking these words,

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I've always had an
odd relationship--

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and I know my husband's
called me on it, he said,

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
you don't believe
in forgiveness?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't in the
classic sense of the word

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:03.970 align:middle line:84%
because the way my being
works is what I do instead

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:84%
is I go into and try to walk
in their shoes emotionally

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and understand, really try to
understand what the factors are

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
in their life that would
take them to that point,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to do the thing that was
hurtful or painful or whatever.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And I find that
no forgiveness is

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:84%
needed if you can
understand why someone was

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:90%
motivated to do what they do.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think to take the
time to really understand

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:84%
another person or the
classic walk a mile

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:84%
in someone else's shoes
is really critical

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and it almost eliminates
the need to even have

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:90%
to go through any forgiveness.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.400 align:middle line:90%
It's understood.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:90%
It's understanding.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.492 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: That's a great point.

00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And everyone has to
decide how they want to deal

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:84%
with it because a lot of times,
forgiveness is I'm holding this

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:90%
over you but I forgive you.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:84%
There's something
missing in that for me.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Yeah.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I would rather
understand the person.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: I think that's
absolutely important

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:84%
because if you can understand
what caused them to do

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:90%
the things that they did, then--

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A reaction comes out.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.093 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Well, exactly.

00:13:09.093 --> 00:13:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we need
help to forgive.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, sometimes--

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I had a situation in
my life where I was--

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I felt very wronged by some
people that were close to me.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't feel
like I would ever

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
be able to associate
with them again.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and I felt like it was beyond my
ability to be able to forgive.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did is I gave
it back to the higher power,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and I said, God, if
you want me to be

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
able to work with these
people in the future,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:84%
you're going to need to help me
to forgive them because I'm not

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.930 align:middle line:90%
able to do it on my own.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was a fascinating thing.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I offered that prayer
about three times.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And on the morning of
the third day, I woke up

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:90%
and it was all gone.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.362 align:middle line:84%
And God had just taken
it out of my being.

00:13:57.362 --> 00:13:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, there
you go and that's grace.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Because to continue
this thought,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:84%
there are things people
do that are self-motivated

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and just pure
greed, for example.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
People will screw each other
out over for greedy purposes

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.107 align:middle line:90%
which is not acceptable.

00:14:14.107 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no way to kind
of look at that and justify it.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:84%
You could say, OK, maybe you
didn't have enough growing up.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I'm kind of
contradicting myself now here.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond
that, if you think,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:84%
God, I've looked
at this every way.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:84%
That's just greed
and that's not fair.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the way
I'd go about it is,

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to that
person and reconcile this.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can't always
get reconciliation

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:84%
because that person may not
feel that they're necessarily

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:84%
operating out of greed or
selfishness or whatnot.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So they're not going
to see it in themselves

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going to have
a reasonable conversation.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's where my way
of doing things absolutely

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.680 align:middle line:84%
fails because you can't
truly understand why

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:90%
someone would do these things.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So then that's where yours
comes in as very beautiful

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and offering grace into the
situation when understanding

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.942 align:middle line:90%
is impossible.

00:15:06.942 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Well, you know
the reality of it is,

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.325 align:middle line:90%
we all need to be forgiven.

00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, we
all have our stuff.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:13.783 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Don't we?

00:15:13.783 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
We all do things that
looking back that we regret.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
We all do things that now we
wouldn't even think of doing

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
but that we did when
we were younger.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:84%
We all have things that
we need forgiveness for.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, to me, that's
what helps me to motivate--

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there but for the
grace of God go right.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I should forgive anybody
and everybody in my life

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.918 align:middle line:90%
because I need that myself.

00:15:40.918 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And we all do.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.412 align:middle line:90%
We all need that grace.

00:15:43.412 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:84%
We all need that grace where
we've lied to ourselves,

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
for example, and we've
hoodwinked ourselves

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and justified things
in our own name.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- thank you for
bringing this last chapter

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:90%
of the book up.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really important we
have this little conversation.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.782 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: It's a good chapter.

00:15:56.782 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, let's go on to
working with the heart while

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:90%
in particular right now.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:84%
What happens and how
one starts that process?

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:90%
And what one can expect to see?

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when it
doesn't work so well, what

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.870 align:middle line:90%
is going on there?

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Well, first
of all, of course,

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:84%
we have a network of
practitioners that work

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:84%
remotely and live and in
person in 80 countries around

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.513 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:10%
And so you can go to
our website and you

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.638 align:middle line:10%
can find somebody
to work with you,

00:16:24.638 --> 00:16:26.830 align:middle line:10%
or you can do this yourself.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:10%
And that's one of the
beautiful things about it.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we really
encourage people to do

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:90%
is get the book.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not expensive.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
start working with it.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: It's
available everywhere.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.005 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Start
working with it.

00:16:38.005 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Learn the fundamentals of it.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you can start to remove
your own emotional baggage

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and clear the heat wall
from your own self.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.050 align:middle line:90%
And families do that.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
It changes the family
dynamics entirely.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Teams of creative
people do this.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And it changes the
ability of the team

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:90%
to create synergistically.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.805 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to create
more than they otherwise

00:16:59.805 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:90%
would have been able to.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.220 align:middle line:90%
But it's just a process.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Getting rid of emotional
baggage is something

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.454 align:middle line:90%
that we can all do.

00:17:08.454 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's so simple that
kids can learn how to do it.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:90%
And they are.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're having really
good success around the world.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, OK, so give
us an idea what that looks like

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.337 align:middle line:90%
as a little kid.

00:17:17.337 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Give us the kid
version of it and what

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:90%
they would do in this process.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Well, for example--

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Say so-and-so stole
your stuff and you popped him

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:90%
one, [CHUCKLES] as a kid.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: OK, well, basically
we use muscle testing.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.933 align:middle line:84%
And so if you were
another child and--

00:17:35.933 --> 00:17:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm mad because
you stole my stuff.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Yeah, OK, well, we
might have to reconcile that

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:84%
first, then maybe clear the
emotional baggage later.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.505 align:middle line:90%
Well, a great example--

00:17:51.505 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if
I told this story

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.955 align:middle line:84%
on one of the other
shows, but there

00:17:54.955 --> 00:17:56.330 align:middle line:84%
was a woman who
told me the story

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.417 align:middle line:84%
that she got "The Emotion
Code" and started reading it.

00:18:00.417 --> 00:18:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And then her son started
reading it and listening to it.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.947 align:middle line:84%
And he started practicing
with his friends.

00:18:04.947 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't pay
too much attention.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.123 align:middle line:90%
But a couple of weeks went by.

00:18:08.123 --> 00:18:09.290 align:middle line:90%
And one day the phone rings.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:90%
And she picks up the phone.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's a woman on the
other end of the phone line

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:84%
who identifies herself
as the mother of one

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:90%
of her son's friends.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.927 align:middle line:84%
And she says, listen, your son's
been doing this emotional thing

00:18:18.927 --> 00:18:19.760 align:middle line:90%
with the other boys.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I thought
it was kind of cute.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.722 align:middle line:84%
But she said, I have
to tell you something,

00:18:22.722 --> 00:18:25.610 align:middle line:84%
she said, my son has a
severe phobia of water.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.960 align:middle line:84%
You can have a
phobia to anything.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
She said, this has been
very disruptive to our life

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and his life.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And we've tried everything,
taken him to everybody.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Nothing has ever fixed this.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.785 align:middle line:84%
She said, right now, I'm
at the community pool.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:84%
My son's out
playing in the water

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
with the other boys for the
first time in his whole life.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.637 align:middle line:84%
She said, what is
your son doing?

00:18:43.637 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:90%
How is this even possible?

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Your son did this.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.417 align:middle line:84%
Those two boys are
only 11 years old.

00:18:48.417 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So what it would
look like, basically,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.070 align:middle line:84%
in a case like that is
we'll say that you're

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.480 align:middle line:90%
the boy with the phobia.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.053 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other boy might
have said, hold out your arm.

00:19:01.053 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And then he might have said,
do you have a trapped emotion

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:84%
that we can release that's
contributing to your phobia

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:84%
or that's causing
your phobia of water?

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer
was strong for yes,

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.450 align:middle line:84%
then he would have had
The Emotion Code chart.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And he would have
asked, OK, is this--

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and there's 60
emotions in the chart.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:90%
There's two columns, six rows.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And he would have said, is
the emotion in column A?

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was in column B. Is
it in one of the odd rows?

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Maybe no.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, maybe it's in row 2, row 4.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, is it this or this?

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's panic.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So then do we need to
know more about this?

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.258 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have to
figure out a little more.

00:19:37.258 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
But then it's just a matter of
swiping with a hand or a magnet

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
down the back, down
the governing meridian.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.662 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
about all it took.

00:19:44.662 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: [CHUCKLES]

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I mean,
that is really simple.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So something else
is coming up here.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
This is based on
personal experience

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I had, years ago,
when I was doing

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.730 align:middle line:90%
some hypnotherapy years ago.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:90%
And I was working with a client.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking
for enhanced performance

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:90%
in the world of saber fencing.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
They were ranked 66th in
the country or something

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:90%
in the 40s-and-over division.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.020 align:middle line:90%
And they wanted to go for it.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, I
started doing sessions.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.770 align:middle line:90%
This person trusted me.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you mind
if we do it silently?

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Same thing you're
talking about basically.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we were using
ideomotor response.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
But like you talked
about projecting love

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.010 align:middle line:84%
to people in Costco,
is it possible

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.750 align:middle line:84%
that we can do
exactly what you're

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:84%
talking about if we have the
book and the page in front

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:30.300 align:middle line:90%
of us?

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And saying, if you
trust me on this,

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and then just you ask the
question of them mind to mind.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And that way it can bypass any
preconceived notions they have.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Yes, you
can totally do that.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You can.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to play with that
and see what kind of results.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:90%
This guy did great.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
He went to sixth in
the country on a couple

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:90%
of these silent sessions.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:54.395 align:middle line:84%
It was so powerful because his
mind was never involved in it.

00:20:54.395 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Yeah,
and that's fine.

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:90%
And you can do that as well.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.742 align:middle line:90%
You can ask questions vocally.

00:20:59.742 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:90%
You can ask them non-vocally.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It works at a distance, works
at any distance, doesn't matter.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's just so direct.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So now what happens if
you're a practitioner working

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:90%
with the person at home?

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Are they doing their own
muscle testing or using

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:90%
another divination device?

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.450 align:middle line:90%
How do they do it?

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:19.742 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Yeah, good question.

00:21:19.742 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:84%
The way that it works
is the human body

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
has this amazing ability
that's built right into it

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:84%
to set aside its own needs to
act on behalf of someone else.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.485 align:middle line:84%
And so we call this
working by proxy.

00:21:31.485 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
A proxy is somebody that acts
or stands in for someone else.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the human body
has this ability.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And so essentially what happens
is if I were working on you,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:84%
for example, and let's say
that you're in Budapest,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:84%
what I would do is we don't
have to be on the phone,

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:49.848 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:21:49.848 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:84%
But as long as I
have your permission

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.440 align:middle line:84%
to work on you, at some
point, I could simply--

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
usually how I do it is I'll
just offer a short prayer,

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
just ask for divine help
to help me to help you.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll just ask if
I can act as proxy for you.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'll muscle test myself.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:90%
If I get a yes on that, great.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what's so interesting
is that, normally, of course,

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
strength is yes and
weaknesses no in muscle

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:90%
testing the way we teach it.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And normally if I were to
say, "my name is Brad--"

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.250 align:middle line:84%
my name is Brad--
that would be strong.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:84%
But when the proxy
connection gets made,

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:27.090 align:middle line:84%
it's a wireless connection that
is so profound that if I say,

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
at that point, when the
connection is made, if I say,

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.570 align:middle line:84%
"my name is Regina," it's
strong, and "my name is Brad,"

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.502 align:middle line:90%
that would be weak.

00:22:35.502 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, at that
point, what I can

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
do is I can go ahead, since
I'm acting on your behalf,

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask questions,
I'll get answers,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and I can use The Body
Code or The Emotion Code,

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:84%
find whatever
imbalances are going on,

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.678 align:middle line:84%
and clear those on myself,
and they clear from you.

00:22:48.678 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we're done,
we just break the connection

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:90%
and that's how it's done.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:90%
It's really easy.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, we
know, historically,

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.087 align:middle line:84%
even though it can be a little
messier and less understood

00:22:58.087 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and not even have
protocols around it,

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
we know that people have
impacted people at a distance

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:90%
in healing.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has historically
always been true,

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:90%
remote healing.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:07.847 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Absolutely.

00:23:07.847 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this is just a
type of remote healing that is

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.580 align:middle line:84%
very specific, where you
can go through layers of it.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you can target what
the pinpoint underlying

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:90%
factors are.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Where with another remote
healing, you might get a call,

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.310 align:middle line:84%
somebody's just fallen
from the second story

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're on the ground
and just do something.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not very specific.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.962 align:middle line:84%
So this is really beautiful
in its specificity.

00:23:33.962 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Well, it is.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.442 align:middle line:84%
And you know, what we
tell our students is,

00:23:38.442 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
the first time that you're
on the phone with somebody

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.817 align:middle line:84%
and they're several states
or several countries away

00:23:42.817 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:84%
or on the other
side of the planet

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and you release something
from them using The Body

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Code or The Emotion Code and
their pain level goes from a 9

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:54.030 align:middle line:84%
to a 0 in a heartbeat, then, in
that moment, your life changes

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.960 align:middle line:84%
because you realize that,
yeah, this actually does work.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
quantum physics really.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And quantum entanglement.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Exactly.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It's about entanglement and
collapsing the wave function

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.220 align:middle line:90%
and all of those things.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.387 align:middle line:84%
But it's just the practical
application of all that.

00:24:08.387 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Thank goodness we
understand it now.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm sure,
a number of years

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.047 align:middle line:84%
ago, when you first
got going, you

00:24:14.047 --> 00:24:15.330 align:middle line:90%
had a lot of 'splaining to do.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: That's exactly right.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You don't have
to explain so much to this

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:90%
audience.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:84%
We're up to speed on
that one, I think.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.543 align:middle line:84%
Now we just have to use it,
validate it for ourselves.

00:24:22.543 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
You were saying
earlier, people can have

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.040 align:middle line:90%
an allergy to almost anything.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.852 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking off camera.

00:24:27.852 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And you said there
was one lady who

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:90%
had an allergy to making money.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to share
that story with us?

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.497 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm sure there are
a lot of people right now

00:24:35.497 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:90%
that can relate.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.985 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Yeah, this
is a great story.

00:24:39.985 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
This is from a woman named
Anne Heshan from Rhode Island.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.670 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Before I started
working with The Body Code,

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I had been
self-employed for many.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I had created some
success, but I just

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:84%
kept bumping up against
an income barrier

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that I could never
seem to get past."

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:90%
That ring a bell for anybody?

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.940 align:middle line:84%
"Using The Body Code,
I decided to see

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
if it could help me
finally break through

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:90%
in this area of my life.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I was immediately led
to an idea "allergy."

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.910 align:middle line:84%
You can be allergic to anything,
including ideas, we have found.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And with a little testing,
I was able to figure out

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that this idea allergy boiled
down to a subconscious belief

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that if I made a lot of money,
it would ruin my marriage.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I cleared that idea allergy with
three quick swipes--" so just

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.620 align:middle line:84%
like this, of a
magnet or her hand.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.300 align:middle line:84%
"I had no idea how
quickly I would

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
see the results of
removing that one block.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:84%
In less than a month, my
income more than doubled

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and I finally achieved and
went over a monthly income

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.593 align:middle line:84%
goal I had been chasing and
never hitting for years.

00:25:34.593 --> 00:25:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And what's more, in the
six months since then,

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
my monthly income has
not once gone down

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.595 align:middle line:84%
below that goal I had
chased for so long.

00:25:41.595 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:84%
"Meanwhile, I just celebrated
my 25th wedding anniversary

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:84%
where my awesome husband
and I renewed our vows.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It's extraordinary the
difference it made in my life

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:84%
using The Body Code on
that abundance block."

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Anne Heshan, Rhode Island.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.645 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:25:54.645 --> 00:25:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: [CHUCKLES]

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, now how do you
distinguish an idea allergy

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:84%
to just a kind of
corrupt, firmly held,

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:05.995 align:middle line:90%
subconscious belief.

00:26:05.995 --> 00:26:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Well, we let the
subconscious mind figure that

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.210 align:middle line:84%
We let the subconscious mind
do all the heavy lifting.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So with The Body Code, what we
have is, if you can imagine,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:84%
a hierarchical mind map that
actually runs in your phone.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of it is
because the subconscious mind

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:84%
is immersed in and
is fully connected

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to the database of
universal intelligence,

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious
mind of every person

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.490 align:middle line:84%
knows exactly what
is in The Body Code.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So when we're trying to find
an imbalance with somebody--

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.970 align:middle line:84%
like let's say, for example,
that you're stuck in abundance

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
create more whatever.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.550 align:middle line:84%
What we would do is,
using The Body Code,

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:52.200 align:middle line:84%
we would simply ask
your subconscious mind,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.870 align:middle line:90%
with this chart in mind--

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.550 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a
massive database--

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.850 align:middle line:84%
we would ask, is there
an underlying reason

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:90%
why you're blocked about this?

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.502 align:middle line:84%
And then we simply ask,
using muscle testing,

00:27:06.502 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
is the imbalance on the
right side of the chart

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.835 align:middle line:84%
or on the left
side of the chart?

00:27:09.835 --> 00:27:13.073 align:middle line:84%
And then we very rapidly can
drill down to what it is.

00:27:13.073 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a
trapped emotion,

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.907 align:middle line:84%
it could be some
kind of a trauma,

00:27:15.907 --> 00:27:17.790 align:middle line:90%
it could be an idea allergy.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
things it could be.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of
it, you see, is

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.760 align:middle line:84%
that your subconscious
mind, the subconscious

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.410 align:middle line:84%
mind of every single
person, knows,

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:30.780 align:middle line:84%
with a perfect understanding,
what is really going on in them

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and what's really
going on with them.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And what's really blocking them,
what their real deficiencies

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.910 align:middle line:84%
are as far as
vitamins and minerals,

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:90%
the subconscious knows.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.223 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious knows what
emotional baggage you have.

00:27:43.223 --> 00:27:44.640 align:middle line:84%
It knows if you've
got a parasite.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.990 align:middle line:90%
It knows if you've got viruses.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It knows about everything
with a perfect comprehension.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So all we do is we
just use this mapping

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%
system to ask these questions
and drill down and then delete

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and remove things or add things
that might need to be added.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In the quantum field.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Exactly.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You just
brought this up a bit ago.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.750 align:middle line:90%
We were talking about data.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:08.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, so your other profession
was in the computer industry.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And so here we're looking
at a computer metaphor.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And so how does our subconscious
and mind work, in a sense,

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.450 align:middle line:84%
as a cloud and sort through this
massive amount of data and then

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:84%
pinpoint the data
point that needs

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:90%
to be reflected back to us?

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Well, what I've
learned is to just trust it.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the subconscious
mind is this computer

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:90%
that we can't really comprehend.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And like I said before, it
knows everything that we need.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's how,
in my practice, I

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:84%
was able to help people who
had been told that there

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:90%
was no cure for them.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can
imagine, for 10 years,

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I was primarily
working with people

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.860 align:middle line:84%
that have been told
there was no hope at all.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And yet I knew I had a
secret weapon because I could

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:90%
ask their subconscious mind.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.335 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that this
is the future of healing.

00:29:00.335 --> 00:29:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I
do too, totally.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: It really is.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.202 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Because every
single person has this massive

00:29:05.202 --> 00:29:06.040 align:middle line:90%
database.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And as a computer
programmer, when

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I went to chiropractic
school, I can

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:90%
remember sitting in my classes.

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And my instructors
would say things

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.180 align:middle line:84%
like, the brain is the
most amazing computer

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.102 align:middle line:90%
that we know of.

00:29:16.102 --> 00:29:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember sitting
there thinking, wow,

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:84%
will we ever be able to
actually tap into it?

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.230 align:middle line:84%
What if we could tap in and
then access all that data?

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what we
do now with The Body Code

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and with The Emotion Code too.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:84%
But The Emotion Code is
included in The Body Code.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.417 align:middle line:84%
The Body Code is the
system that I put together.

00:29:35.417 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:84%
There are really six
different kinds of imbalances

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that we suffer from
that create all

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:84%
of our mental and physical
and emotional problems.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.115 align:middle line:84%
And so what you can do
is you can simply ask.

00:29:46.115 --> 00:29:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
just trust it, it

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.470 align:middle line:84%
will take you right
to whatever it is.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you release
it or address

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.850 align:middle line:90%
that however you need to.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And all the instructions
are all in there.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is
in the forthcoming book,

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.060 align:middle line:90%
"The Body Code."

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Yeah, "The Body Code"
book is coming out this fall

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:90%
sometime.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be an
overview of The Body Code.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:09.780 align:middle line:84%
The Body Code
system itself, if we

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.310 align:middle line:84%
were to publish it in a book,
it would be about this thick.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
But you also developed an
app that has all that in it.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: That's the app that
had-- yeah, it's all digital.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:17.235 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.235 --> 00:30:18.005 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can get
interfaces with it.

00:30:18.005 --> 00:30:18.922 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so you got that.

00:30:18.922 --> 00:30:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So people can interface with
it whichever way they wish.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And so you've just clearly
defined these six categories

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.380 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get into
one of them about healing.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.360 align:middle line:84%
We were just talking
for a brief moment,

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.485 align:middle line:84%
off camera, which is you had
an experience around viruses.

00:30:34.485 --> 00:30:35.610 align:middle line:90%
And that matters right now.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I think, for the
first time, humanity at large

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.450 align:middle line:84%
is reading about viruses
[CHUCKLES] since the pandemic

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and since we have so much
access to information.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of
information, misinformation,

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:84%
we don't understand what
we're reading a lot of times.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So what was your
experience with viruses

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.020 align:middle line:90%
that can help clarify this?

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Well, this was
something that was totally

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:57.900 align:middle line:90%
unexpected.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.460 align:middle line:84%
But you know, of course I
studied viruses in biology

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and went through
chiropractic school

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and everything else, like
so many other people.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So one day, I had been
in practice for a while,

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and a woman came in
to me and she said,

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I've been diagnosed
with Epstein-Barr virus.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.150 align:middle line:90%


00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:90%
And so I want you to help me.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.750 align:middle line:90%
So I started thinking about it.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the habit of
asking for help from the divine,

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:84%
from God, however
you refer to it,

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.332 align:middle line:90%
with each person that I saw.

00:31:28.332 --> 00:31:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was a totally private,
totally personal habit.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.998 align:middle line:84%
Before I go to work on somebody,
I would just take a moment

00:31:32.998 --> 00:31:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and just say, yeah, I
need some help here.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
thinking about this.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.476 align:middle line:90%
And I just offered this prayer.

00:31:40.476 --> 00:31:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Father, if
there's a better way

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.300 align:middle line:84%
to deal with this
will you please

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:90%
help me to understand it.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden I had this
download, this understanding

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.570 align:middle line:90%
that kind of poured into me.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.370 align:middle line:90%
And here's what it was.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:32:01.140 align:middle line:84%
It basically said,
OK, you can think

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:06.810 align:middle line:84%
of a virus as little organisms
like in traditional biology.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Or another way to
think of a virus

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:84%
is to think of it
as just pure energy,

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.240 align:middle line:84%
like a cloud of energy,
which is also valid.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:84%
It's valid on both
sides of that.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Just as we are.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.023 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Just as we are.

00:32:19.023 --> 00:32:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you can think of a
virus as a cloud of energy,

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.120 align:middle line:84%
then it frees your mind
to be able to manipulate

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.480 align:middle line:84%
that cloud of energy
like you'd remove

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:84%
a trapped emotion
or anything else.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.530 align:middle line:90%
So I was able to help that lady.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.197 align:middle line:84%
And then I had another
interesting thing

00:32:36.197 --> 00:32:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that happened to me that
taught me about this.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.680 align:middle line:84%
This woman came
in to me one day.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And her complaint
was she had a cough.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And when she would
breathe in deep,

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.850 align:middle line:84%
she'd start coughing
uncontrollably.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:51.495 align:middle line:84%
And so I tested her and
found she had a virus that

00:32:51.495 --> 00:32:52.620 align:middle line:90%
had settled into her lungs.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:90%
It was a common cold virus.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I released it from
her, just thinking this way,

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:90%
removing it as an energy.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.623 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, try it now.

00:33:03.623 --> 00:33:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And she took a deep breath,
and it was totally fine.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:06.520 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't believe it.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.140 align:middle line:90%
She was just raving.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.400 align:middle line:90%
It was like a miracle, right?

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I walk out with
her, out to the front desk.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:90%
And she's so happy.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:90%
And she says goodbye.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I walked
back down the hall

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.860 align:middle line:90%
and into my treatment room.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And as I walked
through the door,

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.330 align:middle line:90%
something entered my body.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I felt something
come into my body.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:24.450 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
started coughing.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: And I
took a deep breath.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.043 align:middle line:84%
And I started coughing
uncontrollably.

00:33:28.043 --> 00:33:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh no.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Now, listen, in
terms of Western medicine

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and biology, that
makes no sense at all.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:10%
Because a virus has to hijack
the machinery of the cell

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.350 align:middle line:10%
and take over and
reproduce more viruses.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But what I learned was it's
really all just energy.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able to
release that from myself.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was fine, so
I mean immediately.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But that taught me another
powerful lesson about our world

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and the reality of our
existence is that we

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.550 align:middle line:90%
are beings of pure energy.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And everything else is energy
too, including viruses.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that you can
at least weaken a viral energy

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.719 align:middle line:90%
that is in your body.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But viewing things
in this way is really

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.245 align:middle line:90%
a higher level of thinking.

00:34:17.245 --> 00:34:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or even ask the
virus to work in companionship

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.585 align:middle line:90%
and harmony with you.

00:34:20.585 --> 00:34:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: You
can even try that.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I mean, try it.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:23.330 align:middle line:90%
What the heck.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so much of
this-- the mind.

00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Exactly.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:26.603 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The mind.

00:34:26.603 --> 00:34:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are
not, I don't think,

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:32.820 align:middle line:84%
anywhere near the
stage of understanding

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.659 align:middle line:84%
the incredible power of
each and every thought

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:36.659 align:middle line:90%
that passes through us--

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: I
couldn't agree more.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and its impact
on ourselves and the entire

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.170 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:45.600 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about placebo.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.945 align:middle line:84%
If a person comes to you
and they-- you're the guy.

00:34:47.945 --> 00:34:49.320 align:middle line:84%
You're the one
that created this.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.340 align:middle line:90%
They're coming to you.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.540 align:middle line:90%
They're expecting.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.630 align:middle line:84%
How much of it is
the expectation

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.310 align:middle line:84%
being met because
they're open to it

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and the mind is ready to
receive this shift now?

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.045 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Well, you know,
that's a great question.

00:35:01.045 --> 00:35:03.300 align:middle line:84%
When I was in practice,
I tried to screen

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.820 align:middle line:84%
for people who
really truly believed

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.350 align:middle line:90%
that they couldn't get well.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.625 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of my
patients were people

00:35:09.625 --> 00:35:11.250 align:middle line:84%
that had been told
that they were never

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:12.390 align:middle line:84%
going to get better,
that they were

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:13.871 align:middle line:84%
going to be sick for
the rest of their lives.

00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:15.704 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they had
a firmly-held belief.

00:35:15.704 --> 00:35:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: The people who really
truly incorporated that belief,

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:24.600 align:middle line:84%
it seemed that no matter what I
did, they wouldn't get better.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think that really
just about any doctor

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:31.470 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that a person has
to have some level of belief

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:33.750 align:middle line:90%
in order for things to work.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just a little
openness to say it's possible.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Exactly.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes that's all you need.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because in
the Bible, in the New Testament,

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I've always liked the
story where Jesus is out

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.915 align:middle line:84%
changing water to wine and
giving sight back to people

00:35:48.915 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and healing the
lepers and so on.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But he goes back
to his hometown.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And it says that he can't
do any miracles there

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.932 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
believe that he was--

00:35:56.932 --> 00:35:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He was just a guy.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Yeah, oh, that's the
kid that broke my window with

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:90%
his baseball or whatever.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.943 align:middle line:84%
And so in spite of
how powerful he was,

00:36:04.943 --> 00:36:06.360 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't do any
miracles there,

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.385 align:middle line:84%
which I've always
thought was interesting.

00:36:07.385 --> 00:36:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's interesting.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, so here's one of
the big questions.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:90%
We have this perfect mechanism.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.600 align:middle line:84%
We have this powerful,
powerful mind.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We have a body
and a subconscious

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:84%
that is able to diagnose and
contend with almost anything.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It can find the truth
and the data for us.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.400 align:middle line:84%
We have a higher mind that
can set an intention in motion

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that's capable of fixing
pretty much anything,

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:90%
what we call miracles.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.840 align:middle line:90%
All of it's there.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.070 align:middle line:90%
We possess all of it.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:90%
And a body set up to self-heal.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.920 align:middle line:90%
And yet look how sick we are.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So why is this information
kind of so remote and seemingly

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.370 align:middle line:90%
hidden from us?

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Well, I think that
in the same way that we've kind

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:84%
of become disconnected
from each other,

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:06.060 align:middle line:84%
especially over the last
year or so, many people are

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:12.640 align:middle line:84%
disconnected from the higher
power, many people are also--

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.640 align:middle line:90%
how can we say this?

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.200 align:middle line:84%
The problem is there are all
of these vested interests.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And the old saying about
conventional wisdom

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.140 align:middle line:84%
is that if it's
conventional wisdom,

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.990 align:middle line:84%
it's probably been
bought and paid for.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the things
that most people tend

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:35.700 align:middle line:84%
to believe as being true, if
they were to actually analyze

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.990 align:middle line:84%
those beliefs to see where
those have really come from

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and who was funding
those beliefs,

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.370 align:middle line:84%
then I think that that
is a place to start,

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:84%
where we need to shift our
systems of absorbing knowledge.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
need to start really

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.860 align:middle line:84%
looking inward and
trusting our own intuition

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.270 align:middle line:84%
as the highest and the best
guidance that we can get.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:11.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, the story that
I just told about, asking for

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.740 align:middle line:90%
help to understand viruses.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.670 align:middle line:90%
And that information came to me.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
If I hadn't asked
for that help, I

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.493 align:middle line:84%
would have lived my entire
life and never probably would

00:38:19.493 --> 00:38:22.950 align:middle line:90%
have understood that really.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.693 align:middle line:84%
So I think that if
we ask, we receive.

00:38:25.693 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:27.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what I find.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.940 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to higher
guidance, a lot of times

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.980 align:middle line:84%
my biggest mistake
is I forget to ask.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.132 align:middle line:84%
I'll go years without
asking something,

00:38:34.132 --> 00:38:35.340 align:middle line:90%
even if I'm curious about it.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.757 align:middle line:84%
You never think
to maybe just ask.

00:38:36.757 --> 00:38:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I ask, it's
like, oh my god, thank you.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.440 align:middle line:90%
That was easy.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't I ask
a few years ago?

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: I know.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.730 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:46.800 align:middle line:84%
We're silly, silly
things, ninnymuggins.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.260 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:90%
There's something else.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that I personally

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:55.500 align:middle line:84%
observe and I have
noticed and I certainly

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.240 align:middle line:90%
notice in my own life.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is, as long as we
have desire, as long as we

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.870 align:middle line:90%
have desire that leads toward--

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean desire like
I want to pop another beer

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:10.110 align:middle line:84%
or have another
cookie, I mean a desire

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:14.350 align:middle line:84%
that's coming from somewhere
else and we follow it.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And it can be something
simple, like you

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:84%
know what, I'm going to
go see my grandma today.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, that makes me happy
to think of making her happy.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Or it's like, for me, I
have this fierce desire

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:29.400 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover
truth wherever I can,

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.930 align:middle line:90%
anywhere and everywhere I can.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And that keeps me
going in my career.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:37.215 align:middle line:84%
Because even if I'm getting
tired on some level or

00:39:37.215 --> 00:39:39.090 align:middle line:84%
have been doing the same
job for a long time,

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:42.330 align:middle line:84%
that spark of desire
doesn't change.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Even simple desires to just--

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I want to have some
people over for dinner.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll make a
beautiful dish for them.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.640 align:middle line:84%
As long as we have
desire, it seems to me

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.150 align:middle line:84%
that that's the kind of thing
that refreshes the spirit

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and allows for
these other things

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.090 align:middle line:84%
to continue working
well together.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And once our desire
goes, once the joy goes,

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.950 align:middle line:84%
once the flame goes down,
none of these other systems

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.200 align:middle line:90%
really seem to work that well.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And we get old.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Mm-hmm, I think so.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, we are children
of the divine.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.843 align:middle line:84%
And the divine is
all about creation.

00:40:16.843 --> 00:40:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Creativity.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.927 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Yeah, creativity.

00:40:18.927 --> 00:40:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens to people
if they retire and they

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.960 align:middle line:84%
stop creating, well,
they wither away.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They do.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: And they die.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, I think
that that's really

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.610 align:middle line:84%
an absolutely powerful key
to maintaining your sanity

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:37.620 align:middle line:84%
but also to developing
your own happiness and joy,

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.820 align:middle line:90%
is to keep creating.

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're right, it can
just be little things.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.480 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to be huge things.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.980 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want
to stop creating.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Daily,
regularly, little things.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.208 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Little things.

00:40:47.208 --> 00:40:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you
mentioned something

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:54.330 align:middle line:84%
about having that little
thought to do something creative

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:57.070 align:middle line:90%
or to serve someone in some way.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for us now
especially to be open to those,

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.828 align:middle line:84%
to listen to those, and
to get those answers.

00:41:03.828 --> 00:41:06.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's interesting,
because in the work that we

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.260 align:middle line:84%
do when we teach people how
to do muscle testing and so

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.287 align:middle line:84%
on, what we teach them
is, when you're doing

00:41:12.287 --> 00:41:14.370 align:middle line:84%
this work with The Emotion
Code and The Body Code,

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:15.660 align:middle line:90%
it won't take long.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have an
experience where,

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.130 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, a moment
before you get

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:21.630 align:middle line:84%
the answer on muscle
testing, you'll

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.250 align:middle line:90%
know the answer in your heart.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because you've
already put the intention out.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: And that's
your intuition.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you feed that,
you can get to a point

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.540 align:middle line:84%
where you really don't
need muscle testing.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.340 align:middle line:84%
You can just do it
all by intuition.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.473 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You know.

00:41:33.473 --> 00:41:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Then you're in a
state of knowing.

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Exactly right.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.818 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then you get
enough validation and you

00:41:37.818 --> 00:41:39.970 align:middle line:84%
understand to trust
that place of knowing.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: And so I think
that that's a big part of why

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.010 align:middle line:84%
we're here, is to learn how to
trust that little inner voice,

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:49.090 align:middle line:84%
the voice that comes
from the light.

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we continue
to follow that,

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:55.118 align:middle line:84%
we gradually ascend and get
to higher and higher planes.

00:41:55.118 --> 00:41:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Couldn't agree more.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:57.810 align:middle line:90%
We're on the same page.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.153 align:middle line:84%
OK, I have a big
question here for you.

00:42:00.153 --> 00:42:02.070 align:middle line:84%
If you were going to
start, based on all this,

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:04.690 align:middle line:84%
a movement that would benefit
the most people on the planet--

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:06.565 align:middle line:84%
I know this is kind of
near and dear to you--

00:42:06.565 --> 00:42:08.310 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.955 align:middle line:90%
What would that look like?

00:42:09.955 --> 00:42:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NELSON: Well, it's the
movement that we're doing right

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.070 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:84%
It's opening people's minds,
it's opening people's hearts,

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.720 align:middle line:84%
It's giving back to every man,
woman, and child on this planet

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.200 align:middle line:84%
the healing birthright
that belongs to them.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone has
the ability to heal--

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:84%
to heal themselves, to
heal their family members,

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.310 align:middle line:90%
their loved ones.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's never been anything
as simple as The Emotion

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Code and The Body Code, never
been anything as comprehensive

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:42.660 align:middle line:84%
as The Body Code that
anyone can learn how to use.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what we're doing,

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:47.100 align:middle line:84%
is giving people
back that birthright.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a great
question, though.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.322 align:middle line:84%
But that is exactly
what we're doing.

00:42:50.322 --> 00:42:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful to be
doing what I believe I'm really

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:55.260 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be doing.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and obviously
your energy is clean and clear.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.010 align:middle line:10%
You're very focused and you're
very passionate and very

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.990 align:middle line:10%
committed to what you do.

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:05.470 align:middle line:10%
I sit across from
a lot of people.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people have
an idea and intellectually

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:12.090 align:middle line:90%
can propagate information.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:15.130 align:middle line:84%
But they're not all in,
you know what I mean?

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:17.490 align:middle line:84%
You can tell by someone's
energy when they're all in.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.440 align:middle line:90%
And you're all in, I can tell.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.832 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: You too.

00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Regina.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So any final words
you want to share with us?

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.812 align:middle line:84%
It's been a really interesting
and fun discussion.

00:43:26.812 --> 00:43:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Yeah, it has been.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that it's
always important for everybody

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to remember that there's
the yin and the yang,

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.780 align:middle line:90%
you know, the yin yang symbol.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:40.200 align:middle line:84%
As things seem to get
darker, somewhere things

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.130 align:middle line:90%
are getting lighter.

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.260 align:middle line:10%
Because the light
and the dark always

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.460 align:middle line:10%
stay in a state of balance.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And so don't get too
worried if you're looking

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.400 align:middle line:90%
too much at the darkness.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.160 align:middle line:84%
If the darkness seems to be
going up, look for the light

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.720 align:middle line:90%
because it's increasing too.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're moving
into a marvelous age

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:01.113 align:middle line:84%
where things are going to happen
faster and more powerfully

00:44:01.113 --> 00:44:02.530 align:middle line:84%
than they've ever
happened before.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
blow all of our minds

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:08.070 align:middle line:84%
how easy it becomes to
get answers from above

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:09.630 align:middle line:90%
and to see miracles happen.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just going
to be a really fun time.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.597 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
to look forward to.

00:44:13.597 --> 00:44:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you
so much, Bradley.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:15.780 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NELSON: Thank you, Regina.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:16.785 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:44:16.785 --> 00:44:17.630 align:middle line:90%
It was fun.

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We could all use a
little bit of help these days,

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm absolutely sure.
