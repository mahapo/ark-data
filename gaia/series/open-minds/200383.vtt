00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:20.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
For those of you

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:10%
who have not seen part one of my
conversation with Jack Barsky,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:10%
please hit pause and
go back and watch it.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:84%
If you have, we're going to
pick up the story at the point

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:84%
where Jack has passed all
of the necessary training

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:84%
to become a top notch Soviet
spy embedded illegally

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
We also have joining
us a little bit later

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:90%
Jack's daughter Chelsea.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Chelsea was 19
years old when she

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
learned that her American dad,
Jack Barsky, was a Soviet spy.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Jack, welcome back.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.040 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JACK BARSKY: Good to be back.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm sure
everybody is totally

00:00:50.995 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
hanging on pins and needles to
find out what happened next.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.210 align:middle line:90%
So let's just go right for it.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to recap.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can go watch it.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:90%
So we're picking up now.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Now it's time to
do the trial run

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
to become an American,
which is to Canada.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, meanwhile, I think
we need to explain.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.048 align:middle line:84%
You've already gone
through a couple name

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:84%
changes and everything
during this journey.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And you go through very
circuitous routes of passports

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.437 align:middle line:84%
to one country, swap
them out, burn them.

00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Get another set of passports
in another country.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:90%
You end up in Canada.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
You're starting to observe kind
of the customs of the American

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:90%
or the Western way of life.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.433 align:middle line:90%
Share a little of that.

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened-- which I
teased everyone with at the end

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:90%
of the last show--

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:84%
when it came time to have
a beer with some people

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
and you had never encountered
a twist-off and the terror

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:90%
that ensued.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:10%
So you know, I'm sitting
in a restaurant and--

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:10%
eat some food.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:10%
And the beer was
served in bottles.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.658 align:middle line:10%
Which was unusual--
normally, you know,

00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:10%
you would expect a glass.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:10%
But it's OK.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:10%
So then I asked the waiter
to get me a bottle opener.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:90%
And he asked me why.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And I says, well, I
want to open the bottle.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
with a grin, and he

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.705 align:middle line:84%
thought-- he thought I was
probably trying to tease me.

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:84%
He, with a grin took, the
bottle and then just did this.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:90%
That was a revelation.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.417 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have those.

00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the thing
was you felt busted.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: But I betrayed
my cultural ignorance,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:90%
and that was no good.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
It was an in my face,
hey, be careful.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't know a lot
of details that you

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
need to know if you pretend
to have been born and raised

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.825 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- again,
what was interesting is

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:31.450 align:middle line:84%
the amount of detail that
you would never think of.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.128 align:middle line:84%
As a tourist going
to another country,

00:02:33.128 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:90%
they expect you to be ignorant.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:90%
You're ignorant.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:90%
You learn along the way.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to show, you have

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:84%
to show up as a complete package
that already knows everything

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:90%
about the customs.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was in Canada
on a German passport.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:84%
It was OK for everybody else
to understand that maybe I

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:90%
didn't know everything thing.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.357 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But not you.

00:02:51.357 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: But I was in
training to become an American.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.716 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it was
a big negative for me.

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.480 align:middle line:90%
So Canada passes.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:84%
What did you learn
through that part

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:84%
before you went
back and then made

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:90%
the big entry into America.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Well, I
learned two things that--

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:84%
North America was extremely
rich in terms of overall wealth.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And people were
all very friendly.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like--
you know, you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.895 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel like you
were in enemy territory.

00:03:20.895 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually
looking forward

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
to going to the United
States because I

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:90%
felt like I can operate there.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Nice people now.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: However, you went to
New York City, as it turns out.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's nice.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:90%
It's nice.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:84%
It's nicer now than it
was back then, actually.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:90%
So you go back.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:90%
Now is the big entree.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
be basically dropped.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:90%
You're out of view.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
You have your ways of
communicating with the Center,

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:90%
but you're on your own.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, dropped-- you
can make that case.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was a long, zigzag
path through a number

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%
of countries using a number
of different identities

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that my
presence in the US

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
would not possibly,
could not possibly

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:90%
be traced back to Moscow.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And then I
truly was on my own.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:84%
There was not ever one
meeting with somebody

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.495 align:middle line:84%
from the Center on the
territory of the United States.

00:04:17.495 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were going
to be embedded as an illegal.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.052 align:middle line:84%
Which is, for the
romantic version of it,

00:04:22.052 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:84%
people who've watched
the show "The Americans,"

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.490 align:middle line:84%
they were embedded
as illegals that

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:90%
were controlled by the Center.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.347 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about a little bit of those,

00:04:30.347 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:84%
the fantasy part versus the
parts that had some substance.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But when you first
arrived here, first you

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:90%
had to go through customs.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And that was very nerve
wracking for you just

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.722 align:middle line:84%
to go through
immigration, right?

00:04:43.722 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That was the most
tense moment in my entire life,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
even though rationally,
I had nothing to fear.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I was traveling on
a very well-crafted

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:90%
false Canadian passport.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But I still-- you know, I was
entering the United States.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.995 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
maybe I had KGB--

00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.510 align:middle line:90%
You know what you're there for.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: --in big
letters on my forehead.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was afraid of sort of
just making one dumb mistake

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and giving away that
I may be somebody

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
who should be questioned
a little more in detail.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Look, my luggage
didn't have much in it,

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and it had a shortwave radio.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That could have
triggered some interrogation.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
did get through.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.257 align:middle line:90%
They gave you $7,000, right?

00:05:33.257 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Well, at the
time I entered the US,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:90%
I had about $7,000 left.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
You had $7,000 and
you had, essentially,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
a birth certificate of a
deceased young boy named

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Jack Barsky.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Correct.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.570 align:middle line:90%
That is correct.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they said your
job is now to become legal,

to obtain all the

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: Which, you know,
as an American, you think,

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, you go down and apply.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:84%

journey of getting

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
settled, finding
a little apartment

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, on
limited funds, having

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:90%
to find a job with no ID.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: With no track
record of prior employment.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nothing.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No marketable skills.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No marketable skills.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.842 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And my chemistry
past I couldn't take with me.

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You couldn't take
your illustrious past with you.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Nope.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which, you would
have been a tenured professor

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:84%
by that point, or on
your way to tenure--

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That's right.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.633 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --you know, in Europe.

00:06:32.633 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So you ended up getting a job as
a messenger, bicycle messenger

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
boy in New York
City, rushing around

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
in rain and snow and sleet
and hail and sunshine.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
journey of getting your ID.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So this was all very well
planned by the Center,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't know
what they didn't know.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And they had no idea
that the very first step

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.167 align:middle line:90%
was the most difficult one.

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:90%
You just get a library card.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.662 align:middle line:84%
And with a birth certificate
and a library card,

00:07:04.662 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
you can now get a
driver's license.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Easy.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyone can
get a library card.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.183 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: One, two, three.

00:07:09.183 --> 00:07:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.730 align:middle line:84%
At the library, at the public
library, they asked me for ID.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:90%
So this was a catch-22.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know what,
it took me a while.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I communicated
to the Center, to Moscow.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I says, I'm having
a problem here.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Can you give me some advice?

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Try to figure it out.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.232 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
that they hired people like me.

00:07:34.232 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they
figured you can figure it out.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: We are
figuring things out.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And one day-- and I
did a lot of research.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.398 align:middle line:84%
You know, you could
go to the library

00:07:42.398 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:90%
and read books and stuff.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:90%
That was not a problem.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%
You just couldn't get a card.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.012 align:middle line:84%
So I did a lot of reading,
I looked at newspapers.

00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to figure out,
how do I get some kind of an ID

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:84%
that allows me to
get a library card?

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was in the
Museum of Natural History,

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and they were
advertising memberships.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And I saw they had
little plastic cards that

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:84%
would have your name
on it and your address.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So I paid like, what, $40
for an annual membership.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I got my little ID, I went to
the public library in Brooklyn.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And when they asked
for ID, I said--

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.582 align:middle line:90%
and they accepted it.

00:08:17.582 --> 00:08:20.370 align:middle line:84%
[WHISTLES] Now I
had my library card,

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:84%
which was a requirement to
get a driver's license for--

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.182 align:middle line:84%
the driver's license
was a piece of cake.

00:08:28.182 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I just had to learn how to
parallel park in New York.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.096 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:33.598 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: And then--

00:08:33.598 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then the next
big one, social security.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That was
a big one simply

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
because I had--
this one, you had

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:90%
to be interviewed in person.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't get it
through the mail, right?

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.420 align:middle line:90%
That was a requirement.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably, outside
of entering the United States,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.103 align:middle line:90%
the second most scary moment.

00:08:53.103 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the
background on it is great.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.030 align:middle line:84%
You really prepped, get
everything-- you know,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.350 align:middle line:90%
god is in the details.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But you didn't believe
in God, per se, right?

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And so when you prepped for
the social security card,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.523 align:middle line:90%
I just said, oh my god.

00:09:06.523 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
You found out there
were two exemptions.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Correct.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
like, hey, you're old.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you have a social
security card, right?

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And in those days,
folks who were employed

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
by religious
organizations, churches,

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
were not subject to the
social security law.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:90%
And farm workers.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.618 align:middle line:84%
So my back story, we had me
on a farm for several years.

00:09:25.618 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you did the work.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.743 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: So I had to
now impersonate, like,

00:09:28.743 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
somebody who had just
jumped off the potato truck.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't shave for
a couple of days.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I went out in the park and
put a little dirt on my face.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.280 align:middle line:90%
I rubbed--

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your nails?

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:90%
You rubbed it under your nails.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.945 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes, on my nails.

00:09:43.945 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I rubbed soap into my
eyes so they'd get red.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So I just, like,
dumbed myself down.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And I practiced
answers to questions.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.002 align:middle line:90%
And I made them all mono--

00:09:56.002 --> 00:09:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Monosyllabic.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.935 align:middle line:90%
I mean it was crazy.

00:09:57.935 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --monosyllabic.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes, no.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.388 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You did a great job.

00:10:00.388 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Very short sentences.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.962 align:middle line:90%
Like, you know, uh.

00:10:04.962 --> 00:10:08.317 align:middle line:84%
And I did a pretty good
job playing a dumb idiot.

00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and they said,
why don't you already have one?

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: I said I--

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't
know I needed it.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --didn't need one.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Didn't need one.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Oh, well.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.465 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That was the
truth as they knew it.

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So, and the interview
was very short.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, fill out
this, and we're done.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Whew.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you got your card.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That was brilliant.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that was brilliant.

00:10:24.978 --> 00:10:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But then comes the big
one, the holy grail.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:90%
The passport.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.787 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, the big one.

00:10:30.787 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:90%
This was the plan, the big plan.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know, in hindsight, I'm
very glad that the plan didn't

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:90%
work out.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I would have been a
very dangerous undercover agent.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.280 align:middle line:84%
The plan was to get
an American passport

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and now be a bona fide American
no matter where you are.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And go back to Europe, let's
say, Switzerland or Austria,

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.430 align:middle line:84%
where the KGB was going to
set me up with a company.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And they had very, very
good experience doing that.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And then funnel a bunch
of funds into the company,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and within a year or two, I
would be a multimillionaire,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
come back to the United
States, repatriate the money,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much get accepted
to many a country club.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.285 align:middle line:84%
This is where I was
supposed to meet the people.

00:11:17.285 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were supposed
to be groomed for that.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.277 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do you say--
first, before we

00:11:21.277 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:84%
go to what happened, why do you
say you would have been a very

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:90%
dangerous undercover agent?

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Because I knew
I had the skills to,

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.567 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge, to mingle
with highly educated people.

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But that was the idea.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And this would have
given me an entrance to just,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:84%
like, be naturally
in an environment

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:84%
where you would meet
people who either were

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.120 align:middle line:84%
decision makers or
at least influencers

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:90%
or close to decision makers.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about I
was supposed to find--

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Zbigniew Brzezinski
was a real target, right?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: He was mentioned
as a target among others.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Conservative think tanks.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who had some influence
on government policy.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
I was supposed to--

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally, I was trained
to do political intelligence.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.192 align:middle line:84%
And I would have been
dangerous in that way.

00:12:11.192 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dangerous too whom?

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Dangerous
to the United States.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not to
yourself or to the KGB.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No, no, no.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.614 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dangerous to the US.

00:12:16.614 --> 00:12:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That is correct.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, I would have
been in a position

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:84%
to actually find
out intelligence,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:90%
possibly at the highest level.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they have other
people positioned there?

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: I don't know.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.953 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because you
wouldn't know of each other.

00:12:31.953 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: I know only one other
person who was trained like me

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and sent to the United States.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And his only task
was to live here.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:90%
He was a sleeper, period.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I was a sleeper,
and I was supposed

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:90%
to gather intelligence.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go back
to the application

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:84%
for the passport, which would
have allowed all of that.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.620 align:middle line:84%
We practiced filling
out the form in Moscow.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:90%
And so I knew exactly--

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.360 align:middle line:84%
they told me to go to the
passport agency in person,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:90%
not to do it in the mail.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.705 align:middle line:90%
That was a bad mistake.

00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.977 align:middle line:90%
And I made a mistake myself.

00:13:11.977 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think it through.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:90%
I followed the instructions.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.969 align:middle line:84%
So there were a couple of
questions that were like--

00:13:18.969 --> 00:13:21.094 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One was about
your high school, something

00:13:21.094 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:90%
about your high school.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.352 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No, no, no, no.

00:13:22.352 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
No, it started out-- on
the questionnaire it says,

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:90%
what is your profession?

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote the
truth-- bike messenger.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I should have written
independent contractor,

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:90%
because that was the truth.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:90%
I was an independent contractor.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Number one.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Number two, and two questions
that were discretionary.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Where are you going, and when
are you planning to go there?

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I left them blank.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.270 align:middle line:90%
So now we have a messenger--

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Messenger boy.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.103 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: --who doesn't
make a lot of money,

00:13:53.103 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't know where he's
going and where he's going.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:84%
What does he need
the passport for?

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:90%
And so that triggered the agent.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:90%
This is what he said--

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
we have some questions
about your identity.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Please fill out a
separate questionnaire

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.360 align:middle line:90%
so we can validate.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:90%
I took that piece of paper.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I went over to the side where
there were some spots where you

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:90%
can write sit down and write.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The very first question
blew up the whole thing

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.310 align:middle line:90%
and I knew this.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even read
anything afterwards.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.072 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go to high school?

00:14:32.072 --> 00:14:33.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They didn't train you.

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:35.363 align:middle line:84%
You didn't get you back
story straightened out.

00:14:35.363 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: My back story had me
go to a high school in New York

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.267 align:middle line:90%
City, but--

00:14:40.267 --> 00:14:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't
give your names.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: I wasn't there.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: I wasn't-- they
could called them up,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.257 align:middle line:84%
did that guy ever
go to, know you--

00:14:48.257 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't answer that question.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So I knew at that point I
had only one way to get out

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:90%
of there in one piece--

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to grab whatever I
could grab so there

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.230 align:middle line:90%
was no trace of me being there.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And he had my application still
sitting there on his desk.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So I just went there
and I pretended

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to be really angry
like, [BUMBLING]..

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Righteous indignation.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Why are you making me jump
through all these hoops?

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:14.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't need this--

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: B.S.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.257 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --fill the blanks.

00:15:16.257 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And I grabbed the stuff
and walked out of there.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your heart must
have been about to explode.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.107 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: I expected
that security

00:15:23.107 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:90%
would come running after me.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they never knew that Jack
Barsky applied for a passport

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and that he probably
has a shady background.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So now you're here,
you're doing your job.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:84%
At what point did you end up
getting a job with MetLife?

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk-- go through
the bicycle messenger

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:84%
phase of your life until
you got a real job.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That was
actually pretty lucky

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.050 align:middle line:90%
that I got into this job.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.177 align:middle line:84%
Because I learned to be an
American by observing people

00:16:04.177 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
who didn't really--
who weren't really

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.740 align:middle line:90%
curious about anybody else.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.873 align:middle line:90%
They were just there, right?

00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They weren't nosy.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.207 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: They weren't nosy.

00:16:12.207 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot
of transients that

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.310 align:middle line:90%
came in and out of that space.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So for two years I was in
a pretty safe environment.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.792 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: If I had mingled
with highly educated people,

00:16:25.792 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:84%
they would have found
out that something is not

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:90%
right about this guy.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:84%
By the time I went to MetLife, I
also had three years of college

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:90%
behind me.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:90%
So now I could manage.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, I could
manage to operate

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
on the false documents
pretending that I

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:90%
was an American from birth.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.685 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- meanwhile,
you're having to go back.

00:16:47.685 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
You're being called back
to the Soviet Union.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes, every two years--

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every two years.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --I went back.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have
Gerlinde, who they allowed you

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.492 align:middle line:90%
to have a relationship with.

00:16:55.492 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes, that's--

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
have a son, Matthias.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:90%
I went back--

00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You left
them behind, yeah.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: I went
back for debriefing.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Additional training a
little bit, as time allowed.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And then spending some
time with my German family

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:90%
every two years.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.339 align:middle line:90%
So that was going on.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you're now
developing an American life.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm developing two
distinct personalities

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:84%
that really didn't interact
with each other very well.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:27.450 align:middle line:84%
The American was-- the moment
I came back to New York,

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I was American again and I
forgot all about Germany.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:90%
And vise-versa.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:84%
You brought a lot
of goods, however,

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:84%
all the nice stuff
back to your girlfriend

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.132 align:middle line:90%
or back to your friends.

00:17:39.132 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That's right.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.772 align:middle line:84%
I bought clothes
at Bergdorf Goodman

00:17:41.772 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and brought them
into East Germany.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:84%
You were digging
the American life.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.682 align:middle line:84%
People looking at
her as though, what?

00:17:48.682 --> 00:17:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Where does she get
that stuff from?

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't even get
this in West Berlin.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, at one point there
was an interesting moment

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:90%
where your mother--

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.672 align:middle line:84%
because you kept
disappearing and you

00:17:57.672 --> 00:18:00.172 align:middle line:84%
weren't really explaining that
well anything to your family.

00:18:00.172 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:90%
You had to lie to them.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:90%
And she said, are you a spy?

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: That was that was
roughly when I joined the KGB

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.810 align:middle line:90%
and when I changed back stories.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:84%
At first I stopped
my academic career

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.442 align:middle line:84%
to become a member of the State
Department of East Germany.

00:18:17.442 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
mom's like, huh.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Something's up.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And then I went back
to research in Kazakhstan,

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:84%
to join the space research
agency of the Soviet Union.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And at that point she
said, are you a spy?

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And then my brother
came to my aid there

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and he said, no, Albrecht
would not do that.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:90%
And so she calmed down.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.258 align:middle line:84%
She literally bought
into the cover stories--

00:18:41.258 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The stories
you were telling her.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So meanwhile you're--

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.105 align:middle line:84%
were you married to
Gerlinde at this time?

00:18:48.105 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: I was, yes.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.186 align:middle line:90%
I was.

00:18:49.186 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your
wife, she was fully

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.360 align:middle line:90%
aware of what you were doing.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: She was absolutely.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.788 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
allowed it because she

00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:55.635 align:middle line:90%
was a good, steady mate.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And they also-- this is
an interesting thing,

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.677 align:middle line:84%
because they normally didn't
want those attachments.

00:18:59.677 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
You write in the book,
the one perk to that

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.800 align:middle line:84%
is because you loved
women, it might keep you

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.390 align:middle line:90%
from getting too close to--

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.952 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That's correct.

00:19:06.952 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --any other women.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.962 align:middle line:90%
Because you were married.

00:19:08.962 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: She and the
son were an anchor

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:84%
that would make me think twice
about possibly defecting.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Because you'd have to
leave them behind forever.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Because there was
an understated stated threat

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:84%
that something bad might
happen to them if I

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.253 align:middle line:90%
betrayed the Soviet Union.

00:19:26.253 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, women
could work their way

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.195 align:middle line:90%
in an intelligence, too.

00:19:29.195 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That's incorrect.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.153 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:31.153 --> 00:19:33.112 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You'd be uncovered.

00:19:33.112 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So you're going back and
forth every two years.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.945 align:middle line:90%
Now you're back here.

00:19:35.945 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:90%
You're working for MetLife.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And now you have another
relationship and another life

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:90%
going on in the United States.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.005 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want to talk
about the psychological part

00:19:45.005 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
of how you began feeling
living on American soil,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
living the American
life, working

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:90%
for an American corporation.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Well, a year
or two into working

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
at MetLife I sort of--
there was a moment

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:90%
when things started flipping.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.160 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
insurance industry

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:84%
was taught to us to be
one of the most evil parts

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:90%
of capitalism.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't see much
evil within MetLife,

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
at least not the
part that I saw.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a very
paternalistic type company.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And I felt it almost
like back home.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:90%
You know, they took care of you.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:90%
They even fed you a free lunch.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:90%
I had a great job.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You made friends.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Great friends.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And they
were good people.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:90%
And I had a great job.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.560 align:middle line:90%
And there came a moment when--

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:84%
you know, as a
programmer, as an IT guy,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:84%
it's quite demanding--
there came a moment when

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.110 align:middle line:84%
my spy stuff was in the
way of or interfering

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:90%
with my other job.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And then-- I don't know
exactly when that happened,

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.658 align:middle line:84%
but I was starting
to think about man,

00:20:58.658 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:84%
one of those days I'm going
to have to leave this place

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:90%
and go back.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.140 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to miss it.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.720 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't enough for me to
say I'm going to stay here,

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:90%
but you know, I became really--

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I adjusted to the
American way of life,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and it sort of took
me over as something

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:90%
that I really enjoyed and liked.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And would have, if I
could have, continued.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I
always was planning

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.787 align:middle line:90%
to go back and reunite--

00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about
the philosophically?

00:21:29.495 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, ideologically.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Was that starting to
break down with it?

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Somewhat.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really buy
into the capitalism

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:90%
is all evil theology anymore.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:84%
I became-- not-knowing that
that theory actually existed,

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:51.125 align:middle line:84%
I became an adherent to what
was called conversion theory.

00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that mean?

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.625 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: A
conversion theory was

00:21:53.625 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:84%
in the 70s something
that came out

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
of the socialist
parties in Europe.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.588 align:middle line:84%
The idea was that capitalism
and socialism will eventually

00:22:02.588 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:84%
converge into a
socialistic kind of--

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Democratic socialism.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Something like that.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.276 align:middle line:90%
And that sounded pretty good.

00:22:09.276 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, there were
some folks within the KGB

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.772 align:middle line:90%
who were--

00:22:14.772 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In support of that.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: In support of that.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:17.823 align:middle line:90%
Correctly.

00:22:17.823 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this was already
happening in your own mind.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now you have
also developed a relationship

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:27.725 align:middle line:90%
with a woman over here.

00:22:27.725 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Who you had children with.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Penelope.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
She was an illegal
alien when I met her.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
She was very safe
to have to have

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
an intimate relationship
with because she

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:90%
came from another country.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.170 align:middle line:84%
She wouldn't have known whether
I was a true American or not.

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.010 align:middle line:90%
She was very pretty.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And one day she confided in
me that she was in the country

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.530 align:middle line:84%
illegally and she was looking
for somebody to get married to.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're in your
own precarious situation.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: So there is my
damsel in distress syndrome

00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.875 align:middle line:90%
that popped up.

00:22:59.875 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:90%
Let me think about this.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And I did some investigation,
and I figured yeah,

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:90%
I can pull this off.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So I applied for her and
she became a citizen.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
The interview was
real easy because she

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:90%
managed to get pregnant.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we have a
second family brewing here.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: I got married.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:90%
Here's a child coming.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And this childbirth
is still my child.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:90%
She is here.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.477 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Chelsea.

00:23:26.477 --> 00:23:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful woman.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And she
changed my life.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so everything
was in sublime order.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:84%
However, the relationship
started deteriorating.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:90%
But now let me ask you this.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.758 align:middle line:84%
Now, people are wondering,
what did you do as a spy?

00:23:37.758 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like you had a
pretty chilled life working

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:90%
for MetLife.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:90%
What did you actually do?

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you have dead drops
that you were working with?

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Were you trying to
get intelligence

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.170 align:middle line:90%
on a corporate level back?

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Or what?

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Well, this was really
odd in that you, know since,

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:90%
plan A didn't work, now--

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're aren't
to go to the high way

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.375 align:middle line:90%
without the passport.

00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Plan B
was, like, you know,

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.620 align:middle line:84%
slowly work your
way up in society.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't positioned to get to
know the people that they would

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:90%
have wanted me to get to know.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the
targets was the Institute

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
for Foreign Relations
at Columbia University,

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
where Brzezinski actually
operated at the time.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.500 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't have
a good way of--

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't
have the connections.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --winding up there.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Because I had a day job here.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And what is my reason
for being there?

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So I expressed that to them,
and they sort of bought it

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:84%
but kept on telling
me, make more contacts.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So while I was a
student, I learned,

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I got to know a lot
of potential recruits.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Fellow students who pursued
one ideology or another.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.050 align:middle line:90%
We liked ideological recruits.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:90%
And so I profiled a few of them.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And what happened with them,
whether they were recruited

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.362 align:middle line:90%
or not I don't know.

00:25:06.362 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
opened the door.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:84%
There were situations
where they actually

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:84%
used my ability to travel
around the country freely.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
At one point I
believe they actually

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:84%
wanted me to find a dead
drop somewhere way up

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.960 align:middle line:84%
north in the northern
part of New England.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think it had something to
do with potentially retrieving

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:90%
stuff that Aldrich Ames--

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:84%
That big, huge spy
scandal in the US.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --may have put there.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Because Ames had direct
contact with KGB,

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:84%
which is really,
really dangerous.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:84%
If they had put
me in the middle,

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:90%
it would have been much safer.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Never happened.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.130 align:middle line:84%
But also they just
really didn't quite

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:84%
know what value
I could have had.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.110 align:middle line:90%
If they had listened to--

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
if they had understood
the value of data.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I had access to
the health records

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.535 align:middle line:90%
of about 50 million Americans.

00:26:03.535 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
were executives

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:84%
of companies that,
you know, were

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.240 align:middle line:84%
in the military
industrial complex.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:90%
I told them.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.412 align:middle line:90%
Didn't get--

00:26:12.412 --> 00:26:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't have
any curiosity toward that.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Didn't register.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't see
how it would be useful.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy to report that
I never personally handled

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:90%
classified materials.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The spy who
didn't get that far.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Thank you.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So meanwhile,
you have this other family.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And you have your Chelsea, who
just split your heart open.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now
you're starting--

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
a day came finally
when you got--

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I remember the book
starts that way.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a little red
dot that they left for you

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:90%
in public transit area.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:90%
And it means come home.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That's right.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've been
bust-- you've been blown.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You get your passport,
get out of the country,

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:54.510 align:middle line:90%
get home.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.100 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Just make a beeline
to the Canadian border.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I had some reserve documents
for a case like that.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
They were hidden
someplace in a park.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Central Park?

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.080 align:middle line:90%
In a park in the Bronx.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.038 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the Bronx.

00:27:09.038 --> 00:27:09.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And you know,
just don't even go home.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Get your stuff now.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Go.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:15.760 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Red alert.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.368 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: And I didn't.

00:27:17.368 --> 00:27:19.180 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't ready.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.620 align:middle line:90%
So I went to work, instead.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.330 align:middle line:90%
This was on my way to work.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, that day I
didn't do much work.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I was just sitting,
staring on the screen.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I had tried to
figure out how to support

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Chelsea, who was at
the time 18 months old.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was the first
time after Rosie

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.110 align:middle line:90%
that I really loved somebody.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.170 align:middle line:90%
But it was a different love.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.100 align:middle line:90%
It was unconditional.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unconditional.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:40.623 align:middle line:90%
With all your heart.

00:27:40.623 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: All she gave
me back was a smile.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And just-- and at that point,
I had not found a solution.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid of
telling the KGB that I

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:84%
had a child, because
they would have,

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:84%
could have helped
support this child.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:90%
No good.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.400 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't ready
to defect, either.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:03.490 align:middle line:90%
So now I'm playing for time.

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:04.660 align:middle line:90%
I could have been sick.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:90%
I could have--

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:90%
I just ignored that signal.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And someone finally
approached you and said,

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:90%
you need to come back.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:84%
After about three weeks
of me playing dead,

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.160 align:middle line:84%
they eventually
went to a drastic--

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.080 align:middle line:84%
took a drastic measure
and have somebody

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.752 align:middle line:84%
approach me directly
on a subway platform.

00:28:22.752 --> 00:28:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Where they knew I
would show up every day

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.630 align:middle line:90%
when I'm going to work.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:90%
And he came--

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I still remember like
it was yesterday.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:34.190 align:middle line:84%
He sidled up to me from
the right, a short guy

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:84%
in a dark coat, and he
whispered, you gotta come back,

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:90%
or else you're dead.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.590 align:middle line:90%
And then he walked away.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, they knew that I
knew that they know.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So everybody knew that
I had the message.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So from now, they
had forced my hand.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:90%
I had to do something.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Either go or find a way to stay.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:01.605 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I came up with
the most brilliant, probably--

00:29:01.605 --> 00:29:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unbelievably
brilliant.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Celestially
inspired lie.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You just love it.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: And I told them--

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.400 align:middle line:84%
I resigned from the KGB with
a letter in secret writing

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:84%
stating that I had
contracted AIDS

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't,
couldn't come back.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:90%
I would be infecting others.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And I may have a chance to get
treated in the United States.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.188 align:middle line:90%
And they bought it.

00:29:24.188 --> 00:29:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they were
terrified of AIDS being--

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Of course, they were.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --introduced
to their country.

00:29:28.065 --> 00:29:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was so genius.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.510 align:middle line:90%
I just laughed when I read that.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my god,
what a genius move.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:84%
You said they were
afraid of three things.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah, I did.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
what tell they were.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: They were standouts.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:10%
They were afraid of AIDS.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid, deathly
afraid of Ronald Reagan.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we all knew that
this man was not quite sane,

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.570 align:middle line:84%
and he had his hand
on the nuclear button.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, and
this is a historic strain

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:90%
in the Russian character--

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Jews.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.700 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me to stay
away from the Jews.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.500 align:middle line:90%
In New York.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In New York.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: How do you do that?

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.232 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
not going to happen.

00:30:10.232 --> 00:30:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So this-- so they had their
fears, their deeply embedded

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.300 align:middle line:90%
fears.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.217 align:middle line:84%
You just hit the one
that you could that would

00:30:15.217 --> 00:30:17.200 align:middle line:90%
work fast and expeditiously.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.130 align:middle line:90%
And so they let--

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.810 align:middle line:84%
they kind of cut you
loose, let you go.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, Gerlinde was
told you were dead, right?

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:24.340 align:middle line:90%
They told her--

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And she was paid off.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Because you hadn't
been collecting

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.570 align:middle line:84%
any of the money
from the KGB, right?

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.528 align:middle line:90%
You had been saving it.

00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: No,
there were-- it was

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:90%
a significant amount of money.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.760 align:middle line:90%
I forgot how much.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.040 align:middle line:90%
$50,000 or $60,000.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think in the
book it said $65,000.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Something like that.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
they paid me a salary

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.660 align:middle line:84%
in dollars while
I was on my own.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.820 align:middle line:90%
I didn't need the money.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because you had a job.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: It added up.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:90%
They also paid my rent.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:90%
So that, I didn't need.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:90%
It added up.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.010 align:middle line:90%
So, you know.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:55.945 align:middle line:84%
And I got a $10,000 award that
went with the second highest

00:30:55.945 --> 00:30:57.570 align:middle line:84%
decoration of the
Soviet Union, which I

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.580 align:middle line:90%
got one year before I retired.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:01.407 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:31:01.407 --> 00:31:02.740 align:middle line:90%
They gave her some of the money.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.360 align:middle line:90%
I never found out how much.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But she received a
significant amount of money.

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.130 align:middle line:90%
And she was told that--

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were dead.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --I died.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Died from AIDS.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
all tidied up.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.180 align:middle line:84%
You guys weren't getting along
well at that time, anyway.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:84%
You didn't see each other
enough to even bond,

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.560 align:middle line:90%
really, in those later years.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: The last
visit was pretty bad.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:90%
She exploded in my face.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And she still loved me, but
she says, you got to stop this.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.533 align:middle line:90%
You know, you gotta come back.

00:31:30.533 --> 00:31:31.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm over
here by myself.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:84%
She spent all the time
alone with Matthias.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: With Matthias.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.930 align:middle line:90%
And this was not beyond repair.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:43.500 align:middle line:90%
But we hadn't grown together.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:90%
We had grown apart.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you spent
all your time apart except

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:90%
for a little visit--

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: 10 years of no.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --every two years.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And, you
know-- and spending--

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 10 years.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Those years were
spent in places that were not

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.150 align:middle line:90%
accessible to ordinary Germans.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can bring so many
pearls and pretty things,

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.010 align:middle line:90%
but that's not going to do it.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:00.202 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No.

00:32:00.202 --> 00:32:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And we had people
that catered to us.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.797 align:middle line:90%
Cooks and cleaning personnel.

00:32:03.797 --> 00:32:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But that's not enough.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.340 align:middle line:84%
She had no
relationship with you.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Nope.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that was done.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And now you go on and you
continue, and you think,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.827 align:middle line:90%
I'm home free.

00:32:13.827 --> 00:32:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Home free.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Home free.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Little did you know there
was another person who was--

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.470 align:middle line:84%
was he a Soviet living
here who was going

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:26.670 align:middle line:90%
through some archival stuff?

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.870 align:middle line:84%
There was an archivist
at KGB headquarters--

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:32.347 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: KGB headquarters, OK.

00:32:32.347 --> 00:32:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: --who had become
disillusioned with the Soviet

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Union and had a deep,
deep, deep hatred

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
in himself for the
system because his son

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:46.345 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of a disease that
could not be treated in Russia.

00:32:46.345 --> 00:32:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
wouldn't let him go.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: He applied to
let him go to England,

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.490 align:middle line:90%
and it was denied.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And so his only way of getting
back at them with revenge

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.640 align:middle line:90%
was to--

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Blow the cover
of people like you.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: --to copy tons and
tons of material over time

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and collect it and
eventually show up

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:84%
at the doors of the
British embassy.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.592 align:middle line:84%
And connect with MI6, the
British espionage agency.

00:33:16.592 --> 00:33:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And they smuggled him
out of the country.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And according to reports, he
had like several cases of paper

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.600 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It was the biggest intelligence
find in all of history.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.218 align:middle line:90%
And I was part of it.

00:33:30.218 --> 00:33:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you were.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.762 align:middle line:90%
Jack Barsky is embedded there.

00:33:32.762 --> 00:33:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That's right.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you come
on the radar of the FBI.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now this is
kind of like "The Americans."

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:43.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, members of your
team move in next to you.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: They did.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
they're spying.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Your house is
bugged, you're being

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.495 align:middle line:90%
watched through binoculars.

00:33:47.495 --> 00:33:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're
bugged to the hilt.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You haven't a clue.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.900 align:middle line:84%
You're a spy who hasn't
a clue that you're

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.300 align:middle line:84%
being totally bugged because
you thought you were home free.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Because I had
long since given up checking

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:57.290 align:middle line:90%
on myself.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.710 align:middle line:90%
I had long since--

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:84%
had stopped putting
markers in my house

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:84%
to see whether somebody
had looked at my stuff.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.210 align:middle line:90%
I was home free.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.043 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Home free.

00:34:07.043 --> 00:34:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Had a new family, had a good
job, you were an American.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So this spying on you went on
for quite a while, I assume.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.395 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: For two-plus years.

00:34:15.395 --> 00:34:17.520 align:middle line:84%
They were very, very careful
because the only thing

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that they really know about me,
that I was an embedded sleeper.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.080 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea whether
I was still active.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And if I had still been active,
I would have found out--

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.940 align:middle line:84%
if they weren't really careful,
I would have found out.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So they just wanted to
find out, what is he doing

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.150 align:middle line:90%
or what is he not doing?

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And after two
years, I eventually

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.909 align:middle line:90%
provided them with a confession.

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:40.409 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wrapped
it up in a bow

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.183 align:middle line:84%
because you were
confessing to your wife.

00:34:42.183 --> 00:34:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Because she's like that, eh.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: The house was
bugged, and I told her--

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.413 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The whole story.

00:34:46.413 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --the whole story.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.343 align:middle line:90%
And they had it on tape.

00:34:50.343 --> 00:34:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was wrapped
up in a bow for them.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.969 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, yeah, got you.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:54.769 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:34:54.769 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then the sting
where you're apprehended.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.405 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Yeah,
I was apprehended

00:34:58.405 --> 00:35:02.190 align:middle line:84%
where they simulated
a routine traffic stop

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.560 align:middle line:90%
as I'm crossing the Delaware.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
this tall bridge.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm getting through,
I'm being waved to the side

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.370 align:middle line:90%
by a state trooper.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.580 align:middle line:84%
They invented a state
trooper, actually.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:90%
The guy wasn't FBI.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:24.360 align:middle line:84%
They just asked the state police
if they could use somebody.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, well, this
is a routine traffic stop.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Could you please step
out of the vehicle?

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Which was already
a little bit odd.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I see from
my peripheral vision

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.690 align:middle line:90%
from the right--

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:90%
again, from the right--

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.840 align:middle line:90%
somebody is coming up.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And before I could even think
what's going on, the fellow

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:49.397 align:middle line:84%
comes close and he flips open
something like a wallet or a --

00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have to look at it.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have to
hear what he said.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You knew.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.408 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: He said, the FBI
would like to talk to you.

00:35:55.408 --> 00:35:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I already knew something not
very good was going to happen.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Joe Riley, who was

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.385 align:middle line:84%
the agent who approached
me, who is now

00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:07.068 align:middle line:90%
a good friend of mine and the--

00:36:07.068 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
beautiful part of the story.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: --godfather
of my last child.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.245 align:middle line:84%
According to Joe, I
went white as a sheet.

00:36:16.245 --> 00:36:17.890 align:middle line:84%
[WHISTLES] All
blood disappeared.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:18.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No kidding.

00:36:18.765 --> 00:36:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Your life's over.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:22.017 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden, it's like--

00:36:22.017 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
going to be in prison.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Like a dam broke,
the waters of my past

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:34.530 align:middle line:84%
came rushing in and
pretty much devoured me.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.620 align:middle line:90%
And then things sort of eased.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.150 align:middle line:84%
The waters became
still and quiet.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the first question I
asked them, am I under arrest?

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.110 align:middle line:84%
When they told me to
get in the car and we

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.000 align:middle line:90%
were driving someplace north.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And they said, no.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Just a little speck of
light there on the horizon.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And then Joe turns around--
he was in the passenger

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.340 align:middle line:90%
seat-- he turns around.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Hey Jack, this may not be
the worst day of your life.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's a glimmer of hope.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we spent a couple
of hours of them interrogating

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:13.110 align:middle line:90%
me, and then they let me go.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Let me go back home.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Not without a warning.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.290 align:middle line:90%
They had a big team.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.970 align:middle line:90%
It was a massive event there.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:25.480 align:middle line:84%
They had people at every
intersection surrounding

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.280 align:middle line:90%
my house.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was told, listen,
if you think of running--

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, this was
like in the movies.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.130 align:middle line:90%
We we'll catch you.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were surrounded.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I had no reason to run, but
they didn't know that yet.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why did
he let you go home?

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Because
they were interested

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:90%
in my full cooperation.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they were treating
me with civility.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.260 align:middle line:90%
It was always very polite.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No water-boarding.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Very respectful.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I did have to pass
a lie detector test.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was all
very collaborative.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And by this time,
you're really an American,

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.830 align:middle line:90%
more or less.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: I had no reason to
protect anything or anybody.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.980 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I didn't
know enough details

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:08.520 align:middle line:90%
to give anybody else up.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Which--

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were operating
on your own and an American,

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.140 align:middle line:90%
so you didn't have a lot.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: And with regard to--

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.340 align:middle line:84%
you know, I had no allegiance
to the Soviet Union.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, I
had learned enough

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:23.840 align:middle line:84%
about what an evil state
East Germany had been,

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.290 align:middle line:84%
so I had no allegiance
to that entity anymore.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:31.310 align:middle line:90%
So I was gladly cooperating.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean, I
love this part of the story.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Because to be an FBI
agent and undercover

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.210 align:middle line:84%
took some of the same
kind of personality traits

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.010 align:middle line:90%
that you had.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.250 align:middle line:84%
You could understand
each other in a way.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Almost as, in a way,
a kind of brotherhood

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.220 align:middle line:84%
of people who have lived this
kind of isolated and dangerous

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.020 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.580 align:middle line:90%
And you understood each other.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: FBI understands
people like me theoretically.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.930 align:middle line:84%
CIA understands people
like me instinctively.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And I've met
some ex-CIA people,

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.688 align:middle line:84%
and we can finish each
other's sentences.

00:39:05.688 --> 00:39:07.688 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
that's the same mindset.

00:39:07.688 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Same mindset.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was enough
that he saw the humanity in you.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he writes this
beautiful thing about you

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.080 align:middle line:90%
at the end of your book.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.122 align:middle line:84%
That's why I encourage
everyone to read the book.

00:39:17.122 --> 00:39:18.680 align:middle line:84%
To me, it really,
it made me cry.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.930 align:middle line:84%
It did make me cry a
few times in the book.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.597 align:middle line:84%
And he became a good
friend, as you say.

00:39:22.597 --> 00:39:23.397 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:39:23.397 --> 00:39:24.680 align:middle line:90%
We've played a lot of golf.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:24.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You play golf still.

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beautiful
end to that story.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the worst
day of your life.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Nope.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It might have
been one of the best.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad they caught me.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:39.040 align:middle line:84%
My life made yet another turn,
and it was for the better.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:90%
It became very interesting.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we're
going to take--

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.350 align:middle line:90%
we're going to swap out Chelsea.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:49.160 align:middle line:84%
We'll have her sit in your
chair for a few minutes.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Because she was 19
when she found out

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.472 align:middle line:84%
her wonderful American
daddy was a Soviet spy.

00:39:57.472 --> 00:39:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to come back to you.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk to you
about some modern day events.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: OK.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
the psyche of Russia.

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And the mindsets that we're
all dealing with right now.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Because everyone is so confused.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And that ideology you
talked about at the top

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:90%
of the last show.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.480 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, Jack.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: OK.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.570 align:middle line:90%
We'll see Chelsea now.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Welcome Chelsea.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.210 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely beautiful.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHELSEA DITTRICH: Thank you.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you dad told us
all those are your real eyes.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.317 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yes.

00:40:23.317 --> 00:40:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You haven't
had an eye transplant.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Those big, beautiful eyes.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's just get right down to
it, because we have so much

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:90%
to do in so little time.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So when your dad was
busted and he was taken in,

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.320 align:middle line:84%
then he was able
to share with you,

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:90%
reveal his true identity to you.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.890 align:middle line:90%
You were 19 years old.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:45.120 align:middle line:84%
You're a very smart woman, and
you were a smart young woman

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.810 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:49.072 align:middle line:84%
What were your
reactions, first of all,

00:40:49.072 --> 00:40:51.280 align:middle line:84%
to know that your dad had
a totally separate life you

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.250 align:middle line:90%
hadn't known about?

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Mostly curiosity.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:58.350 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't say that I was angry.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:10%
I've never felt anger
over any of this.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.097 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly, OK, now things
are starting to make sense.

00:41:04.097 --> 00:41:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was making sense?

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:09.330 align:middle line:84%
What was out of place before
that this cleared up for you?

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DITTRICH: The house we
lived in Pennsylvania.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:14.310 align:middle line:90%
It was rural Pennsylvania.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And upper Mount Bethel, it
was just a very rural town.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Our house was nestled
on four acres,

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and we had neighbors that
were like a quarter mile away.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Every house was like a quarter
mile away, half a mile away.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But our neighbors
right next door.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I never saw clothes
on the clothesline.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:90%
The grass was always cut.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.348 align:middle line:90%
The curtains were always shut.

00:41:34.348 --> 00:41:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anyone go
in and out of the house

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.760 align:middle line:90%
except for one time.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I just always had this
strange feeling about things.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And some things
just didn't add up.

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Asking my dad about his past,
he didn't really have a story.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:51.030 align:middle line:84%
As holding up pictures
of your family,

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:52.933 align:middle line:84%
I had no pictures
of my grandparents.

00:41:52.933 --> 00:41:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have
the right information

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.870 align:middle line:84%
because he gave me
a different story.

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:59.460 align:middle line:90%
It was a cover story.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.988 align:middle line:84%
And things just
didn't make sense,

00:42:01.988 --> 00:42:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have
enough information.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:06.695 align:middle line:90%
And for me information is power.

00:42:06.695 --> 00:42:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and you were also

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:09.278 align:middle line:90%
kind of a devotee of history.

00:42:09.278 --> 00:42:11.700 align:middle line:84%
You loved watching shows
on the History Channel

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:13.340 align:middle line:90%
and reading books about history.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And you were
interested in Germany,

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:17.410 align:middle line:84%
in World War II,
and all of this.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And so your life,
little did you know,

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.410 align:middle line:84%
had a direct connection
to all of that.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And so there are a couple
of different things.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But one is, because
you had that interest

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and now you realize
your dad is German.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Albrecht Dittrich.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.872 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, you changed your
last name to Dittrich, right?

00:42:36.872 --> 00:42:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yes, I did.

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
now Chelsea Dittrich.

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DITTRICH: Yeah, there
was a reason for that.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I had a documentary out
on A&E that aired in 2018.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And just before that,
I realized that when

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I learned about the family
of the original Jack Barsky,

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.740 align:middle line:84%
they already knew
about all of this,

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.670 align:middle line:84%
it kind of hit my
heartstrings a little bit.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that if
I would go public

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:04.320 align:middle line:84%
with my part of
the story that it

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.920 align:middle line:90%
might bring up some old wounds.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wouldn't
carry that name.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.972 align:middle line:84%
>>DITTRICH: And I didn't
want to carry that name.

00:43:08.972 --> 00:43:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Really and truly,
if everything was

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.830 align:middle line:84%
under the right circumstances,
I would have had that last name.

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So out of respect
for the family,

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and the real Jack
Barsky, that's why I

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.890 align:middle line:90%
wanted to change my last name.

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was very
sensitive of you to do.

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:22.780 align:middle line:90%
And so now back to the house.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.685 align:middle line:90%
So now you know.

00:43:23.685 --> 00:43:25.310 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to
answer some questions.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the house that had
no laundry and so forth,

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.440 align:middle line:84%
was that where Joe
Riley was living?

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yeah.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.790 align:middle line:84%
That was the house that
they planted two FBI agents.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I've seen that.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.408 align:middle line:90%
And so it's like, hmm, OK.

00:43:35.408 --> 00:43:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: That's crazy.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:39.088 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they went through
our trash every Wednesday

00:43:39.088 --> 00:43:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and they returned it before
the garbage man came.

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had
cameras everywhere.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DITTRICH: These are
things that were--

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:44.100 align:middle line:90%
cameras all over the house.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.720 align:middle line:90%
Microphones all over the house.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:51.510 align:middle line:84%
These are things that you
don't realize the FBI does.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And I learned about
this happening

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:90%
when I was in my early 20s.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.350 align:middle line:90%
So my dad told me when I was 19.

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But a few years later was
when I found out about the FBI

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.560 align:middle line:90%
buying the house next door.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.290 align:middle line:90%
Big story.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yeah, the whole--

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:05.960 align:middle line:90%
all the details.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, this
is unbelievable.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:09.410 align:middle line:90%
You're--

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
out of a movie.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yes.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But you know, my
world view on privacy

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.130 align:middle line:90%
is completely different.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Like, I don't expect
privacy in my life.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, not anymore.

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, your mother didn't handle
the news as well as you did.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.176 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: No.

00:44:21.176 --> 00:44:22.660 align:middle line:90%
No, she did not.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.452 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was
kind of the end of--

00:44:24.452 --> 00:44:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DITTRICH: but my mother also
found out long before I knew.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And she had to keep her mind and
her mouth shut for a long time.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Because they weren't
able to be open

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:90%
and to be able to talk about it.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So no, she didn't
handle it very well.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And as a matter of

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fact-- Because
it's destabilized her future.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Mm-hmm.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's caused a lot of tension
between me and her having

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:49.720 align:middle line:90%
a mother-daughter relationship.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
we're working on now.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, she definitely
did not handle that well.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:56.127 align:middle line:90%
And they're apart now.

00:44:56.127 --> 00:44:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And he's been
remarried since then.

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And your family continues
to grow, your step siblings

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.440 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Now really-- so
let's just go back.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, you'd studied
this era of history.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Now you find out your dad is
part of that era of history.

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:11.470 align:middle line:90%
How did--

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you're a person
of curiosity and intrigue

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and want to know, how did
that affect your relationship

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.950 align:middle line:84%
with your dad on a
bonding level, even?

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DITTRICH: I think
we became closer.

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I think you become
closer in general

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:30.110 align:middle line:84%
with anyone when they reveal
their true selves to you.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And even though it
took my dad two decades

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.120 align:middle line:84%
of my life to get
to that point, I

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.180 align:middle line:84%
think it became a thing that
drew us closer because I

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.860 align:middle line:90%
understood him better.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I understood his
reasons, his why.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I understood how lucky I was,
how fortunate and blessed I

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.402 align:middle line:84%
am that everything turned
out the way it did.

00:45:49.402 --> 00:45:50.985 align:middle line:84%
Because it could
have been much worse.

00:45:50.985 --> 00:45:52.652 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It could
have been much worse.

00:45:52.652 --> 00:45:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is you the reason
your dad made this move,

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.795 align:middle line:90%
anyway, for the most part.

00:45:56.795 --> 00:45:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really were
central to the whole story.

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Because of his
unconditional love for you,

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:03.230 align:middle line:90%
which he had never experienced.

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yeah.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And I feel very honored that
he credits me with that,

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.202 align:middle line:84%
because I was so young I
wouldn't understand that.

00:46:09.202 --> 00:46:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you
wouldn't understand it.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Now, a big thing happened.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:18.120 align:middle line:84%
You insisted that your father
bring Matthias, your older

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.590 align:middle line:84%
brother from Germany, from
the marriage of Gerlinde,

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.040 align:middle line:84%
back into his life
and your life.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yeah.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.040 align:middle line:90%
So rewind.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So we were-- my parents
were starting to go

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.350 align:middle line:90%
through the divorce process.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And my dad moved out
to be closer to work.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.283 align:middle line:90%
I visited him.

00:46:35.283 --> 00:46:37.200 align:middle line:84%
We're watching a basketball
game on the couch.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.903 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I played basketball
in college, that was our thing.

00:46:39.903 --> 00:46:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and your
dad are both very tall.

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yes.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So we're watching
a basketball game,

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.875 align:middle line:84%
and my dad doesn't even
look me in the eye.

00:46:46.875 --> 00:46:48.740 align:middle line:84%
He's Looking at the
TV, and he says,

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.010 align:middle line:84%
did I tell you that you
have another brother?

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:53.320 align:middle line:90%
I was just like, what?

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:90%
That's unbelievable.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.870 align:middle line:90%
And I was confused.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought he was talking
about my younger brother.

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But he quickly told
me, no, no, no.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.530 align:middle line:84%
You have an older
brother in Germany.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:03.950 align:middle line:90%
His name is Matthias.

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And I just asked him
for more information.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Like where was he born?

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:07.463 align:middle line:90%
What's his birthday?

00:47:07.463 --> 00:47:09.180 align:middle line:90%
What does he look like?

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.470 align:middle line:90%
What's his mom's name?

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know because
my initial intent was,

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to find him.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted nothing
to do with that.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.000 align:middle line:84%
He wanted absolutely
nothing to do with that.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But your
dad knows you're going

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.100 align:middle line:90%
to do what you want to do.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Absolutely.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.565 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing that
since I was young.

00:47:22.565 --> 00:47:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You was born.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yeah.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So he knew that I would
definitely go after him

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and try to find him.

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.080 align:middle line:84%
He didn't think I was
going to be successful.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.300 align:middle line:84%
It took me a year and a
half, but I found him.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And?

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DITTRICH: And I sent my
dad a quick little email note

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:38.950 align:middle line:90%
saying, hey, guess what?

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I found Matthias, here's a
link to his CV on the Free

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.920 align:middle line:84%
University of Berlin's
website, and there's a picture,

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.445 align:middle line:90%
and that's definitely him.

00:47:47.445 --> 00:47:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in
contact with him

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to come
to the US to meet me.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And the answer that I got
from my dad was, now what?

00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:59.050 align:middle line:90%
I think he was terrified.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sure he was.

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And Matthias wasn't all that
hot on meeting your dad.

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to meet you.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yeah.

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:06.580 align:middle line:84%
He just wanted to
come to the US.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And he was very adamant,
stating that you know,

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.077 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to worry
about meeting him.

00:48:10.077 --> 00:48:11.200 align:middle line:90%
I just want to meet you.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.200 align:middle line:90%
I have very little time.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm finishing up my PhD.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.002 align:middle line:84%
I just want to meet
you, you're my sister.

00:48:17.002 --> 00:48:18.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was
a surprise to him.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.750 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know he had a sister.

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:21.970 align:middle line:90%
He had no idea.

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So ultimately,
it was chilly.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.430 align:middle line:90%
A little frosty to begin with.

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yes.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your dad did
come into the picture.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Yes.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.640 align:middle line:90%
So Matthias came to visit.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.510 align:middle line:84%
It was the second
morning that I woke up,

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and Matthias was
staring at me sleeping.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't, like,
bothered by that.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:39.580 align:middle line:90%
I knew.

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I felt the same way.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I was just like, can't
believe this guy is here.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:44.380 align:middle line:90%
This is my brother.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But he said-- when I woke up,
he said, I want to meet him.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:50.370 align:middle line:90%
But you have to be there.

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.220 align:middle line:90%
And I said, are you sure?

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.010 align:middle line:90%
So I called him, tell my dad.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And I say, hey, can you meet us
for dinner at the Clinton House

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.420 align:middle line:90%
maybe tonight or tomorrow night?

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:01.907 align:middle line:90%
And he hung up the phone on me.

00:49:01.907 --> 00:49:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And he calls me back
10 minutes later,

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and he says 8PM at
the Clinton House.

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And then Matthias and I were
quiet for the rest of the day

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.530 align:middle line:90%
because we were nervous.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And though it wasn't,
you know, warm and huggy

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and everything,
ultimately the two men

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.260 align:middle line:84%
found their way back together
over a period of time.

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And now there are
four children, right?

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Mm-hmm.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All told.

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And as a family, you've
come to support your father.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Your father supports you.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Gerlinde wasn't particularly
happy to know that he was alive

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:34.120 align:middle line:90%
and not dead.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that was kind of not
a pleasant surprise for her.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: No.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.287 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for everyone there
are surprises in this story.

00:49:40.287 --> 00:49:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There was, yeah.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: So, I mean--

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just kept
getting more interesting.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Absolutely, yes.

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so because we
have to bring your dad back on

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and talk to him about
some more things.

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking god, we
need yet another hour.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me, to
you, what this has

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:58.570 align:middle line:84%
done in terms of influencing
and strengthening your life.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DITTRICH: I'm a lot
more open in my life.

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And my curiosity has always
played a part in general,

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:12.620 align:middle line:84%
but it's, I seek to understand
before anything else.

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So this has actually
opened up, you know,

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.660 align:middle line:84%
more into my relationships
with my family.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Even though, you
know, we've come

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:21.483 align:middle line:84%
to an understanding
in the family,

00:50:21.483 --> 00:50:23.150 align:middle line:84%
there's still this
elephant in the room.

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.860 align:middle line:84%
There's still some
things that we're

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.150 align:middle line:84%
going to sweep under the
rug and not talk about.

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:28.027 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:50:28.027 --> 00:50:28.860 align:middle line:90%
And we all get that.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.300 align:middle line:90%
But we're all here now.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.140 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very happy about that.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.525 align:middle line:84%
There are things like
pictures of my grandparents

00:50:35.525 --> 00:50:39.500 align:middle line:84%
that I never would have had if
I wasn't able to find Matthias.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.810 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that,
there's another brother

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:43.640 align:middle line:90%
that I found out about later.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.570 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, my
dad helped me find him.

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:49.200 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just me.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot
more to this story.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But what this has
done from my life

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:58.152 align:middle line:84%
and for the family is just
we now all have each other.

00:50:58.152 --> 00:50:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is beautiful.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And it really is down
to you because you

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.150 align:middle line:84%
had a very curious mind and
a very courageous heart.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And those are ultimately
things that your dad developed

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.935 align:middle line:90%
in himself over time, too.

00:51:09.935 --> 00:51:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DITTRICH: Yeah, there's
a big change in everyone.

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.435 align:middle line:84%
There's a great
change in my dad.

00:51:13.435 --> 00:51:16.550 align:middle line:84%
There's this-- my dad
carried around a lot of guilt

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.280 align:middle line:90%
for the majority of his life.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.320 align:middle line:90%
A lot of repressed emotions.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have watched him
transform into what he is now.

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And now he's actually able to be
honest and open and a lot more

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.930 align:middle line:84%
free, which has also affected
everybody else in the family.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.840 align:middle line:84%
The rest of us can
do the same thing.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's a really big blessing.

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:39.692 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it is a love story.

00:51:39.692 --> 00:51:41.900 align:middle line:84%
He said that on the phone
with me a couple weeks ago.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.520 align:middle line:84%
He said, this is
really a love story.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Is is.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you're
the product of that.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.800 align:middle line:90%
And you're just a shining light.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so happy you
were able to have

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.680 align:middle line:84%
both the curiosity and the
will to put your family back

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.480 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Thank you.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
so much, Chelsea.

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Thank you.

00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now we're going to
go back and talk with your dad

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.050 align:middle line:90%
about current events of the day.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.135 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all
confused here in America

00:52:02.135 --> 00:52:04.847 align:middle line:84%
and don't understand
what's going on here.

00:52:04.847 --> 00:52:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And we don't understand
what's going on in Russia.

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:09.327 align:middle line:84%
And we don't understand the
relationship between the two.

00:52:09.327 --> 00:52:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
go back to your dad.

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again, Chelsea.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DITTRICH: Thank you, Regina.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:18.760 align:middle line:84%
We're back with Jack,
or Dieter, or Albrecht.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Whatever.

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Or William Dyson.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: William Dyson.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:23.710 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Your daughter's just so
articulate and beautiful.

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: I'm proud of her.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was wonderful.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:27.945 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you should be.

00:52:27.945 --> 00:52:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I
wanted to talk about but not

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:32.440 align:middle line:84%
take a lot of time on
is "The Americans."

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of America was
intrigued with this show.

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And I first heard about it
on PBS with the producers.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.930 align:middle line:84%
How much of that
show about these two

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:45.270 align:middle line:84%
embedded Russian spies had truth
in it versus was pure fiction

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:46.420 align:middle line:90%
and entertainment?

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:47.253 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: All right.

00:52:47.253 --> 00:52:48.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with the truth.

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:54.060 align:middle line:84%
What the producers of
that show do very well

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and what they got
right is the psychology

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.980 align:middle line:90%
of living a double life.

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.018 align:middle line:90%
The stress that comes with it.

00:53:01.018 --> 00:53:02.310 align:middle line:90%
But everything else is fiction.

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:03.910 align:middle line:90%
It's great entertainment.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to film a
day in my life as an illegal,

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:09.900 align:middle line:90%
everybody would go to sleep.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.645 align:middle line:90%
So what they--

00:53:11.645 --> 00:53:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they
were out murdering

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:14.440 align:middle line:90%
at night, and so forth.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: They were
murdering at night,

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:16.960 align:middle line:90%
and then they had a day job.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And then this guy was
married to another woman

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:21.840 align:middle line:90%
in the same space.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were
meeting their handler

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.110 align:middle line:84%
on the territory of
the United States.

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:29.380 align:middle line:90%
That was a documented no-no.

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.990 align:middle line:90%
This would never happen.

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Illegals did not meet their
handlers in the United States.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:36.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's put to rest.

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But some of the spy
craft, the basic things

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.673 align:middle line:84%
about getting the
tapes and decryption.

00:53:40.673 --> 00:53:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And the basic nuts
and bolts of it had--

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Well, even--

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --some truth, right?

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: No, not really.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:49.578 align:middle line:84%
Even you know, when they
listen to the radio,

00:53:49.578 --> 00:53:51.120 align:middle line:84%
they got their stuff
through numbers.

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Number stations, they're called.

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Their code was spoken.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.970 align:middle line:90%
1-5-6-8.

00:53:57.970 --> 00:53:59.538 align:middle line:90%
I got Morse code.

00:53:59.538 --> 00:54:00.830 align:middle line:90%
There's a good reason for that.

00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:03.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to get into detail.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.710 align:middle line:84%
All of this was
dramatically enhanced.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it this way.

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of it was taken
out of the truth,

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:12.310 align:middle line:84%
but nothing really I could
say was absolutely real.

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
maybe the only thing

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:16.352 align:middle line:84%
in common with your life in that
is you both got called home.

00:54:16.352 --> 00:54:17.540 align:middle line:90%
You didn't go, they did.

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Right.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And the best part of it was the
one scene where I was an extra.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:24.430 align:middle line:90%
What episode was that?

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: 5-11.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Five.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.370 align:middle line:90%
Season five, number 11.

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Go look for Jack if anyone
wants to watch the series.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get on to what's
going on in modern times.

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:34.605 align:middle line:90%
We talked about it at the top.

00:54:34.605 --> 00:54:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And you said--
because I've never

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:40.900 align:middle line:84%
seen this amount of confusion,
distraction, disinformation.

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The media is churning
it out over time.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But also social media
platforms, which I am positive

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I've identified a couple that
are actually Russian-backed.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And so you said the
sadness of this time

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:58.990 align:middle line:84%
is we've now been split
in America into two

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:00.140 align:middle line:90%
ideological camps.

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Fundamentally.

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can you explain
that from your point of view

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:03.850 align:middle line:90%
to us?

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Well,
you see, what I see

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:12.890 align:middle line:84%
here is that we totally forgot
what we have in common as

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:19.160 align:middle line:84%
opposed to what we don't have
in common with other societies.

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Other countries with countries
like Russia and China

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.020 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.290 align:middle line:84%
We're being threatened
from the outside world.

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:29.248 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing
is we're helping.

00:55:29.248 --> 00:55:31.040 align:middle line:84%
We're helping actually
increase that threat

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.300 align:middle line:90%
by not being united.

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And what the Russians
are doing now,

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:40.280 align:middle line:84%
they've been doing throughout
the existence of the KGB,

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.850 align:middle line:90%
which is called disinformation.

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And sowing discord within
democracies such as ours.

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.650 align:middle line:90%
They're not just doing it here.

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:53.233 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it in
Europe and they're

00:55:53.233 --> 00:55:54.540 align:middle line:90%
doing it in other places.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How high does it go?

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:58.040 align:middle line:90%
To what levels?

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.470 align:middle line:84%
In terms of infiltrating
media and so forth.

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: I think it
comes from the very top.

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:06.890 align:middle line:84%
In the days of the KGB,
when Andropov took over,

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:09.440 align:middle line:84%
he made what's called
active measures.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what this is
called in the business.

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:13.520 align:middle line:90%
He made this a priority.

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To embed
in the US media.

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: To plant falsehoods.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Plant
false information.

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Absolutely.

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Through the media.

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And they used
to do it, you know,

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:22.220 align:middle line:84%
in the print media
and maybe the radio.

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:26.000 align:middle line:84%
But now by the internet,
it is so much easier.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
it is very difficult

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:31.040 align:middle line:84%
even for well-informed
people to know

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.500 align:middle line:90%
the truth, truth from fiction.

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:37.070 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of research
and a lot of background

00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:39.980 align:middle line:84%
to at least have an instinctive
understanding that can be true.

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Most Americans don't
have that tool set.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot
of naive believers

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:45.230 align:middle line:90%
in all kinds of stories.

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.610 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:48.193 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And then
they get propagated

00:56:48.193 --> 00:56:49.310 align:middle line:90%
through our social media.

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:50.565 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knows what anymore.

00:56:50.565 --> 00:56:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They don't.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my friends,
the biggest--

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and they're intelligent,
they have degrees.

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's true anymore
is the most common statement.

00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And you have these social
media platforms and these blogs

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and vlogs and so forth that
are diametrically opposed

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.500 align:middle line:84%
to information that get
people all hopped up to--

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.420 align:middle line:90%
especially the conspiracy sites.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the one thing is
the arrogance of feeling

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.790 align:middle line:84%
you're in the know when
other people aren't.

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: True.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:16.963 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's appealing
to that vanity in Americans

00:57:16.963 --> 00:57:19.070 align:middle line:84%
who want to be special
and feel in the know.

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:21.170 align:middle line:90%
And you can feed us anything.

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And here's
the long-term problem.

00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:26.930 align:middle line:84%
With that kind of a mindset,
eventually the country

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:29.990 align:middle line:84%
itself could be subject
to the manipulation

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:31.850 align:middle line:90%
to a real dictator.

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:33.770 align:middle line:84%
This could happen in
this country because--

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:34.645 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see that.

00:57:34.645 --> 00:57:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --we are rudderless.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.430 align:middle line:84%
We are floating
out in the ocean,

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:40.348 align:middle line:84%
and we don't even know what's
going on and where we're going.

00:57:40.348 --> 00:57:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the same
time, you know, we're

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.780 align:middle line:84%
looking at situations in our
country where a lot of people

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:46.590 align:middle line:84%
feel we're now vulnerable
to the Russians.

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:48.758 align:middle line:90%
Let me answer that question.

00:57:48.758 --> 00:57:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm looking at.

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.925 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And I think
we are paying way

00:57:51.925 --> 00:57:53.720 align:middle line:90%
too much attention to Russia.

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: There's a list that
I just came across that lists

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.310 align:middle line:90%
people by wealth--

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:02.120 align:middle line:90%
not people.

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Countries.

00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Russia is number 15
with just about 1%

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:10.790 align:middle line:84%
of the wealth of
the entire Earth.

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The United States is number
one with close to 30%.

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: China has to be--

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: --China's number two.

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Two.

00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: So we need to
pay attention to China.

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:24.380 align:middle line:84%
China is-- China is
much better organized.

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Has a much better
long-term plan.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:29.318 align:middle line:84%
It is not dependent
upon just one person.

00:58:29.318 --> 00:58:30.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
happened-- what's

00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:34.050 align:middle line:90%
going to happen past Putin.

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:37.532 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at people
like the FBI and the CIA,

00:58:37.532 --> 00:58:38.990 align:middle line:84%
they will tell you
the same thing--

00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:42.620 align:middle line:84%
China is a bigger
threat than Russia.

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:47.260 align:middle line:84%
The one reason you need to play
nice with Russia, in some way,

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:50.990 align:middle line:84%
is because they have half the
nuclear arms on the planet.

00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:52.100 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And what about just the
interference to help

00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:58.750 align:middle line:84%
break down our own
society and have

00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:00.140 align:middle line:90%
us fighting with each other.

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.320 align:middle line:84%
How can we-- this will
be my final question.

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.230 align:middle line:84%
How can we as more
naive Americans

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:08.363 align:middle line:84%
begin to discern when
we're being played?

00:59:08.363 --> 00:59:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because you
said a lot of people

00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:13.690 align:middle line:84%
don't have these basic
emotional, spiritual filters

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that say hey, this doesn't
feel right, I'm not buying it.

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:20.137 align:middle line:84%
We're being-- our minds are
being clouded and confused.

00:59:20.137 --> 00:59:21.970 align:middle line:84%
What would be the first
thing you'd tell us.

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: This is
so complicated.

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:25.810 align:middle line:84%
If I were a dictator
in the US, I

00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:28.810 align:middle line:84%
would make everybody take
another history course

00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:31.135 align:middle line:84%
as a requirement for
keeping your job.

00:59:31.135 --> 00:59:34.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we don't really--

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:35.440 align:middle line:90%
American history.

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Americans think history,
anything past three months old

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:43.280 align:middle line:84%
is already, we don't need
to pay attention to that.

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.950 align:middle line:90%
And that, you know--

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:46.870 align:middle line:84%
there's a famous
statement, and I forgot

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:48.820 align:middle line:90%
who came up with that one.

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:52.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you ignore history,
you are liable to repeat it.

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To repeat it.

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: And that,
in our day and age,

00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.880 align:middle line:90%
that is the end of the world.

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Because World War
3 will destroy us.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So history lesson.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And also, taking
some of the blinders

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:13.530 align:middle line:84%
off to not always buy the
most salacious, the thing that

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.660 align:middle line:84%
is most ego-gratifying,
and to look

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.250 align:middle line:84%
at the hardcore nuts and bolts
of what's really going on.

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Who's saying what?

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Who's being pitted against whom?

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:21.990 align:middle line:90%
How does that feel?

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, I watch
who is standing up

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and what I consider to be a
genuinely ethical or moral way.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:32.280 align:middle line:90%
That matters to me a lot.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.110 align:middle line:84%
If the entire
country, if all of us

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:37.470 align:middle line:84%
started thinking in that
way, examining in that way,

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:40.260 align:middle line:84%
even if we are being
lied to, and just started

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
feeling our way through it
on a psycho-spiritual level,

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:47.835 align:middle line:84%
I think we could find our way
to some better decision making.

01:00:47.835 --> 01:00:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: I agree with you.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is to just, like,

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
actually engage in
a dialogue and not

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.027 align:middle line:84%
operate in a circle of
people who think like you.

01:00:58.027 --> 01:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Echo
chambers, they call it.

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:01.305 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: The old
echo chamber, right.

01:01:01.305 --> 01:01:02.105 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:01:02.105 --> 01:01:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Talk with others who
think the opposite.

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yes.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.870 align:middle line:90%
And keep an open mind.

01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Not everything
that you believe--

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:11.543 align:middle line:84%
and that happens to me
fundamentally on a daily basis.

01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:12.960 align:middle line:84%
My wife will point
out some things

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
that I think to be the truth
that they're not the truth.

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Be willing to accept that
whatever you believe in

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:21.480 align:middle line:90%
may not be 100% truth.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.930 align:middle line:84%
A little humility would
go a long way in all of us

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:27.602 align:middle line:84%
that are so attached to
our sides of the story.

01:01:27.602 --> 01:01:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: That's right.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And start
talking to others.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I've started doing
that with friends

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:34.532 align:middle line:84%
who are across the other side in
their beliefs on these things.

01:01:34.532 --> 01:01:35.740 align:middle line:90%
And just seeing where we're--

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and my whole goal
is to see where

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:42.060 align:middle line:84%
we have something in common,
what we all are hoping for.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Just coming at it
through different lenses.

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSKY: Yeah.

01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:48.310 align:middle line:10%
You know what we have in common?

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:51.370 align:middle line:10%
We all pretty much
want to be good people

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:54.060 align:middle line:10%
and very often don't know
exactly what that means

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:57.630 align:middle line:10%
and how to implement
this in practice.

01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:59.610 align:middle line:10%
And so you wind
up like me, who, I

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:01.410 align:middle line:10%
thought I was a
good person, doing

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:03.698 align:middle line:10%
a lot of bad things
for a long time.

01:02:03.698 --> 01:02:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that,
we'll say goodbye.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Jack, thank you so much.

01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming forward.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for-- I'm
glad you were busted.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.790 align:middle line:90%
And that puts you here today.

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And also your daughter
for coming with you.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is going to
be very interesting to people

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:21.820 align:middle line:84%
to look inside a completely
different way of living,

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
thinking, and becoming who
you ultimately are today.

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSKY: Thanks for your
great, insightful questions.

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I hope you
enjoyed these conversations

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:32.700 align:middle line:10%
as much as I have.

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.430 align:middle line:10%
And I urge you to pick up
a copy of "Deep Undercover"

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:37.470 align:middle line:10%
to learn more nuance
of this story.

01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And also to see the afterword
from FBI Agent Joe Riley.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.303 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

01:02:42.303 --> 01:02:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.920 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.570 align:middle line:90%
