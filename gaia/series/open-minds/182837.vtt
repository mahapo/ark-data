00:00:20.293 --> 00:00:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Jared Zeizel is

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.380 align:middle line:84%
with us again to expand
our story on dreaming.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:10%
In our last
conversation, we spoke

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:10%
about entering into a
conscious dreaming state where

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.662 align:middle line:10%
we could become conscious
players in our dreams.

00:00:31.662 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Today, we look at the
importance of telling our dream

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:90%
stories to one another.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Much can be revealed
when we do this.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
We can also begin to see where
real life meets the dream

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a really
important part of the story,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.672 align:middle line:90%
Jared, and welcome back.

00:00:44.672 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JARED ZEIZEL: Thank you
for having me back on here.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to craft
this story as we go along.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But this is part of indigenous
cultures' daily practice

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.820 align:middle line:90%
to share dreams.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And in our world, dreams
often get a giggle factor.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like, ah, whatever.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:90%
It's just a dream--

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:90%
some random firing of the brain.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is not where
you're coming from at all.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
This is an experience
where we're literally able,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:84%
if we cared to, harness
collective intelligence

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:90%
and far beyond that.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: It's an amazing thing.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:10%
And I feel bad that you
essentially grew up hearing--

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.465 align:middle line:10%
if we had a nightmare
as kids, we'd

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:10%
be told like, oh,
don't worry about it.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:10%
It's just a dream.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:10%
And in reality, it's
not just a dream.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
It's our inner world
projected to us.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And stuff to learn and
stuff to fix, and understand,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:90%
and grow.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And indigenous cultures
all around the world

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:84%
throughout history,
in the morning,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things
they would do would be--

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:90%
they would share their dreams.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Because they believe
that the dream wasn't

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
just for them, but it was
actually for the community.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.295 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, and
rightfully, in the direction

00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:84%
you're going right
now, the thing

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:84%
about dreams that's so
interesting is we have a plot.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:90%
We have characters.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:90%
We have heroes.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:90%
We have themes.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:84%
All of this is within
the dream state.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:90%
And these are stories.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Mhm.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.593 align:middle line:84%
And the fundamental
building blocks

00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:84%
of stories, something
we're all familiar with,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:84%
are, just like you said,
character, plot, growth, theme.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.393 align:middle line:84%
And all that stuff is
evident in the dream world.

00:02:31.393 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:84%
We'll go through
different events.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the plot.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:90%
We're the hero, actually.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're meeting
these other characters.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And even people talk
about reoccurring dreams.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll have the same
dream every night,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
or every night, there's
a monster chasing me.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
theme right there.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:10%
I remember reading in a book
by Ruth Montgomery called

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:10%
"A World Beyond" years
ago, many years ago.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:10%
The newly passed over deceased
person who was a medium

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:10%
named Arthur Ford was shared.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.843 align:middle line:84%
Because he was dead now, and he
was, through automatic writing,

00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
communicating with
her and saying,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm
seeing over here.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.253 align:middle line:84%
And he was seeing
some of these themes

00:03:12.253 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
that we often encounter in
dream time, like this one woman.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:90%
And it just struck me.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:90%
It stuck with me.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.380 align:middle line:84%
There was this one woman
that he saw on the other side

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.563 align:middle line:90%
spend all her time ironing.

00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:23.363 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, wow.

00:03:23.363 --> 00:03:24.446 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She just ironed.

00:03:24.446 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:90%
That was her life.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, I was talking
to my sister about dreams

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:90%
one time.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And she was saying, well,
mostly, I'm just ironing.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And she's a professional
woman in cardiac care,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:84%
ironing or maybe stirring a
pot, doing some really mundane

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:90%
household chores.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
She said, that's all I
remember from the dream world.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.690 align:middle line:90%
How is that even possible?

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about it.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:90%
So for her, there's no story.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't like to
talk about dreams.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So in a case like that,
you might want to kind of--

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:84%
or she can see, essentially,
if she can incubate a dream

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:90%
that she would want to have.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Instead of ironing,
oh, maybe I'll

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:90%
go fight crime in my dream.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:84%
That also puts weight
on lucid dreaming,

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
which is being aware of the
dream while it's happening.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And once you're lucid, you
can start directing the dream,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.075 align:middle line:84%
interacting with
it, changing it.

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to say
you have a lucid dream,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:90%
and you're not ironing anymore.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:84%
You might just be consciously
ironing in the dream.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But you can say, hey, I want
to put the iron down and go

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:90%
see what's in the next room.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.073 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll just let it sit
here and burn the house down.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:84%
See what happens, and
just change it a little.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:84%
The dream world,
it can be this sort

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.787 align:middle line:84%
of sandbox, this playground,
where you can experiment.

00:04:50.787 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
You can see what
happens if you just--

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once you're able
to consciously engage.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:90%
And your book talks about this.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a guide to lucid dreaming.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, there's a
lot to learn from dreams,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:90%
whether you're lucid or not.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But when you become lucid,
it doesn't automatically

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:90%
change the dream.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It just gives you
the ability to engage

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:90%
with it in a different way.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And going back to the
notion of sharing the dreams

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and the storytelling that
happens as a result of dreams,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the
fact that as people, we

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
have a deep need
to tell our stories

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and to hear one
another's stories.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.865 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think
that comes from?

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: I think
it's part of it

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
is just wanting to
connect with each other.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is a desire for
empathy and reminding ourselves

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.880 align:middle line:84%
that we're essentially not in
this crazy existence alone.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's something
mundane, like you

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.592 align:middle line:84%
got into a little
fender bender, you're

00:05:50.592 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
definitely going
to tell that story

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:90%
when you come home from work.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Or it's something new.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:84%
If you find a $50
bill on the ground,

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:84%
you'd probably tell
the next 10 people

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
you run into, as long as you
don't think it's their $50.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
innate desire, almost,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.483 align:middle line:84%
to just share what's going on in
our life, which is always weird

00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:17.570 align:middle line:84%
when I think about that
we hardly share our dreams

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and that it's not
going on outside of us,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:90%
but it's something going on--

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's a huge
part of our life cycle.

00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Definitely.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We dream a lot.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
A huge percentage of our
life is spent in dream.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, yeah.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like if a third
is spent just asleep--

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sleeping.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.192 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: It's something like--

00:06:34.192 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I might have the stat
off-- but essentially, it's

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.105 align:middle line:84%
like six years or something
in the dream world.

00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In dream time, yeah.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: That's a
whole existence there.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And on this subject, when
you talk about storytelling,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:84%
it brings to mind that not
long ago, about a month ago,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.440 align:middle line:90%
I was listening to a piece on--

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
it was either Inside
or NPR, Sirius Radio

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:90%
as I was driving along.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And I got in part way
through the story,

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:90%
so I don't have all the details.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:90%
But I got to the heart of it.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And that was, the
person was saying,

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
when they were
examining storytelling

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:84%
more from a scientific
point of view,

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
the thing that
makes it so profound

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
compared to giving data,
giving information to people,

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
is that it involves all
aspects of the mind.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
When you're telling
a story, you're

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
having to draw upon your
ability to form pictures,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
to imagine what the sound or the
words were like in that dream.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you're doing just
mental imagery alone,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
you're drawing in everything
in your context for what

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:90%
life is in your world, right?

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And so your mind is having to
construct something, really,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
from itself, which brings
people into the absolute

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:90%
now, into the moment.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:90%
I have to look that up.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:84%
It was really fascinating
because when we're enraptured

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
is when we're hearing
someone tell their story.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:90%
And everything falls away.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Time falls away.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And as you're laying
out all these things,

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.210 align:middle line:84%
such as present awareness, using
the mind to essentially build

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
out this world that's
being told to you,

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:84%
it all makes sense, especially
when comparing storytelling

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:90%
and dreaming.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Because in the--

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.087 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or taking a class
in algebra or something.

00:08:22.087 --> 00:08:23.432 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:23.432 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:90%
But huh?

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, right.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.012 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: I had this World
War II history teacher who--

00:08:30.012 --> 00:08:32.095 align:middle line:84%
I thought the class was
going to be really boring,

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.615 align:middle line:84%
but he was such a
phenomenal story--

00:08:33.615 --> 00:08:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Storyteller, yes.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.245 align:middle line:90%
He brought us back to--

00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And see, that's
a really good point

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.654 align:middle line:90%
you're making.

00:08:40.654 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're off the topic of
dreams for just a moment here,

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
but we're on the
subject of storytelling.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that if it
were a requirement

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.230 align:middle line:84%
in the field of education
that a teacher had

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:84%
to know how to hold
attention by storytelling.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, it doesn't
matter what the subject is.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It can be mathematics.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:90%
It can be history.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.035 align:middle line:84%
It can all come alive and
anchor you into the moment,

00:09:03.035 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:84%
if they know how
to tell a story.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
what's focused on.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:90%
It's always data.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, here are
the facts to memorize.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.997 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you memorize
it for the test,

00:09:10.997 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:90%
and then they float away.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
Industrial Age education.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just to stuff
a few facts in there

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and then send you out to
become a worker somewhere.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But I think this, what
you're saying about dreams,

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:84%
extends to all of life, starting
to really learn how to tell

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.620 align:middle line:90%
our story in an engaging way.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that ability to
bring someone's attention

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:90%
to the now, to the present--

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:84%
we've got so many distractions
going on from our phones,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
just to our work life,
to our family life, that

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:84%
to really capture
all that attention,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%
even just for a couple
minutes, can be truly powerful.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.687 align:middle line:84%
And we've all been told a
story that has pulled us in.

00:09:54.687 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:90%
So we know what that feels like.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.350 align:middle line:84%
We've watched a movie where
the time just flies by.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's an experience
that we are

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.355 align:middle line:84%
very familiar with,
but just not usually

00:10:04.355 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:84%
when someone's
telling the dream.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.945 align:middle line:84%
Because often, when, they're
talking about a dream,

00:10:08.945 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
they're usually saying,
oh, I had this crazy dream.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:90%
They're already dismissing it.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Denigrating it.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.705 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah, right before
they even launch into the story

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've
lost their attention

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
because they're thinking, oh,
this is some made up stuff.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.262 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah, if I'm
telling you a dream,

00:10:22.262 --> 00:10:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and I don't care about
the dream, what's going

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
to make you care about it?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's like when we put
a little importance--

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and we don't need to say,
I'm telling you a dream,

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and everyone needs to gather
around and hear my story.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But we just give it a
little bit more weight

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:90%
when we're telling it.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a story that
we've gone through and that

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.115 align:middle line:90%
is part of us.

00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
you observe in communities.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you work
with the Dream Lab,

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and you work in communities
of dreamers and such.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:84%
What do you see happening
when people start actually

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.367 align:middle line:84%
actively sharing their dreams
as a practice with one another?

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Well, I
think one thing that

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
happens, as with
all storytelling,

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:90%
is usually empathy grows.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
You put yourself in someone
else's shoes, and you connect.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And you essentially
feel and can imagine

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.258 align:middle line:90%
what that person went through.

00:11:17.258 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing that kind
of in the present moment,

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
you're almost sort
of subconsciously

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:84%
going through that
experience yourself.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So you're initially creating
a shared experience.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to
that, as we know,

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:90%
dreams can be very fanciful.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:90%
It can be fluid.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:84%
It can be even quite
confusing at times.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Because our mind will
project these metaphors

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that don't quite make
sense on the surface.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.785 align:middle line:84%
But once we start talking
about it, someone might--

00:11:47.785 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
especially someone
close to you--

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It triggers something.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be like, oh, that
reminds me of the time you did,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:90%
blank.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.303 align:middle line:84%
And then that person
will be like, oh, yeah.

00:11:56.303 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that the dream
is connected to that.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it gives a lot of key
subconscious information.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I remember even when-- like
my sister's dream on ironing

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
or stirring a pot or
whatever, she's like,

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to talk about that.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.608 align:middle line:84%
I don't like my dream time at
all because it's so boring.

00:12:16.608 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing going on there.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
She's stuck in
some kind of loop.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Where conversely, when
my son was even little,

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I remember his
dreams-- he was always

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:84%
kind of the defender
of his people, right?

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And so there would
be the boogey man,

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
the bad guy who might
be some guy that

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.820 align:middle line:90%
comes onto a ship with a knife.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And he's coming after my
son and all his friends.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And my son will kind of
always take one for the team

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:90%
and protect all of the buddies.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.062 align:middle line:84%
And I remember all
these dramatic dreams,

00:12:45.062 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and I bring this
up because I think

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
it's a little more
male, where there's

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:84%
this violence in these dreams
and this threat of violence.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And this one, in particular,
really stands out.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, I had a dream
about you last night, Mom.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
We were over at
the grocery store.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and a man
was trying to kill us.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:90%
And so he set us on fire.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I saw
your body burning up,

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.890 align:middle line:84%
so there was nothing left
but your neck and your head.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:13.898 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh my.

00:13:13.898 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
said, and I realized

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want you to die alone,
so I let him burn me up, too.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So that was the nature
of all of his dreams.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:84%
He was always like the
hero to protect the masses.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- there
always had this kind

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:84%
of attack coming, which, let's
talk about that kind of theme

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:84%
just for a moment before
we go into the rest

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.273 align:middle line:90%
of the storytelling.

00:13:34.273 --> 00:13:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Because this seems to
emerge a lot from men's

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:90%
dreams in particular.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, first off, your son
sounds like an amazing person.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
We all could benefit
from someone kind

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:90%
of having a protector.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But the violence you
mentioned, it makes sense.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:90%
We live in a violent world.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Especially as the access
to information grows,

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:84%
we learn more about
the troubling conflicts

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:10.520 align:middle line:84%
In addition to media, it's
something that is with us.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And so naturally,
it's part of culture.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It's going to kind of
flow into our dreams.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But something else that has
kind of flowed into our dreams

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
are these archetypes or
tropes of characters.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.863 align:middle line:84%
You talk your son being
this protector of sorts.

00:14:27.863 --> 00:14:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, interesting.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.650 align:middle line:84%
His name is Stuart, which is
steward, which is protector.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
what his name means.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I hadn't
really put those

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.125 align:middle line:90%
two together until this moment.

00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: That's
kind of amazing.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's like
names themselves.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:84%
We give people names
because we want

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:84%
them to hold the attributes
that that name might mean.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we see these
characters and these heroes

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
on TV representing something
that initially was created

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:90%
to represent humanity and us.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And so as we write these
stories and just sort of create

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
culture, that flows
into our dreams.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if your son is having
dreams of protecting people,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.200 align:middle line:84%
it would make sense
that he connects

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:90%
with the role of the protector.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of the protector.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.295 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Exactly.

00:15:24.295 --> 00:15:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and even
though his name was simply

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
my father's name
that I gave him,

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.600 align:middle line:84%
my father has that
same tendency as well.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you look
into the dream world,

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I've had dreams of both of
them as Knight Templar who

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:90%
were working together.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, wow.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My father was
his teacher in times past,

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient times
of the Templar.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, yeah.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I'm just now
putting all these things

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.250 align:middle line:84%
together because we're
talking about it.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.167 align:middle line:90%
We're sharing stories.

00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah, there you go.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's sort of
the proof is in the pudding.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's experience
is like, once you just

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:84%
get talking about something
and neither party is being

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
dismissive about the
topic, you really

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.400 align:middle line:84%
start to make these
connections and stuff.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's beyond
dreaming or storytelling.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here just in
this little conversation,

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.207 align:middle line:84%
these little threads
have come up.

00:16:11.207 --> 00:16:14.003 align:middle line:84%
And I started seeing a
much larger story emerging

00:16:14.003 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:84%
historically through
that with these two

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:90%
people, my father and my son.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, totally.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this protective
role that they take in life.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's like,
obviously, dream sharing is

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
talking about dreams,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
we start to make
these connections.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
want to, essentially,

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:84%
kind of grow the
idea or add to it,

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:42.250 align:middle line:84%
we can start looking at other
archetypes, other stories,

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and really kind
of blend the idea

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
of the cultural storytelling
with these very interpersonal

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.712 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:16:50.712 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
these architects types

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.410 align:middle line:90%
take on a much greater depth.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.868 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important to also

00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:84%
to note that the archetypes
mean different things

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
in different cultures
and societies.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:84%
There's not a paste-on
one-size-fits-all.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
However, the notion that there
are people within society,

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:90%
for example, that are there to--

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.839 align:middle line:84%
and gain their joy through
protecting others, that

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:12.620 align:middle line:90%
does exist in all cultures.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:84%
You have these
sort of archetypes

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:21.069 align:middle line:84%
that span multiple cultures,
but are sometimes a little bit

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:24.819 align:middle line:84%
different, depending which
culture you're looking at.

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's also
very connected to dream,

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and also especially,
dream interpretation.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I always say if
you're interpreting the dream,

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
always keep in mind that the
dream belongs to the dreamer

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:90%
and that it is their experience.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not always
going to match up perfectly

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
If you have a dream of a jaguar,
and I have a dream of a jaguar,

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:84%
they might mean two
different things.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.422 align:middle line:84%
You might have had a really
positive experience as a kid

00:17:54.422 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:90%
seeing the jaguar in the zoo.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you decide to
become a vet, or whatever.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:84%
But maybe I had a terrible
experience with the jaguar

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.817 align:middle line:84%
on a trip or something,
or scared in a movie.

00:18:07.817 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the jaguar
represents something

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.847 align:middle line:90%
that's maybe more fear-based.

00:18:11.847 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or a combo of the two.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Or the
combo of the two.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.318 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had a tiger dream
which was a combo of the two,

00:18:16.318 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:84%
being caught in a room with a
tiger in a little white cube,

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
nowhere to go, and with
the tiger staring at me.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.760 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK, I'm scared.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.990 align:middle line:90%
But stop it.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Just stop it now,
and just communicate.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Just communicate.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And the tiger just
relaxed and laid down,

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and everything was fine.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'd mastered that
fear in that moment.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, you did.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're moving
from one to the other.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And even though we
have maybe these two different

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.330 align:middle line:84%
kind of-- the dream sign of
the jaguar means something

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:84%
different to us, we still
are members of our culture.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And we'll still
experience archetypes,

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
like protector, or leader,
or warrior, or healer.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:84%
It will show up
in different ways.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:90%
But there is this connection.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So dream interpretation
really is a combination

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:84%
of respect for the individual
and their experience,

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
but also keeping in mind the
culture that they live in.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're complex, and
they're multi-dimensional.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And if we're, I mean,
trying to articulate,

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:84%
for example, in a
story, a dream that

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:84%
has really kind of a higher
teaching function and such,

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:84%
those can be wonderful lessons
that we share with each other.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.738 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that little dream

00:19:34.738 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I just shared with you is
simply my conquering a fear.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And I had different
scenarios in life

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.320 align:middle line:84%
where I had to do
something impossible,

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.000 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, and conquer it.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at it
from just a functional

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
point of view, there
was a lot of useful kind

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.090 align:middle line:90%
of information in that dream.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Mm-hmm.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:90%
And actually--

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
them were teaching dreams.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.127 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah,
and actually, when

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about somebody
in this role of a protector,

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I went through a
period of experiences

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
where I was trying
to, essentially,

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:90%
protect my brother.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And it was also, it
was a series of dreams that

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.245 align:middle line:84%
came after this actually
other series of dreams with

00:20:17.245 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:84%
my brother, which I might
have mentioned the last--

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I think we did.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.702 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Essentially
that my brother

00:20:22.702 --> 00:20:24.633 align:middle line:84%
was an annoying
figure in my life,

00:20:24.633 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying
to push him away.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.217 align:middle line:84%
And I had this intense dream
where we had teamed up,

00:20:28.217 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and I realized I can't
push my brother away.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But then this series of dreams
came where I was a protector.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And up until this moment, I
never really gave much weight

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.385 align:middle line:90%
to that kind of--

00:20:40.385 --> 00:20:41.273 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The role.

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: The role
of that, and the sort

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:84%
of-- because it was in
the wake of this much more

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:84%
intense series of dreams
that I learned a lot from.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even I dismissed
the dreams a little bit, too.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But now thinking, I was like,
oh, I shouldn't have done that.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you had never shared
your dream about your son,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I would have been
just lost in time.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's beautiful.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so here we
have a little kind

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
of living, real time example of
just, without any intention--

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of Bluetoothing
in a little information

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and remembering a
thing here and there.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And now we have this
experience where you start

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.853 align:middle line:90%
seeing the roles your brother--

00:21:19.853 --> 00:21:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that was, actually, you weren't
taking that role seriously

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:90%
to an extent.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Even before that, I had
planned, like, all right,

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:84%
if I have to talk
about a dream, this

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
is the one I'm
going to talk about.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.380 align:middle line:90%
But this comes up.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even remember this.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: And it's just amazing.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.937 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love we're
doing that thing.

00:21:33.937 --> 00:21:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I think, too, because of
the collective consciousness,

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me one of the
greatest values of dream

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:90%
sharing is that it can--

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:84%
like this, but even
in a larger scale--

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:84%
can start triggering
things that are

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.900 align:middle line:84%
trying to emerge in society
through the collective

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Even from other dimensions
and other worlds,

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.278 align:middle line:84%
we can start seeing these
big themes that are rising

00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:90%
if we tell these stories.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
maybe any examples

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.875 align:middle line:84%
of where themes have arisen
when dreams have been shared?

00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:07.675 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:22:07.675 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing-- and actually,
this isn't even dream-related,

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.090 align:middle line:84%
but just this year,
I've been talking

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:90%
with my friends and colleagues.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And we were all
actually expressing

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:84%
a certain degree of anxiety
about the future and stuff.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And next time I bring
it up, I'm actually

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
going to ask what
their dreams are.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Because myself, I've
just been having

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:90%
more anxiety-driven dreams.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But what I've found is that
as we start talking about kind

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:84%
of what we're going through,
and that's like, wait a second,

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.640 align:middle line:84%
we're all kind of going through
this transition, this anxiety.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.200 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we're
all a little bit optimistic.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And if we hadn't shared those
stories and those feelings,

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:84%
we'd probably feel a little
bit more anxious, a little more

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:01.570 align:middle line:90%
closed in.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isolated.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Isolated.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.840 align:middle line:90%
And that I actually--

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:90%
I know this specific friend.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
When I ask, when I see him
again when I get back home,

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, wait, what
have you been dreaming about?

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And just to see
if it's something

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:90%
that I've been going through.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think in that
whole notion of anxiety

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I think is filtering
through society at large.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.333 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of anxiety--

00:23:23.333 --> 00:23:24.375 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, definitely.

00:23:24.375 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --a lot
of polarization.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hearing the same
thing from people in my world,

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:84%
where they're not
sleeping as well

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and where their dreams
are more anxious.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
They're just more
kind of challenged

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and troubled than usual.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.932 align:middle line:84%
And the sad thing
is that a lot times

00:23:38.932 --> 00:23:42.488 align:middle line:84%
when we have these sort of
anxious or negative dreams--

00:23:42.488 --> 00:23:43.530 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't feel good.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:47.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not a feel-good experience,
like some dreams are.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:90%
You probably, you push it away.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:84%
You try to forget it or really
just get along with your day.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is especially
with the more negative-based

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.252 align:middle line:84%
dreams, that those are
the ones, actually, that

00:24:00.252 --> 00:24:01.210 align:middle line:90%
should be talked about.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:01.570 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:02.445 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:02.445 --> 00:24:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: --it's something
that is in pain inside of you.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about stuff, we
can find ways to ease the pain.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And at the very least, we remind
ourselves, like, oh, we're

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:90%
not in it alone.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:84%
We're all having
difficult dreams.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:84%
We're all in anxiety
in this world.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:23.045 align:middle line:84%
And just the act of talking
about it can do wonders.

00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, imagine
in that situation

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.420 align:middle line:84%
where all your friends are
having this anxious dream,

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and then if you start talking
about it, how that applies,

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.360 align:middle line:84%
what might be inspiring
that in your waking life.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.475 align:middle line:84%
For example, ugh, I watched this
movie, or I watched the news.

00:24:39.475 --> 00:24:43.162 align:middle line:84%
And to have people start drawing
in what's causing the anxiety,

00:24:43.162 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
starting to come up

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
with solutions, societal
solutions on a small group

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you're
anxious about the world,

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:84%
it's like, well, where are you
getting your information from?

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:90%
What's your news source?

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Are they turning news
into entertainment

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:90%
to get you riled up?

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Or is it coming
from somewhere else?

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have a friend
who's just always kind

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.610 align:middle line:84%
of complaining about the
world and essentially being

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.322 align:middle line:90%
a negative influence?

00:25:16.322 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And then all this stuff
will filter into your--

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It bubbles up, and it's bubbling
up in your conversation then.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah, in
your conversation.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.665 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say, hey,
let's just make a pact.

00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's not indulge in
that stuff anymore.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.830 align:middle line:90%
And then watch how your dream--

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.122 align:middle line:84%
that's what's so cool is when
you have a group that you

00:25:30.122 --> 00:25:31.308 align:middle line:90%
can be that open with.

00:25:31.308 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:90%
And then watch how your dream--

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:90%
is you say, look.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
If we've identified the factors
making us anxious collectively,

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:84%
what if we just agree to stop
engaging with that stuff,

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and then come back and
talk about it again

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and see what's happened
to the dreamscape

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:90%
and what else is coming in.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah, and
even figure out--

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.320 align:middle line:90%
my dad's a therapist.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I'm like, oh,
I'm anxious about this,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:58.070 align:middle line:84%
he always has this phrase,
action leaves anxiety.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And so, he's like, that
action can be anything.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Usually if you're anxious
about completing the task,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.822 align:middle line:90%
just start the task.

00:26:04.822 --> 00:26:06.280 align:middle line:84%
But if it's general,
just the act--

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.447 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Generalized, yeah.

00:26:07.447 --> 00:26:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: --of doing something.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So if we're anxious, and
we're talking about it,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and we take the act to stop
talking about that something,

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:84%
or it's like, oh, we're worried
about the homeless problem

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
in our town, and you
start taking action

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:84%
towards that, then that can
relieve some of the anxiety.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And we can often
look at our dreams

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:30.350 align:middle line:84%
as sort of this canary in
the coal mine sort of way.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, my
dreams are positive.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.310 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm healing part of me.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they're still negative.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.747 align:middle line:84%
There's something I
still have to work--

00:26:40.747 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I haven't found the root
of what's upsetting me.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and now
going back to another--

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.130 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a show.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:53.070 align:middle line:90%
I must have had PBS on again.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:90%
I kind of hop around.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.397 align:middle line:84%
But both of these I'm referring
to I think were PBS shows,

00:26:56.397 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and one of them was a
weekend show they do.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the show,
"Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me."

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think it was that show.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:09.200 align:middle line:84%
But in it, they have, what
do you think is the truth?

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:90%
You give them a certain number.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
They say, how many
gallons do you know--

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.435 align:middle line:84%
whatever-- fill Lake
Erie, or whatever.

00:27:14.435 --> 00:27:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, it's
some kind of random thing

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.310 align:middle line:90%
they ask you to guess, right?

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.230 align:middle line:90%
And so I hope it's the show.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it was one of
the other shows like it.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And they have individuals
give their guesses--

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.670 align:middle line:90%
the panel of three people.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Then they have the collective
combined audience number.

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So they've asked everyone in
the audience, averaged it out.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting the
group intelligence.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And in that particular show--
and I don't know how it goes

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:84%
because I listen to
it all the time--

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.490 align:middle line:84%
in every instance
and every question,

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:84%
the group intelligence
of the audience

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.570 align:middle line:84%
was the correct answer, or
the most correct answer.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's
fascinating, just averaging out

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:90%
our collective intelligence.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So if we apply that then
to the dream world--

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this might be
getting a little off.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.390 align:middle line:90%
But hey, we can fly around.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:03.822 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: We've been
going all over the place.

00:28:03.822 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.088 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can fly around
together, so that's fine.

00:28:06.088 --> 00:28:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you're dreaming, you're
dreaming in another dimension,

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:84%
but you're also intersecting
with other dimensions.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And so, what if you have
this mass anxiety going on,

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:84%
What if you have a
lower realm of beings,

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:84%
intelligences, and so forth,
really coming in and taking

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.188 align:middle line:84%
advantage of our disrupted
psyche right now?

00:28:30.188 --> 00:28:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe there's
a lot of that happening.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.280 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of the
mystery schools, they

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.130 align:middle line:84%
would say, yes, lower realms and
higher realms both intersect.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And we seem to be experiencing
more of the lower realm

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:90%
intersection right now.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:90%
What if a player--

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.750 align:middle line:84%
one of the players
sharing their dream--

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.330 align:middle line:84%
is actually starting to
have deeper or more complex

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.760 align:middle line:84%
dreams about that
kind of intersection?

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And what if they can
articulate this stuff?

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that fascinating when
you start looking at, really,

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of deep emergent stories
from real lucid dreamers?

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:84%
No, it's the kind of
thing that, essentially--

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and I believe this is
like the deeper you

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:11.400 align:middle line:84%
can dive into yourself, the
better you understand yourself,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:84%
but also the better
you understand

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:90%
your placement in the world.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when we talk about
dream sharing and sort

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.880 align:middle line:90%
of a collective consciousness--

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.760 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if
in the dream state,

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:84%
we can actually meet and
be in that realm together.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I think it's this thing
that they're anecdotal,

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:84%
plenty of anecdotal experiences
where that's happened.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And even I have shared
connections like that.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't necessarily
have the science backing.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, but there is
circumstantial evidence.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, I know
certain people

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm really connected
with, I know

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.845 align:middle line:90%
if they come into my dream.

00:29:54.845 --> 00:29:57.053 align:middle line:84%
They're going to call me
the next day because they're

00:29:57.053 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:90%
thinking about me.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And so you just kind of
know, OK, I'm on their mind,

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.643 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to be
hearing from them.

00:30:02.643 --> 00:30:04.685 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of useful
anecdotal information--

00:30:04.685 --> 00:30:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, totally.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that you've hooked
up somehow in the dream time.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's definitely--
I feel like there's

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:84%
things we'll probably
never fully understand.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But they deserve our
attention and our weight.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And even whatever dream sharing
and collective consciousness

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.240 align:middle line:84%
might be, we do know
that in the waking world,

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.410 align:middle line:90%
we are all in this together.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.110 align:middle line:90%
We're all sharing experiences.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:33.370 align:middle line:84%
We're all seeing the
same bits of news.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:37.150 align:middle line:84%
We're experiencing the same
movies, the same stories--

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.170 align:middle line:84%
obviously, variations of
different cultures and belief

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.430 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:45.400 align:middle line:90%
But we are all here together.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And if this world
influences the dream world

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and the other worlds we might
go through, well, of course,

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.920 align:middle line:84%
there's going to
be this connection.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And having a shared
dream with someone,

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.020 align:middle line:84%
whether you actually met
up in the dream or not,

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.590 align:middle line:84%
it's still a very valid
experience, and even

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:84%
another chance to connect, and
have more empathy, and grow,

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.363 align:middle line:90%
and problem solve together.

00:31:11.363 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, since we are
problem solving and learning,

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.060 align:middle line:84%
being taught and
learning in dream time,

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.210 align:middle line:84%
being put through our paces
and even major lessons

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:84%
being taught in dream
time, something just

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:84%
occurred to me as
you were saying that,

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.970 align:middle line:84%
that we're just kind of firing
off each other here today.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
if, for example--

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.310 align:middle line:84%
again, we go back to this
mass anxiety that's going on.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a serious issue right now.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:32.565 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, total--

00:31:32.565 --> 00:31:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everywhere.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So we have this mass
anxiety going on.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:40.510 align:middle line:84%
What if we have squads
of lucid dreamers?

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And what if we have
lucid dreamers who

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:84%
understand that they're going
to go to the heart of what's

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:52.520 align:middle line:84%
creating this anxiety, and
actually, like dream warriors,

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:90%
confront it on the dream realms?

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.974 align:middle line:84%
How interesting would
that be as an experiment?

00:31:58.974 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.710 align:middle line:84%
My friend came up with a
story, like just an idea

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.210 align:middle line:90%
for a story a long time ago.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.835 align:middle line:10%
It was like, well,
what if we found out

00:32:08.835 --> 00:32:14.740 align:middle line:10%
the world was going to
end, but as dreamers, we--

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.560 align:middle line:10%
or actually, the only way to
survive the end of the world

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.930 align:middle line:10%
is basically become
a lucid dreamer

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:24.962 align:middle line:10%
and permanently enter some
other dream realm, other realm.

00:32:24.962 --> 00:32:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like,
well, there's only so many

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.530 align:middle line:90%
of lucid dreamers.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.193 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to have
that many people there.

00:32:31.193 --> 00:32:32.110 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, oh, no.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.700 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:38.980 align:middle line:10%
The lucid dreamers have to
basically teach everyone

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:10%
about how to get to that point.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't
thought about that,

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:84%
this sort of one-off story
that he came up with for years

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:47.710 align:middle line:90%
until right now.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh, maybe
his was like a very kind

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:52.668 align:middle line:90%
of sci-fi based thing.

00:32:52.668 --> 00:32:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no,
I'm not talking sci-fi.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.780 align:middle line:90%
We have problems right now.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And we've got all these
people and young guys

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.960 align:middle line:90%
who are warriors.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Historically, throughout
their incarnations,

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:05.635 align:middle line:84%
they've got the warrior gene
vibe remembrance going on.

00:33:05.635 --> 00:33:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Imagine-- and so many
young men feeling kind of

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:10.300 align:middle line:90%
lost and displaced anyway.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just now
in my head imagining

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.150 align:middle line:84%
what it would be like to
have these young men with all

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:20.410 align:middle line:84%
this passion, energy, and such
directed toward lucid dreaming

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and going in and saying,
what is disturbing our world?

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's go and work
on that together.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And doing these--
if, essentially, you

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:32.950 align:middle line:84%
have someone who is sort of
this almost lightning rod

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.272 align:middle line:84%
of all the anxiety,
and we don't know

00:33:36.272 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:90%
why we have all this anxiety.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.110 align:middle line:84%
We have guesses, but
there's essentially

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.370 align:middle line:84%
an underlying
problem that I feel

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:46.145 align:middle line:84%
like a good portion of the
planet is experiencing.

00:33:46.145 --> 00:33:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But like you said,
you have some people

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:55.030 align:middle line:84%
who really can do that that deep
dive and teach, and understand,

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.353 align:middle line:90%
and, essentially, figure out--

00:33:56.353 --> 00:33:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Discern
what it's about.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And then how do you
work with that energy?

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.680 align:middle line:84%
How do you begin to subdue
that energy from our reality,

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.610 align:middle line:90%
if possible, even?

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.850 align:middle line:84%
If it's a lower realm
influence, for example,

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:09.997 align:middle line:90%
how do you do that?

00:34:09.997 --> 00:34:11.830 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to almost
go into the dream world

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to figure that one out
because it lies somewhere

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:15.430 align:middle line:90%
where we can't see it.

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of even goes
back to storytelling.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.710 align:middle line:84%
The myths or even
the movies we watch--

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.380 align:middle line:84%
the good ones-- they have this--
you have a character who's

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.870 align:middle line:90%
troubled or wants something.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And they go through all
these trials and conflicts.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they get
what they want,

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.570 align:middle line:84%
but usually either at
a cost or a lesson.

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:41.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's a kind of thing.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.843 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, we're going
through those trials now.

00:34:44.843 --> 00:34:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we are.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And are we
going to make the call

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and essentially overcome
the conflict that we

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:90%
are collectively experiencing?

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.817 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it sounds like you

00:34:56.817 --> 00:34:58.240 align:middle line:84%
have a whole bunch
of new projects

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.740 align:middle line:84%
you could take off right here
just out of this conversation.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.630 align:middle line:90%
But you already are.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
Dream Labs Consulting

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and what you're doing
through the dream labs.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So it was maybe a little
more than a year ago.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I came to this sort
of realization.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So I gave a talk, and it
wasn't to the normal groups,

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:84%
whether a wellness group,
or meditation retreat,

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:84%
or kind of the people
I'm normally around.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:32.390 align:middle line:84%
It was all very super
successful CEOs, entrepreneurs,

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:33.740 align:middle line:90%
executive types.

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.460 align:middle line:84%
They all had very open minds,
which was a good transition.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But I realized, these
aren't the normal people

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about dreams with.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But they were very
receptive to it.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
couple people who

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.610 align:middle line:84%
were like, oh, I
think you're just

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:54.220 align:middle line:90%
kind of spouting off some BS.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, no.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.410 align:middle line:90%
I try to explain it.

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of them the very
next day came up to me.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.890 align:middle line:84%
He was like, oh, I'm
sorry for calling you out.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:90%
I had a lucid dream last night.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't even
realize it was a thing.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that moment, I
was like, oh, you know what?

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:16.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole group of people
and companies that aren't--

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:84%
it's not even-- they're
not pushing it away.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.690 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
even know about it.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what, with the
Dream Labs Consulting,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do is, you
reach out to these groups

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:29.270 align:middle line:84%
or find these spaces or
these individuals who

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.660 align:middle line:84%
normally wouldn't have
anything to do with dreaming.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:36.830 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones who would
basically have the thinking

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:39.020 align:middle line:90%
that, oh, it's just a dream.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.450 align:middle line:90%
And talk to them and try--

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not trying to
necessarily convert everyone

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:48.440 align:middle line:84%
to become a lucid
dreaming warrior of sorts,

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.380 align:middle line:84%
but just to give dreams
a little bit more focus.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Because at least I believe
and what I've found

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:84%
is that dreams are this
mirror to ourselves

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.950 align:middle line:90%
and the culture that we're in.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we can look
at that mirror--

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.720 align:middle line:84%
like, I looked in the
mirror to get ready today,

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.147 align:middle line:90%
and maybe I missed a button.

00:37:06.147 --> 00:37:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's only until
I looked into that

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.147 align:middle line:84%
mirror that I could actually
say, oh, I missed the button.

00:37:10.147 --> 00:37:12.500 align:middle line:90%
I need to fix my shirt.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can get more
people, especially more people

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.550 align:middle line:84%
in positions of great
influence and power

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.353 align:middle line:84%
and who have lots of
money, to start just

00:37:22.353 --> 00:37:24.020 align:middle line:84%
thinking a little bit
more about dreams,

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I think it will have this subtle
effect of making some change

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and fixing some of the
problems and mainly

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:35.402 align:middle line:84%
this sort of collective
anxiety that we all have.

00:37:35.402 --> 00:37:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
important because that

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.340 align:middle line:84%
is the gateway to
our super conscious

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.990 align:middle line:90%
and our subconscious both.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the beauty
of the dream world.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:84%
You can be bringing
through the absolute genius

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of your being and the absolute
worst programmed traits

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.980 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
dragging around for who

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.070 align:middle line:84%
knows how many lifetimes,
called the subconscious.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And it might be that the
time's up now for review

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:84%
to iron out something
that's been long embedded

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.798 align:middle line:84%
in the subconscious mind
and need some working on,

00:38:04.798 --> 00:38:06.590 align:middle line:84%
whether it's being in
a room with the tiger

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.590 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:10.190 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I completely agree
because we are

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:18.500 align:middle line:84%
pre-programmed to believe
in certain things, just

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:84%
either based on our
upbringing, the environment,

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.410 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
religion we believe in.

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.050 align:middle line:84%
One thing I just
noticed is, usually,

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:28.910 align:middle line:84%
someone's favorite
sports team, it's

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:30.160 align:middle line:90%
just the city they're born in.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.827 align:middle line:84%
They didn't line up
all the sports teams

00:38:31.827 --> 00:38:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and be like, all right, I like
the philosophy of these guys.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.000 align:middle line:84%
But this guy donates
to charity a lot.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.880 align:middle line:84%
We just-- we were born
in that city to know--

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just a program.

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Just a program.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.307 align:middle line:84%
And now this is
our favorite team.

00:38:44.307 --> 00:38:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And we will literally
fight someone

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.960 align:middle line:90%
to defend it, without even--

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.580 align:middle line:90%
it's just city pride.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But I think we always should be
aware that we have blind spots.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We have the sort of
pre-programmed components

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.680 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Unless we take an honest look
at ourselves-- and at least,

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.790 align:middle line:90%
in my way--

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:84%
through our dreams, we
will never fully realize

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.530 align:middle line:84%
where we might have
certain shortcomings,

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.253 align:middle line:90%
or we might be actually hurting.

00:39:15.253 --> 00:39:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree because
our mind is too programmed

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.687 align:middle line:90%
to tell us these reflections.

00:39:18.687 --> 00:39:21.020 align:middle line:84%
You almost have to get out
of your mind into dream world

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.250 align:middle line:84%
to have who you truly are
reflected back to you.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And the classic
nightmare usually is

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:84%
your mind so desperately
trying to give you

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.180 align:middle line:84%
a piece of information, that
it's willing to terrify you,

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:34.932 align:middle line:84%
and make you scared, and wake
up with your heart pounding.

00:39:34.932 --> 00:39:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Get your attention.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: It just wants
to get your attention.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So another
thing is not just

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.240 align:middle line:84%
sharing our dreams by
way of storytelling,

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.480 align:middle line:84%
but you think it's really
important to record them.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.607 align:middle line:90%
Why record the dreams?

00:39:45.607 --> 00:39:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Well, essentially,
recording your dreams

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.340 align:middle line:84%
is-- and we call
it a dream diary--

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's a diary of your
experiences in the dream world.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And I like to think of
it almost as like more

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.590 align:middle line:90%
of a diary of an explorer.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:04.610 align:middle line:84%
When Lewis and Clark
explored America,

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.040 align:middle line:84%
they took very detailed
notes of everything,

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.998 align:middle line:90%
so that they could compile it.

00:40:08.998 --> 00:40:10.040 align:middle line:90%
They could learn from it.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:84%
They could see how
things differed.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.653 align:middle line:84%
And we can do the same
thing with our dreams.

00:40:14.653 --> 00:40:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's like a recurring
dream, where like, oh,

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I have the same dream
every single night,

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.340 align:middle line:84%
there's probably
something to that.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Or it's a bunch of different
dreams, but in every dream,

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:84%
there's the same
dream character.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, oh, this
person keeps showing up.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should go
chat with them.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're
there for a reason.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.560 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's just--

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.470 align:middle line:84%
it's essentially be
the documentation

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:42.400 align:middle line:84%
of what we experienced
in the dream,

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.610 align:middle line:84%
almost like when the doctor
gives you your physical.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.250 align:middle line:84%
They have to take
notes and stuff.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're taking the notes
partly because when you go in

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.890 align:middle line:84%
for the next checkup, they
want to be able to reference

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.030 align:middle line:90%
the first one.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So we can do the very
same thing with our dreams

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:01.325 align:middle line:84%
and essentially, keep
track of our dream health.

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And you do start seeing
themes emerging and learning

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.260 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, definitely.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or a problem
even deepening, right,

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.730 align:middle line:84%
if the nightmares
are increasing.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And so, what do you
think is happening?

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.600 align:middle line:90%
We have the dream world.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And then when people
take psychotropic drugs,

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.370 align:middle line:84%
right, what do you
think is emerging

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:20.930 align:middle line:84%
from that world versus
the dream world?

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a place
they kind of merge?

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: I would say
there is some overlap,

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:34.150 align:middle line:84%
at least in the overlap
of how we feel about it.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So saying we're going
to a specific realm,

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
the dream realm has

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:43.480 align:middle line:90%
overlapped with the LSD realm.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that we come
out of these experiences

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:54.190 align:middle line:84%
usually with more
knowledge, with new insight.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:42:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I think just the act
of experiencing something

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.110 align:middle line:84%
different than what we normally
are being programmed at

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.560 align:middle line:90%
is very beneficial.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
have someone watch

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, Jared was telling
me now I got to do LSD.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Because drugs and
hallucinatory experiences--

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and I make no judgment
of that-- but also,

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to remind people,
every single night, you

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.050 align:middle line:90%
can experience that.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: 100% healthy.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:29.900 align:middle line:84%
No worry of arrest, or overdose,
or anything of that nature.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like your dreams are--

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:84%
some of it's probably more
powerful than a lot of drugs.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Because not only is
it personal, it's

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:42.100 align:middle line:90%
like this very vivid experience.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very nicely said.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.780 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about MIT.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Now MIT has been diving
into dream work, right?

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.490 align:middle line:90%
They have their own dream lab.

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:55.763 align:middle line:84%
So MIT, they also
call it Dream Labs.

00:42:55.763 --> 00:42:56.680 align:middle line:90%
There's no connection.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.090 align:middle line:90%
I have no interaction with them.

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:02.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm just like an
interested party,

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.900 align:middle line:84%
keeping an eye to
what they're doing.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.560 align:middle line:10%
And they're doing this sort
of engineering dreams project

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.770 align:middle line:10%
that has a bunch of
different components,

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:18.430 align:middle line:10%
essentially to try to understand
dreams and, by way of that,

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.570 align:middle line:10%
understand the mind.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they've been creating
these different devices

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:30.560 align:middle line:84%
to help record dreams,
to help you become lucid,

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.620 align:middle line:84%
to help you understand
what's going on.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
part of their goal

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.090 align:middle line:84%
is to make the
devices affordable,

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:43.360 align:middle line:84%
so that they can send it
around and get that data.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing
with study and sleep,

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.220 align:middle line:84%
it can be very difficult
and very costly.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.487 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to
get someone into a lab,

00:43:50.487 --> 00:43:52.570 align:middle line:84%
a lot of expensive equipment
that you're hooked up

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:55.570 align:middle line:84%
to, and then also sometimes,
with all that stimulus,

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:57.910 align:middle line:90%
it's difficult to fall asleep.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And so they're trying to find
practical ways to understand

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:90%
what's going on during dreams.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:15.865 align:middle line:84%
And one of the interesting
devices they're working on is--

00:44:15.865 --> 00:44:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I might be mispronouncing it,
but I think it's called Dormio.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's this glove
that you wear.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's supposed to
mimic this, I guess,

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.980 align:middle line:84%
activity that famous people
have done throughout history,

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:35.410 align:middle line:84%
such as like Dalí, and
Tesla, and Edgar Allan Poe,

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:37.820 align:middle line:84%
where they would hold a steel
ball as they were falling

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:38.620 align:middle line:90%
asleep.

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And before they
actually fell asleep

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:43.750 align:middle line:84%
during the hypnagogic stage,
where they're semi-lucid,

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.750 align:middle line:84%
they see some stuff, but
they're still kind of awake.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:49.990 align:middle line:84%
They would use that time period
to essentially play around

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:52.840 align:middle line:84%
with their imagination
and get inspiration.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.665 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, you dip
into the unconscious.

00:44:55.665 --> 00:44:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And you fall asleep,
and you forget it.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:59.455 align:middle line:84%
So what they would
do is hold the ball.

00:44:59.455 --> 00:45:01.330 align:middle line:84%
When they fell asleep,
they dropped the ball.

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.622 align:middle line:84%
The clang would wake them
up, and they could record it.

00:45:03.622 --> 00:45:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Now what MIT's doing
is they're trying

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:09.760 align:middle line:84%
to mimic that experience
of basically using

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.695 align:middle line:84%
your hand, your
bio signals, to--

00:45:12.695 --> 00:45:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're drifting
off, it'll signal you?

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.810 align:middle line:84%
If it's drifting off,
it will signal you

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.280 align:middle line:90%
in a variety of ways.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they
have another robot.

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Being MIT, they probably
have plenty of robots around.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm going to
ask about that in a moment, too.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:30.268 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And the robot would
say a word or something.

00:45:30.268 --> 00:45:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're also
trying to experiment

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:33.790 align:middle line:84%
that what the robot
says, does that

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:37.240 align:middle line:84%
have an impact on the
visuals that you're seeing

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.863 align:middle line:90%
during this hypnagogic stage?

00:45:39.863 --> 00:45:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.860 align:middle line:90%
And two things here.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:46.930 align:middle line:84%
First, when I was
researching and looking

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:49.780 align:middle line:84%
at some of your notes about
that, I thought, wait a minute.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.660 align:middle line:84%
But MIT is hugely vested
in artificial intelligence.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So now, what is
the potential there

00:45:56.710 --> 00:46:01.488 align:middle line:84%
to be able to teach
people to control dreams?

00:46:01.488 --> 00:46:03.905 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
that word in a moment, which

00:46:03.905 --> 00:46:05.863 align:middle line:84%
is not a word that you
like, but it's something

00:46:05.863 --> 00:46:08.140 align:middle line:90%
that they call kind of promise.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:12.220 align:middle line:84%
What is the potential
interface between AI and MIT

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.960 align:middle line:84%
being involved in
these controlled dream

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.640 align:middle line:90%
states and such?

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Well, and this is just
me kind of taking a stab at it.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I'm just asking
you to take a stab at it.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.438 align:middle line:90%
Because we don't know.

00:46:22.438 --> 00:46:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to ask
that question anyway.

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:25.840 align:middle line:90%
It just popped up.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: But to me, even the
word artificial intelligence,

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:38.170 align:middle line:84%
it's trying to essentially mimic
our intelligence or our brain.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And as we've discussed,
and as everyone

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:44.350 align:middle line:84%
who basically has had a dream
knows, part of having a brain

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:45.940 align:middle line:90%
is having dreams.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it would make sense
that to better understand

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.770 align:middle line:84%
the brain by way of
dreams, we can better

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:59.120 align:middle line:84%
understand how to implement
human intelligence into--

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.040 align:middle line:90%
artificially.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes some sense.

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:02.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it can start--

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.355 align:middle line:84%
not just mapping your daylight
hours, and your proclivities,

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and so forth that
they've already

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:09.520 align:middle line:84%
been analyzing for a
long time, but start

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.120 align:middle line:84%
mapping the super conscious and
subconscious of the human being

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.360 align:middle line:84%
as well in creating
artificial intelligence.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And even there are
famous sci-fi stories

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.750 align:middle line:84%
of robots, artificial
intelligence,

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.430 align:middle line:84%
having dreams, what
does that mean.

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:30.460 align:middle line:90%
What's the famous story--

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.070 align:middle line:90%
"Do Androids Dream of Sheep?"

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:37.180 align:middle line:84%
I forget the-- it's a Philip
K. Dick book-- but basically,

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:42.330 align:middle line:84%
hinting at the combination
of dreams and AI.

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:43.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:43.505 --> 00:47:44.630 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of interesting.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I just find-- because
I'm a little wary of some

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.720 align:middle line:90%
of the potential uses for AI.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.420 align:middle line:84%
We all know that there will be
very useful good uses for it.

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.040 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
when we're talking

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.620 align:middle line:84%
about other realms
and such, I really

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.840 align:middle line:84%
am a little bit
wary of how AI can

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:04.720 align:middle line:84%
be used to thwart humanity's own
creativity, and individuation,

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.453 align:middle line:90%
and individuality, and so forth.

00:48:06.453 --> 00:48:07.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just wondering
what happens

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:10.330 align:middle line:84%
when MIT gets into
our subconscious

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and super conscious,
and they're developing

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:16.190 align:middle line:84%
the primary developers
in AI, the world of AI.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
concept for sure.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things, as you have

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.640 align:middle line:84%
said, that they kind of promise
to help you, the dreamer, who's

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.220 align:middle line:84%
experimenting and working
with their technology,

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.530 align:middle line:90%
to control your dreams.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And you say that's
not really a word

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.350 align:middle line:90%
you like associated with dreams.

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Because I think--

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:40.353 align:middle line:84%
I understand why we are
attracted to the word control.

00:48:40.353 --> 00:48:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And we often
describe lucid dreams

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:44.200 align:middle line:90%
as controlling your dreams.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.040 align:middle line:84%
We have so little
control in this world

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.730 align:middle line:84%
to exhibit complete
control in the dream world.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It sounds amazing.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:55.240 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of it is,
is that we don't really

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.250 align:middle line:90%
exhibit complete control.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes even in a dream--
and it can be a very profound

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:02.760 align:middle line:90%
and interesting dream--

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.900 align:middle line:90%
you might not have any control.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:08.090 align:middle line:84%
We might choose even to
give up control in a dream.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the
word control can

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.760 align:middle line:90%
be damaging for two reasons.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:17.860 align:middle line:84%
One is that it's
setting this idea

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.070 align:middle line:84%
that you have complete control
over your consciousness

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.050 align:middle line:90%
and your subconsciousness.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:24.228 align:middle line:90%
And we don't.

00:49:24.228 --> 00:49:25.270 align:middle line:90%
There's so much going on.

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:27.550 align:middle line:84%
The brain is the most complex
thing in the universe.

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:30.400 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to have
complete control over it?

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.300 align:middle line:90%
We can understand it.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.470 align:middle line:90%
We can explore it.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But exploring isn't
about exhibiting control.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And then the second thing is,
it sets up false expectations

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:41.760 align:middle line:84%
for those learning
how to lucid dream.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So someone might actually
get lucid and have difficulty

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.173 align:middle line:90%
manipulating the dream.

00:49:46.173 --> 00:49:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll think they're
a failure because like, oh,

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:49.720 align:middle line:90%
I was never lucid.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I couldn't
control, I couldn't change,

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:52.960 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't fly.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.620 align:middle line:84%
But a lucid dream is just
having that awareness.

00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:59.770 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you have that
awareness, you're lucid.

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you can start
working with the dream

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.878 align:middle line:90%
and trying to figure out stuff.

00:50:03.878 --> 00:50:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But to go in and think
you're lucid only when you

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:09.155 align:middle line:90%
have control is, it's hurtful.

00:50:09.155 --> 00:50:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So why are they--

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:14.230 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess that's just
kind of common draw for people

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:16.427 align:middle line:84%
that they would like to
control their dreamscape

00:50:16.427 --> 00:50:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and be a superhero
in their own dream.

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's kind
of the selling point.

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
component of it.

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:26.580 align:middle line:84%
But I also give MIT some
benefit of the doubt

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:29.200 align:middle line:90%
in that they're scientists.

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.870 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
figure out stuff.

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And what they're trying to
do is actually get control.

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And because if to run
the type of experiments,

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:42.790 align:middle line:84%
it has to be in a system where
you are exhibiting control.

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.790 align:middle line:84%
If there's too many
variables, well, then, you

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:50.500 align:middle line:84%
can't confidently say that
this data means specifically

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.510 align:middle line:84%
this, unless you
were able to control

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:56.000 align:middle line:90%
all the components around it.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying
to go after control.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.658 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:51:00.658 --> 00:51:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Because what they're
doing is they're

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.500 align:middle line:84%
creating tools
that will hopefully

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.020 align:middle line:90%
allow us to know more.

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And any form of exploration
has benefited from science,

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:14.900 align:middle line:90%
whether it be space or maritime.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So to think that lucid
dreaming can benefit from--

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This kind of
serious investigation

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.130 align:middle line:90%
through technology.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:26.712 align:middle line:84%
And the technology
requires having control

00:51:26.712 --> 00:51:27.670 align:middle line:90%
over what you're doing.

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:31.812 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good thing
and a bad thing.

00:51:31.812 --> 00:51:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Double edged
sword on that one.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.380 align:middle line:90%
There are a couple of others--

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:36.700 align:middle line:90%
this is technology coming up.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:38.690 align:middle line:90%
One you say is called COCOON.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:45.260 align:middle line:10%
And I think COCOON, that's
part of their engineering dream

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.060 align:middle line:10%
thing.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think COCOON is like the
sort of all-encompassing setup

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:56.260 align:middle line:84%
that they have to bring
in the different devices.

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.960 align:middle line:90%
So different devices will--

00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:03.200 align:middle line:84%
they have a device that actually
uses almost like aroma therapy,

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.930 align:middle line:90%
give a sense of smell out.

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I think they call it essence.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:09.642 align:middle line:84%
And using, essentially,
the power of scent--

00:52:09.642 --> 00:52:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, our
most primitive sense.

00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Totally,
and to see how

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that can influence dreams,
as well as other sensors

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:18.040 align:middle line:90%
and recording devices.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
would be interesting

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.400 align:middle line:84%
because that would engage
directly with the subconscious.

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, interesting.

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And another one you say is
called Maska, a flexible sleep

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.780 align:middle line:90%
mask for REM detection.

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we've seen plenty
of lucid dreaming masks

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:32.500 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And usually, the
ones that I've seen

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.950 align:middle line:84%
detect dreams in
one of two ways.

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:40.120 align:middle line:84%
It will either be on
a timer, basically

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.120 align:middle line:84%
trying to catch that period
of REM, where you dream.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.425 align:middle line:84%
Or it will be monitoring
your brain signal

00:52:45.425 --> 00:52:46.300 align:middle line:90%
to try and find the--

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.900 align:middle line:84%
alert you when you're
in that REM stage

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.610 align:middle line:90%
based off of brain signals.

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:55.450 align:middle line:84%
What this mask is doing is it's
looking for just the rapid eye

00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:59.188 align:middle line:84%
movement, the sensing of
movement of your eyes.

00:52:59.188 --> 00:53:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that, actually,

00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate about that--
it's not just the technology--

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:06.940 align:middle line:84%
is that they have
a goal of making--

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.860 align:middle line:84%
it's even in the
description, like flexible.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
study dreams and sleep,

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.930 align:middle line:84%
you have to get people to dream
and sleep as they normally

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:18.730 align:middle line:90%
would.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:21.370 align:middle line:84%
If you're wearing
all this device,

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:23.230 align:middle line:84%
you might have a
terrible night's sleep.

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:24.610 align:middle line:90%
And that, to me, is not--

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's going to
skew your dream quality.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Exactly.

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.310 align:middle line:84%
It will skew the dream quality
and the data from the--

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:33.190 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's just--

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:36.720 align:middle line:84%
more than anything,
I appreciate that MIT

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.250 align:middle line:84%
is taking the time
and the resources,

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists working on
this, to really investigate

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:45.500 align:middle line:84%
this from a scientific
point of view.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, I can see that.

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The other was my own little
kind of question mark

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.270 align:middle line:90%
on that whole thing.

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Because they're so heavily
invested in the other as well.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.000 align:middle line:84%
So give us a couple-- we
have a few minutes left.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you give us just a
few of the top things we can do

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to start entering-- simple,
that anybody can do--

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:06.720 align:middle line:84%
to start entering into
a lucid dream state?

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Sure.

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where it begins.

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:10.672 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And actually,
I have two sets of tips--

00:54:10.672 --> 00:54:12.820 align:middle line:84%
one just for those
who are starting out,

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.838 align:middle line:84%
and those who lucid
dream all the time.

00:54:14.838 --> 00:54:16.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's start
with the beginner stuff.

00:54:16.755 --> 00:54:17.588 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: All right.

00:54:17.588 --> 00:54:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So for the beginners,
I would say,

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:22.120 align:middle line:90%
start keeping a dream journal.

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:25.210 align:middle line:84%
I, unfortunately, am not
like a natural lucid dreamer.

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I stop
recording my dreams,

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:90%
my lucid dreaming dips down.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So I always have to
stay on top of it.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I have to
keep reminding myself

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that dreams are important,
despite making a livelihood out

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:37.750 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:42.070 align:middle line:84%
The dream journal, I find, is
like such a significant piece

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:90%
of my own personal dream work.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.632 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
makes sense because it

00:54:45.632 --> 00:54:48.880 align:middle line:84%
would be showing your
higher aspect of self

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.980 align:middle line:84%
that you're engaged, and
you're paying attention

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:52.230 align:middle line:90%
if you're recording it, right?

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:53.260 align:middle line:90%
And they say he's lazy.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.320 align:middle line:84%
He's not paying
attention anymore.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Totally.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
need to check in.

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:59.145 align:middle line:90%
And I would say--

00:54:59.145 --> 00:55:00.520 align:middle line:84%
because I always
hear this, well,

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.630 align:middle line:84%
how am I going to
keep a dream journal?

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:03.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't even remember my dreams.

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.540 align:middle line:84%
We just start off by recording
whatever you feel that morning,

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and even writing it
down, like, oh, I

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:13.030 align:middle line:84%
want to remember my dreams, and
start to essentially convince

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:15.230 align:middle line:84%
your mind that this is
something important to you.

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
you want to engage with.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.330 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:22.355 align:middle line:84%
So what about the
intention before you

00:55:22.355 --> 00:55:23.230 align:middle line:90%
go to sleep at night?

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you need any particular
intention for that?

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And so usually for someone
starting out who just wants,

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:30.770 align:middle line:84%
like, all right, just
tell me what I need to do.

00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:33.580 align:middle line:84%
It's usually two ends--
dream journal and intention.

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And intention's also
knowing you have the ability

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:42.220 align:middle line:84%
to lucid dream, as well as, as
you're falling asleep, saying,

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.540 align:middle line:90%
I will have a lucid dream.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.582 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're trying to
just remember your dreams,

00:55:45.582 --> 00:55:47.290 align:middle line:90%
I will remember my dreams.

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's all just
funneling into this idea

00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:54.100 align:middle line:84%
that we want to convince
our brain of what's

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.530 align:middle line:90%
important to us.

00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And dream journaling
is doing that

00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:00.710 align:middle line:90%
from the post of the dream.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the intentions of doing
that are from the pre-world

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:04.010 align:middle line:90%
of the dream.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes total sense.

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So we just have a
minute or so left.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:10.210 align:middle line:84%
What is something that's really
getting your jets going right

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:13.960 align:middle line:84%
now about the whole field
of dreaming, besides the MIT

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.210 align:middle line:90%
experiments and such?

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: I think that
just, that it's growing.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
something I care about.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of other
dreaming teachers and writers

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.080 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel a
sense of competition.

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all going
after the same thing.

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel that the more
people on the planet thinking

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:41.320 align:middle line:84%
about their dreams, thinking
about their inner lives,

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and that in relationship to the
external world that they're in,

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:49.330 align:middle line:84%
the better the world can grow,
and the stronger communities

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:51.880 align:middle line:84%
can become, the stronger
our family units,

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.950 align:middle line:90%
our relationships.

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:56.150 align:middle line:84%
The more dream work we
do, I think the better.

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:58.785 align:middle line:10%
And so it makes me
enthusiastic to see

00:56:58.785 --> 00:57:00.702 align:middle line:10%
it coming up more and
more, and essentially,

00:57:00.702 --> 00:57:01.577 align:middle line:10%
the importance of it.

00:57:01.577 --> 00:57:02.869 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:57:02.869 --> 00:57:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And maybe one day, maybe as
a result of this interview,

00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:08.860 align:middle line:84%
some dreamer out there
watching this show can tell me

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.510 align:middle line:90%
if they, too, have dreams of--

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I think I told you last time--
those crazy little animals

00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:16.840 align:middle line:84%
that I dream about that have
like a pig-dog with a carpet

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.840 align:middle line:90%
around, wrapped around.

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.980 align:middle line:84%
What these hybrid,
crazy, little animals

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.410 align:middle line:84%
are all about, because I hadn't
met anybody that's told me

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:25.900 align:middle line:84%
about these crazy little
animals that are part

00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.887 align:middle line:84%
this, part that, part
from somewhere else.

00:57:27.887 --> 00:57:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to know if anybody
else is having those dreams,

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.995 align:middle line:90%
too, if they can figure it out.

00:57:31.995 --> 00:57:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Hopefully, in
the theme of dream sharing,

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.250 align:middle line:90%
someone will reach out.

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There we go.

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's hope.

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.868 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
more important dreams,

00:57:37.868 --> 00:57:39.280 align:middle line:90%
but that's just a fun one.

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.517 align:middle line:90%
So Jared, thank you so much.

00:57:40.517 --> 00:57:41.600 align:middle line:90%
It was a fun conversation.

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:43.355 align:middle line:84%
I think we both had a couple
revelations here today.

00:57:43.355 --> 00:57:43.640 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: I think so.

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me back on.

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:46.250 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, Jared's
book is "A Field Guide

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:49.523 align:middle line:90%
to Lucid Dreaming."

00:57:49.523 --> 00:57:51.190 align:middle line:10%
If you haven't seen
our first interview,

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:53.923 align:middle line:10%
you might also want to watch
that in the Gaia archives.

00:57:53.923 --> 00:57:55.840 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.550 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."
