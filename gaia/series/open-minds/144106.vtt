00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.005 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many of
you have seen Gaia's Sean

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:31.760 align:middle line:10%
Stone hosting the show Buzzsaw.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:10%
We thought you might want to get
a closer glimpse into his life

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:10%
and his viewpoints.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:90%
So here's Sean.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:84%
We had a blast when
we were doing it

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:90%
the other way around last time.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:90%
At least I did.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.522 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I just really like--

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:10%
I just kind of like the
lightness of your being

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:10%
that is combined with, at the
same time, really reflective,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle line:10%
kind of deep intelligence.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think you bring a
wonderful combination that way.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN STONE: Yeah, there was
a great quote a friend of mine

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:90%
told me in high school.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.359 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, on the
surface, you seem superficial.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
But once you get to know
you, you're really deep.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.672 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You said,
I'll take it, right?

00:01:06.672 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.579 align:middle line:84%
And so in your life, you
know, a lot of people

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:84%
obviously are very
curious about you,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:84%
because they have been aware
of or a fan of your dad's work

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:90%
for so many years.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And yet, this legacy continues.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So I really want to
find out essentially

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
where metaphysics
started entering

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:84%
your viewpoint in life, because
you were exposed to so much

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.940 align:middle line:90%
as a child.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.356 align:middle line:84%
And then after
that, I want to get

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
into how some of the projects
your dad was working on

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:84%
were affecting you as a little
kid, watching all of this.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah, sure.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So metaphysics-- I
mean, it's interesting,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes you hear
stories of people who grew up

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.090 align:middle line:84%
at four or five, six, or
somewhere in that age range,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and having UFO
encounters, for example.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:84%
They have memories of
seeing alien beings

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.200 align:middle line:90%
or imaginary friends, right?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Things like this.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And in reflecting
on my childhood,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:90%
I always said, it's strange.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall anything in that
vein that was supernatural,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:90%
that was far out.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:90%
It was a very ordinary--

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:84%
as I could imagine--
ordinary childhood.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Protected, being very close
to my mother, having friends.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But there was, I guess, at
five, four or five years old,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:90%
I did have some--

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I remember dreams and thoughts
that were very metaphysical,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:90%
you could say.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Basically--

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Share.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: --imagining--
well, just imagining, well,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
you're told about
Heaven as a child.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.249 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what people think.

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I thought,
well, wait a minute.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.456 align:middle line:84%
Heaven is a place
where you can go

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and you can do everything
you want, all day, everyday.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.570 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a child.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, here, I can go
to Heaven and it's amazing.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
It's light, and
every day you play,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and you get to play and play,
and play, and play, and play,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:90%
and play.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
imagine infinity.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And you start to delve into
this concept of infinity.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And wait a minute.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
If you can just do whatever
you want every day,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%
that becomes a type of torture.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a--

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's very
astute for a five-year-old.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.277 align:middle line:84%
And this notion
of, wait a minute.

00:03:02.277 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
that's Heaven anymore,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.750 align:middle line:84%
because you're
getting whatever you

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.180 align:middle line:90%
want all the time, immediately.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.322 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
in a sense, I then

00:03:11.322 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:84%
started saying, well,
maybe that's not reality.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that Heaven
is not a real one,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
because it becomes
like a torture.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other extreme,
if you say that at death,

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
there's only darkness
and black night,

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and you just imagined
sort of this--

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Worms.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Well, no.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:90%
Just this tomb of darkness.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.020 align:middle line:90%
But like nothing.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Not even worms.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Just sensory deprivation.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty frightening too.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So from there, you start
to delve into these other--

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:90%
those are two extremes.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And you start to delve
into other aspects of what

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:90%
actually does happen.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.779 align:middle line:84%
And then I went with my father
to India at 10 years old,

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and he taught me
about the third eye.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.495 align:middle line:84%
He taught me about Buddhism
and concepts of reincarnation.

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that actually
probably makes more sense

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to me, the idea that we're
on this soul's journey,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and each lifetime is lived so
that we can basically acquire

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:90%
wisdom and understanding.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
there's some teleology

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
as far as our journey of
where we're aiming to go,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.929 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know
how many lifetimes

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:90%
it'll take to get there.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.825 align:middle line:84%
And the lifetimes can
take us beyond this world,

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to other worlds.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So then you get into this
concept obviously of aliens,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and you start to read
books like, in my case,

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:84%
David Icke and Jim Marrs
and others and saying, OK.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.832 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's an alien reality
that existed that actually not

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
only seeded mankind,
the Zecharia Sitchin

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
interpretation of the
Sumerian accounts, obviously,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:90%
but there are others.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And they seeded mankind.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And then if there
are aliens that

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:84%
have been here since the past,
maybe they're still here.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And maybe our future
is an alien future.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So I would say this has been my
process, basically, of evolving

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:90%
in the metaphysical direction.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very organic,
and also, it was very reflective

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:90%
for someone that young.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.710 align:middle line:84%
When did you start tapping
into the work of people

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:90%
like David Icke, for example?

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Yeah, I mean, I came
about when I was 17, actually.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I was at one of those
magical bookshops, I think.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a few of them around
in places like LA and New York.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And so in LA, I went to
one of the bookshops,

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and I was digging through
the conspiracy section.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about the
other conspiracy angle,

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:84%
because obviously, I knew
about conspiracies from--

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're going to
talk about that in just a sec.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.159 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Yeah, the
historical perspective.

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But you know, being in a
bookshop and reading conspiracy

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:84%
books, and "The Biggest
Secret" popped out to me.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.475 align:middle line:84%
I think was "The
Biggest Secret."

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was just sort of
gigantic in its scope.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
interested about history.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it was
like a gateway drug.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:90%
It opened the door to this idea.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:90%
What are Masons?

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:90%
What are Templars?

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
What is this Hermetic
Gnostic tradition

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:84%
that we see in art and
certain depict-- basically,

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:84%
certain secret society
portrayals of history

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:84%
that is the alternative
path, basically,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
if you look deeper
beneath the surface.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.474 align:middle line:90%
And then he introduced me to--

00:05:55.474 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
his book introduced
me to Sitchin,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
and I read "The 12th
Planet" and that series.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So really came through
17, 18, that time period.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Going off to college, I became
more aware, I would say,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:84%
of these concepts of
multidimensionality.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.784 align:middle line:84%
But again, I never
experienced it.

00:06:12.784 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:84%
This was all from an
intellectual perspective,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.680 align:middle line:84%
someone who was trying
to understand the world

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
purely as an
intellectual scholar,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:84%
or someone who's going
to-- at that time,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:90%
I was going to Princeton.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.643 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to study history.

00:06:23.643 --> 00:06:27.615 align:middle line:84%
I was very keen on
scholarship and reading

00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:30.645 align:middle line:84%
and having citations
and sources and not--

00:06:30.645 --> 00:06:32.770 align:middle line:84%
you can speculate and
obviously have fun with that,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
but when it comes to
delivering a paper,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
you have to be balanced and
grounded in what can be proven.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So that was my journey up
till the post-college era.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did it create
a little bit of a split

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:84%
in at least your
desire and where

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:84%
you wanted to go in
your mind to be exposed

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
to all the conspiracy and
the notion of other worlds,

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:84%
ETs and other developing
civilizations here,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and then have to be incredibly
academic at the same time?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.887 align:middle line:84%
Did you have fellows that you
could chat with about this?

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Not really.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was a
lonely time, I would say.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.702 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it was a hard thing.

00:07:06.702 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
isolating experience,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
being in high
school and college.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Because on one hand,
like you said, I was,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
A, I was interested
by these things

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:90%
that were extradimensional.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.744 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I was
still grounded in my studies,

00:07:22.744 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and I was also-- you know,
it's an internal journey.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a very lonely journey.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
you have to seal off

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:90%
one part from the other.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Correct.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.086 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think, what
happened, what did happen.

00:07:31.086 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember at
13, actually, about 13 I

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:84%
was in Vietnam with my father,
and we were going there,

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
him as a veteran
of the Vietnam War.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:84%
He'd been there before many
times, but he took me there.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And we basically relived
this very beautiful journey

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
through from the tunnels of Cu
Chi, Saigon, Hanoi, Da Nang,

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:90%
all these different places.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And he was haunted by it, but
he was exploring it with me

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.084 align:middle line:90%
and sharing the country with me.

00:07:58.084 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
there and looking

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:84%
at the museum and
the war museum,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.941 align:middle line:84%
and reflecting on the
millions of Vietnamese that

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:84%
had been killed and
traumatized by this war,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I started downloading
really interesting imagery

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:90%
of a new world order, basically.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.944 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
the concept was.

00:08:12.944 --> 00:08:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if
I'd heard the term.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, I
was seeing this map--

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:84%
sorry, the flag of the
United States transforming,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.175 align:middle line:84%
and basically, a globe
was replacing the stars.

00:08:23.175 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:84%
It was basically
saying, there's a story

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:84%
being downloaded about
how the world was going

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:90%
to become organized under one--

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That certainly
was where it was fomented.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:84%
Vietnam War was a
big part of that.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Perhaps.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but it was weird to
download this information

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:84%
at 13 about global
governance, and the idea

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.169 align:middle line:84%
that Lucifer or some
kind of satanic figure

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
was really behind
it, and they were

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.570 align:middle line:84%
going to use the pretense
of de-disarming everyone,

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:84%
bringing everyone--
de-nuclearization as a process,

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.769 align:middle line:84%
It's ultimately put the
power into one hand, which

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:90%
is ultimately the devil's hand.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And the devil is going to use
it to destroy America first,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.819 align:middle line:90%
and then the whole planet.

00:08:57.819 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And this was just a story that
downloaded to me at that time.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.662 align:middle line:90%
It was very visual.

00:09:01.662 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a script of it.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.057 align:middle line:84%
But it was weird, because I
had not heard this concept--

00:09:05.057 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how old were
you again at that time?

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.545 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: 13.

00:09:07.545 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 13.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Right, yeah.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So your mind was already
beginning to put pieces

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:90%
together in original ways.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.036 align:middle line:84%
Were you able to always
talk with your-- well, both

00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:84%
your mother and father,
were you able to talk

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.560 align:middle line:84%
over these various
concepts with them?

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Were they open to all of the
things that you were exploring?

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I mean, you know,
my father is someone who is

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:90%
actually very--

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I would say rational
and materialistic

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
in terms of his
thinking about reality.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
He's someone who takes
the Buddhist perception.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And all of reality is
the mind, basically.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you believe
in ghosts, if you

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
believe in gods and devils and
all this, it's ultimately--

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:84%
it's only as true as you
believe it to be, right?

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:90%
He would take that perception.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And so when I wrote this
script, for example,

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't understand at all
the concept of the devil figure

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.480 align:middle line:84%
being a real character and
all these supernatural forces

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
that, to me, actually
make more sense

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.940 align:middle line:90%
having lived through it later.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, it was
literally just an imagination

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:90%
of a kid who's--

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.450 align:middle line:84%
frankly, I've always been
interested in sword and sandal

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.857 align:middle line:84%
fantasies, sci-fi, I
think, more than him.

00:10:17.857 --> 00:10:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And it reflects in
his work, you know?

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
He's someone who's very
much a rationalist.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
If you look at his project,
they're always biographies.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:84%
They're always rooted
in the real world.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:84%
"The Doors" may be the
most esoteric of the pieces

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
where they have a bit of
the ghosts of the Indians

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:90%
intruding into it.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.892 align:middle line:84%
But again, he would say, it's
all the mind, the mindscape.

00:10:37.892 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But didn't you say
when you were in India that he

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
was turning you on to these
other higher concepts,

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.740 align:middle line:90%
including reincarnation?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Where does that work with him?

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Because
it's just the mind.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.176 align:middle line:84%
It's the mind that carries
over from body to body.

00:10:49.176 --> 00:10:49.976 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:10:49.976 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So nothing empirical
other than just

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
whatever the thought
is able to create.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Precisely Nothing in
terms of, I would say,

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.029 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial,
esoteric domain.

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
where he would stop.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.524 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he
obviously is intrigued

00:11:05.524 --> 00:11:07.280 align:middle line:84%
with alternative
versions, concepts.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he does brilliant work
as bringing up the conspiracies

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.480 align:middle line:90%
in the rational world.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:90%
But you're taking that further.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.185 align:middle line:90%
And what about your mother?

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:90%
How is she wired in terms of--

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: She's someone
who believes in angels.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:24.444 align:middle line:84%
She believes very much
in these principles.

00:11:24.444 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
you know, she's

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.720 align:middle line:84%
not someone who
practices religion.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.060 align:middle line:90%
You know, she was born Catholic.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Really more of a Protestant.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But then, I mean,
basically lapsed

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.380 align:middle line:84%
because the Catholic
church, as we

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
know, the way that
they'd school you,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.734 align:middle line:84%
the nurses would
whip them, basically.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:84%
They'd crack their
knuckles with rulers.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.172 align:middle line:90%
They were very abysmally cruel.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So she ran away from
the Catholic church,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:90%
went to the Protestant side.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.544 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, she took
me to the Self-Realization

00:11:52.544 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Fellowship, you know,
Yogananda's thing.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.816 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And that was a
really important thing

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
in my upbringing, was
actually to worship and study

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.174 align:middle line:90%
from all texts.

00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, that was
the concept was

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:84%
you go to the
Self-Realization Fellowship

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and you would hear a
sermon, and it could

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:90%
be quoting from the Quran.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:90%
It could be from The Vedas.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:84%
It could be from
Buddhist teachings,

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
it could be Daoist,
Christian, Jewish.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
You basically
honored the one god,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
which all the fates
are basically derived

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:90%
from a one-source concept.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and now,
if you go from there,

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really matter which
of those traditions you follow.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.240 align:middle line:84%
They'll all go into the
notion of dark realms.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Humans interfacing with the
great challenge of dark realms.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And that gets us to the
area of multidimensionality,

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and this feeling
that you've always

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.550 align:middle line:84%
had that there's
something watching,

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and maybe perhaps
more than watching.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think this would be a
good time to get into that.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
In your perception,
having thought

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:84%
this over most of your
lifetime, what do you

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
think it is that's
interfacing with humanity

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:90%
or watching or interfering?

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And what do you feel
the purpose of it is?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.989 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Hmm.

00:13:03.989 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, it depends if I'm--

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Take your time.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.533 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: --in a good
mood or in a dark mood.

00:13:07.533 --> 00:13:08.502 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:08.502 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Let me set it up this way.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
It should be known that
all those traditions also

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:84%
have the higher realms
intersecting with this plane

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:90%
that human beings live on.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
We have the lower
and the higher.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Precisely.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is a
truth to the idea

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:90%
that it's about perception.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.302 align:middle line:84%
How do we want to
perceive things?

00:13:29.302 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I've had initiation
journeys where I recognized

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.040 align:middle line:84%
the devils were actually
just the angels' wings,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and basically they were
wearing masks to scare people,

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
essentially, to
test you, to see,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
are you courageous enough to
face those demons, a darkness,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:90%
and not be afraid?

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
If you are afraid, they
have power over you.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.754 align:middle line:84%
They will get you into
all kinds of traps.

00:13:50.754 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way I see it.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I see it like a soul journey,
where basically, your soul

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:90%
is being tested.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Where does it stand?

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Does it want to basically bow
down to the rulers, the kings,

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:90%
the people with money that--

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.942 align:middle line:90%
the illusion of power?

00:14:05.942 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Those demons, do you
want to bow to them?

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to make
deals with them

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:84%
to increase your own power
within this physical realm?

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
it's all transitory.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.930 align:middle line:84%
It's all illusion in that
sense that it won't last.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So is it really worth
trading our soul energy,

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:84%
that initial light,
spark that comes

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:84%
from the primordial
source, is it worth

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
trading this goal that is
within us already innately

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
for some fool's gold that
is offered along the way?

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And so many people are
willing to basically trade

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.719 align:middle line:84%
what is most valuable, what is
the thing that they actually

00:14:39.719 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:84%
want most, which is to
actually return to source,

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
which is actually to
shed light and commune

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
with other beings in a pure
sense, in a loving sense.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're willing to trade
that for a temporary moment

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:90%
of satisfaction, comfort.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, it's a difficult,
tremendously difficult journey.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't
answer for everyone

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and tell them, you know,
what they need to do,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately,
it's their own course.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.486 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have to go through
the hells to experience that.

00:15:06.486 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:84%
That's what you
were meant to do.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So I really can't condemn
people for being, to my mind,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:90%
wicked or cruel or mean or evil.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:90%
It's their own path.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And all I can do is recognize
maybe where they went wrong

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and where I would want
to basically not follow

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:90%
that same trajectory.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So on a larger level,
do you believe that the darker

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.440 align:middle line:90%
realms--

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
we would call them darker
realms-- the challenging realms

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and the lighter realms or
those that choose to or assist

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.650 align:middle line:84%
in upliftment are
of the same source,

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and are simply playing
out their own roles

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
here in terms of their
interface with humanity?

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes, of course.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:84%
We know that if there is a
primordial light that casts out

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and then basically continues to
shine throughout the universe,

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:84%
but then it also slows
into material forms, right?

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Matter itself is a different
expression of that same energy.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's slowed down energy.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:84%
It's basically-- it's
light in slow motion.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And when that matter
forms, it casts the shadow.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So the shadow is a necessary
consequence of the light,

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:84%
like the Zorastrians
would put it, right?

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to
be the dark and the light,

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and that you have to respect
and honor that, and know,

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I would say, even in Kabbalah
and other spiritual traditions

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.959 align:middle line:84%
to understand that there
is always a time for war,

00:16:36.959 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:90%
there's a time for peace.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a time to be severe,
there's a time to be lenient.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
We have to recognize
this balance.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's a difficult
thing, right?

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Because not everybody can
get to that place of wisdom,

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
that place of a King Solomon,
to understand essentially

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:56.620 align:middle line:84%
how to be just, how to rule,
how to basically wield the left

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:90%
with the right in harmony.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Most people, I would say, are
struggling with that concept

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:90%
throughout their lives.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.046 align:middle line:84%
So yes, to answer
the question, is

00:17:05.046 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
it "all a stage" like
Shakespeare said?

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.470 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I think it's all a
game, and each one of us

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:84%
playing the role that resonates
with our soul and, again,

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:90%
our journey.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.436 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
agree with that.

00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to not demonize
the lower realms,

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:90%
because they are forming--

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:84%
they're performing their own
function for their own growth.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.700 align:middle line:84%
That is the field in which
they play to learn themselves.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:90%
But to respect it.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.687 align:middle line:90%
But again, go ahead and--

00:17:30.687 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Well, they work--

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.510 align:middle line:84%
the interesting thing is that
we can feel the lower realms

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:90%
within us at any moment, right?

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.030 align:middle line:84%
The places-- there
was a time in my life

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:84%
after college when I went to
explore haunted realms, haunted

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:90%
mental hospitals, for example.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Haunted houses, places that
were very cursed by death,

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.177 align:middle line:90%
by madness.

00:17:51.177 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:90%
And you could feel the energies.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.880 align:middle line:84%
You could feel the
heaviness and the pain.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the demonic
realm lives vibrationally,

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So within your own being, if you
operate from a place of fear,

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
from a place of suffering and
self-pity and anger, hatred,

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:90%
the demonic--

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
those entities resonate
at the same vibration,

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.985 align:middle line:90%
and they'll attach.

00:18:13.985 --> 00:18:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And then it's like the
more they attach, obviously,

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:90%
the heavier you become.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:90%
They weigh you down.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:84%
You get caught into these cycles
of being within the lower realm

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.950 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of hell that
you go through, right?

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pure resonance.

00:18:28.755 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: But the goal
to me would be letting

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:90%
go of those lower frequencies.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, see it, face it,
let it go, transcend it,

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:90%
raise the vibration.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Raise yourself into a place
at least of neutrality,

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:84%
if not higher, being resonant
with joy, love, care,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.802 align:middle line:90%
consideration, respect.

00:18:47.802 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And from there,
basically in that journey

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:52.930 align:middle line:84%
of raising the vibration, those
demons either will fall away,

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.695 align:middle line:84%
or some of them
may rise with you.

00:18:54.695 --> 00:18:55.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:55.495 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
To unselect, no longer
choose to go into resonance

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.294 align:middle line:84%
with it, which is not
as easy as it sounds.

00:19:00.294 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Once your frequencies
have been lowered,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:84%
it takes a little work to start
bringing yourself back out

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.427 align:middle line:84%
of it, but it all begins
with a choice, right?

00:19:06.427 --> 00:19:07.968 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It does
begin with a choice.

00:19:07.968 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do-- what we
choose to eat, for example.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's obviously
affecting our body, right?

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And from there,
you know, what you

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:84%
choose to eat, listen to,
pay attention to, focus

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:90%
your energy on, speak.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why the traditions are
always about right intention,

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.927 align:middle line:90%
right speech, right thought.

00:19:24.927 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, right thought
before the speech.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Then right deed, right action.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So what do you feel about
essentially the state of media

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:84%
right now, where so much
darkness is being perpetuated?

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.146 align:middle line:90%
And its role in society.

00:19:38.146 --> 00:19:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Yeah, you know,
it's just-- it's sad to me

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:84%
mostly that anyone actually
believes it anymore,

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.590 align:middle line:84%
because to me, it's become
so flagrantly apparent

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:90%
that they're brainwashing us.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.609 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you can turn on
a channel, any of these news

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:84%
media channels, and
essentially, it's

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.380 align:middle line:84%
the same story running
all day, right?

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same language.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.055 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Same language,
but same story.

00:19:59.055 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing else
happening in the world.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.676 align:middle line:84%
So that should already
be an indication,

00:20:02.676 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the movies
are more and more rehashing,

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:90%
repeating the same storylines.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they're
remaking the same movie.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.130 align:middle line:84%
They're retelling
it over and over.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
It means that we're
stuck in a cycle

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:90%
that we have to break out of.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.010 align:middle line:84%
We have to step-- break out
of it by stepping away from it

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.345 align:middle line:90%
and saying, OK.

00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:24.934 align:middle line:84%
I don't choose to focus
my energy there anymore.

00:20:24.934 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:84%
I like to go back
and just watch--

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.141 align:middle line:84%
if the movies aren't
interesting, I go back

00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:90%
and watch the classics.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'll read a book.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.595 align:middle line:84%
I'll separate myself
from these things that

00:20:33.595 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
are basically just trapping
us into these games,

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.765 align:middle line:90%
because it is a labyrinth.

00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:84%
The labyrinth of the mind is
the most terrifying thing.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:84%
That was the essence
of the film I

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
did that was based on my
experiences ghost hunting.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
"Greystone Park"
was about the idea

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.607 align:middle line:84%
that this mental
hospital was a labyrinth.

00:20:49.607 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And when the characters
went in there,

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.398 align:middle line:84%
they basically went inside
the labyrinth of the mind,

00:20:53.398 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and all their fears
started to manifest.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:84%
First the shadows,
and the shadows

00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.090 align:middle line:84%
got more and more energy
and became the various ghost

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
stories that they'd heard at
the beginning now starting

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
to take form, and actually
scare them and attack them.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's ultimately our own
mind that's projecting out.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
The same with the
shadow, it's always you.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But the more you get
lost in the labyrinth,

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:84%
you forget that
it's your shadow,

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and you start to see
it as something else.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we are.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I think we're in this place
of the mind's labyrinth

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:84%
not realizing those shadows,
those fears are really just us.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And we have to either step
back, shed light on it,

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:90%
ignore it, change focus.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way to
get out of the labyrinth,

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
because the labyrinth
has no exit.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.120 align:middle line:84%
You just go deeper and deeper
the longer you walk into it.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And you just sit there,
actually sit inside of it,

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.910 align:middle line:90%
and create your own world.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the Hermetic
tradition, all is mind.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:90%
All is projected from mind.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean you don't have
love, compassion, emotions,

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.830 align:middle line:84%
companionship that take
into consideration.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:90%
But the entire stage is of mind.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And so again, having that will--
and I think a lot of people

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.350 align:middle line:84%
have lost sight of what
the word will actually

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:84%
means, and get it
confused with willful

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
versus using the right
use of will, as you say,

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.394 align:middle line:84%
to make choices that
are more clean and more

00:22:13.394 --> 00:22:14.310 align:middle line:90%
lifting your own game.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:90%
More refining in nature.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And so on that, I just
had to make this comment.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:90%
I did a show with--

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I think his name is
Michael Esposito.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrible with names.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Lovely man, but he's
in our archives.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:10%
I think it's Esposito.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:90%
And it had to do with--

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:84%
he was in the
recording industry,

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and he goes around to asylums,
especially abandoned asylums,

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:42.990 align:middle line:84%
old asylums, and he records the
beings that are living there.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:84%
With the way he's engineered
his recording technology,

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
he actually picks
up in the others

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.540 align:middle line:90%
subtle dimensions their words.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's fascinating.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
He gave me-- I mean, it's
got to be the weirdest record

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:90%
anyone possesses.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I have this record of
these ghostly recordings,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and the most popular
word is the F word.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just repeated.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So much anger is being
projected from their realm,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.025 align:middle line:84%
this entrapment, that the
F word comes up repeatedly

00:23:15.025 --> 00:23:15.825 align:middle line:90%
on his recordings.

00:23:15.825 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And what do we
know about the nature

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:90%
of language and vibration?

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.744 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know
from various studies done

00:23:21.744 --> 00:23:22.910 align:middle line:90%
by the Japanese scientists--

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.035 align:middle line:84%
I think the Russians
replicated it-- but basically,

00:23:25.035 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
some scientists have shown
that when you play frequencies

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:84%
of sound of music, the
water actually takes--

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
water molecules, they
take certain formation.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And so when it's harmonious
and beautiful, uplifting sounds

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.830 align:middle line:84%
in music, obviously,
they create the hexagon,

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.390 align:middle line:84%
which is the natural snowflake
formation of water molecules.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And what it's F words and
basically like swearing,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:90%
cursing, hatred, vitriol--

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Really ugly
formations take place.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: And what do we know?

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:90%
We are water mostly.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.505 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So what does
that mean about exactly

00:23:54.505 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:84%
the precise words, the
languages that surround us,

00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:84%
the power of vibration
through music,

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.299 align:middle line:84%
through media, all these
different sources of control

00:24:04.299 --> 00:24:06.090 align:middle line:84%
that are really
subliminal, because they're

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:90%
affecting our water structure.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:08.284 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:08.284 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And that ghostly realm
is programmed in the way

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:84%
that you understood
when you were

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.070 align:middle line:90%
putting that film together.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
It is a darkly afflicted place
of entrapment for these beings.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, Greystone
was demolished actually,

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.410 align:middle line:90%
a couple of years ago.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank God.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:90%
Let it disperse.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.789 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I hope they don't build
some real estate on top of it,

00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:84%
then we'll become
like "Poltergeist."

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: They'll
make the sequel.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It's just
"Poltergeist."

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.243 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've always,
from the time you were born,

00:24:36.243 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:90%
understood the power of film.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
that for a moment,

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to start
going into the secret society

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.321 align:middle line:84%
and other conspiracies that
you wrote your book about.

00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: So the power--
well, the power of film?

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously, this has
been inculcated into you

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.730 align:middle line:84%
on a cellular DNA
level from birth.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.363 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do you take
as the power of film?

00:24:56.363 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
What is the power
of film to you?

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Personally,
I mean, I've

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:84%
always been obsessed with
film since I saw my first one,

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.060 align:middle line:84%
you know, probably at
three years of age.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think what it
is is to take whatever

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
the condition in life is and to
blow it up to such an extreme

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.590 align:middle line:84%
that you actually have
to absorb yourself into.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like a
five-year-old at the movies.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:90%
I can't separate.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I try to say, no.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:90%
There's a boom.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:84%
There's a mic just
above this shot.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
I still can't separate
myself from it.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Because watching
that roll out tends

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.580 align:middle line:84%
to have a very deep impact
on the emotional body,

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:84%
the emotional aspect
of human beings,

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:90%
more than the intellect.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're like
this, looking into a camera

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and someone is speaking
to you into a camera,

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that much more
engages the intellect,

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.880 align:middle line:84%
but the emotions are
completely impacted and engaged

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:90%
and manipulated through film.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So you can manipulate
them wisely.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I love making
documentaries and films,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:84%
but I know that I'm
manipulating when I'm doing it.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.390 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I
choose is the music.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:84%
First thing is I know what
I want the message to be.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Next thing comes the
music that will drive

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.900 align:middle line:90%
the emotions of that message.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Then comes the color.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:08.748 align:middle line:90%
Then comes the imagery.

00:26:08.748 --> 00:26:11.360 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I put
together is a script.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's what it
is to me, is to help

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.800 align:middle line:84%
inculcate a certain
understanding into humanity.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.025 align:middle line:84%
You can choose the
message, because we

00:26:21.025 --> 00:26:22.400 align:middle line:84%
can receive it in
a different way

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:84%
through films than
anything else.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.316 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:26:26.316 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the new form of
religious experience.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:90%
It basically--

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's larger than life.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: --replaced the
religious experience

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.950 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And it is the "Wizard of
Oz," and that concept of, you

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:84%
don't see the man who's
really orchestrating it.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:84%
It's usually the
director with conjunction

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.820 align:middle line:84%
with certain producers,
and obviously

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.330 align:middle line:84%
studios having their
say in the matter.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So you don't see
their hands guiding

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.660 align:middle line:84%
the actor whose face becomes
the expression of whatever

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:84%
dreams you have, whatever
dreams, longings, fears,

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.972 align:middle line:84%
hopes are expressed
in those faces.

00:27:01.972 --> 00:27:03.430 align:middle line:84%
I think you expressed
it very well.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.856 align:middle line:84%
We know the power of film on the
unconscious mind in particular,

00:27:06.856 --> 00:27:08.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
nature of magic.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.063 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once you create
the set and setting,

00:27:10.063 --> 00:27:11.870 align:middle line:90%
you darken, you know--

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It bypasses the
intellect and conscious mind.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Exactly.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Darkened auditorium.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:90%
You focus on the screen.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Dim the light, the
candles or light.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the light
projected onto the screen

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:90%
like the shadows of a cave.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you
know, we are basically

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.010 align:middle line:90%
sharing in this experience.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:84%
It could be cathartic,
it can be frustrating,

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.120 align:middle line:90%
whatever it may be.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's basically planting--

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they say
it's preprogramming

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:90%
or predictive programming.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.260 align:middle line:84%
They're creating
certain conditions

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:84%
that they want us to ultimately
accept later on by first

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.485 align:middle line:90%
showing it to us on screen.

00:27:45.485 --> 00:27:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So hence, when 9/11 occurred,
my young cousin said,

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.870 align:middle line:90%
it's like a movie.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was about
seven years old.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He got it.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Play the same thing
over and over.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So the power of film,
obviously, we realize.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.244 align:middle line:90%
And it's a dangerous power.

00:28:03.244 --> 00:28:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one
hand, you think

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
of the theater and reading,
and it leaves a lot more

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.360 align:middle line:90%
to the imagination.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.290 align:middle line:90%
There was a social impact--

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
there's a social impact
and a social relationship

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to theater and the
stage, going back

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.316 align:middle line:84%
to the Greeks and all the way
through Shakespeare's time.

00:28:20.316 --> 00:28:21.940 align:middle line:84%
You would go, you
hear the play, and it

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.630 align:middle line:84%
was played out by a man on
a stage, and even females.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.279 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you knew
that it was a play.

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But you would hear the
words, and your mind

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.644 align:middle line:84%
would go elsewhere, and you'd
start to envision the world.

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You weren't
overwhelmed by the experience.

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah you would
envision the world.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.515 align:middle line:84%
So with reading,
you read a book,

00:28:37.515 --> 00:28:39.000 align:middle line:90%
and you envision another world.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And now because
we've become entirely

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:45.520 align:middle line:84%
visual, as far as our
recognition of the reality

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.370 align:middle line:84%
out there, that we are
easily overwhelmed.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:51.610 align:middle line:84%
We're not able to actually
bring our own imagination

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:52.711 align:middle line:90%
into play the same way.

00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
certainly that's being

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
lost more and more by the
way that media in general

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.610 align:middle line:90%
has become so graphic.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.810 align:middle line:84%
You go back and you
watch the films up

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.790 align:middle line:84%
through about the '70s,
and there was still

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:04.730 align:middle line:84%
a certain sense
of, we don't have

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:06.396 align:middle line:84%
to show the guts
coming out of somebody.

00:29:06.396 --> 00:29:09.310 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to show two
people having sex in bed

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.990 align:middle line:84%
to get the power of
their relationship.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:14.005 align:middle line:84%
You could still leave
things to the imagination.

00:29:14.005 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You could allude.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And it
wasn't to say that I'm

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:90%
in favor of censorship.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.245 align:middle line:84%
But I just think that
there's something

00:29:20.245 --> 00:29:23.730 align:middle line:90%
that's lost in our ability to--

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:90%
it's almost poetry.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.890 align:middle line:90%
There's a notion of irony in us.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.345 align:middle line:90%
We have to fill in the blanks.

00:29:28.345 --> 00:29:30.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you listen
to classical music,

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:84%
you have to have patience to
actually wait for the breath.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.550 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
everything instantaneously.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where
we are being shifted

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.260 align:middle line:84%
by the media in
general into this place

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
of instantaneous gratification
and the inability

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:84%
to actually figure things
out for ourselves or realize.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Like when you watch news,
for example, what happens

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:90%
at the edge of the frame?

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reporter
may not even be

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:90%
in the city they claim to be in.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.590 align:middle line:90%
They're really in a hotel.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.944 align:middle line:84%
They're nowhere near-- they're
nowhere near the attack.

00:29:59.944 --> 00:30:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In beds in hotels.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.246 align:middle line:90%
But it's equated how they--

00:30:03.246 --> 00:30:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and once you understand-- so
I grew up learning the power

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.860 align:middle line:84%
of film, as you understood
from making a documentary,

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.310 align:middle line:84%
when you understand everything
is about how you frame,

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.504 align:middle line:84%
where you make the
cut, how you use--

00:30:14.504 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
lays an impression.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.961 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And next thing
you know-- exactly.

00:30:17.961 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:84%
You are influencing and
manipulating people.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's an inevitable
consequence of being a creator.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.190 align:middle line:90%
But I agree with you--

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: --inspire people to--

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.890 align:middle line:84%
that they basically are
inspired by your film

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.600 align:middle line:84%
or have to fill in
the blanks sometimes.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:84%
That they themselves
can walk away and feel

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.040 align:middle line:90%
that they are co-creating.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.494 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or leave
it with a question.

00:30:37.494 --> 00:30:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: It could be--

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
it's interesting.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.593 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
interesting aspect.

00:30:41.593 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, you find
it more with sci-fi,

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and again, things that embrace
that spiritual domain to say,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:84%
let the audience
fill in the gaps.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Let them start to
imagine and play.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we've
seen over the most--

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:84%
the most successful
films, actually,

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.734 align:middle line:84%
are the ones kind of
like the "Star Wars"

00:30:59.734 --> 00:31:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and the "Harry Potters"
and "Game and Thrones"

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:84%
will actually go
out, and they start

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:04.924 align:middle line:84%
to create their own
worlds from it, right?

00:31:04.924 --> 00:31:06.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think
you want ultimately.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.120 align:middle line:10%
We want for humanity to become
co-creators in our reality.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.420 align:middle line:10%
We want humans to embrace
their own creative aspirations,

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:10%
their own creative beings to
express them more and more,

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.100 align:middle line:10%
rather than depending on the
little man by the curtain,

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.130 align:middle line:10%
whether it's the mainstream
media, filmmakers, producers,

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.205 align:middle line:10%
studios to tell them what
to do and how to live.

00:31:26.205 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.440 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't agree more with you,
and that's beautifully stated.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.210 align:middle line:10%
And that takes us
right into conspiracy,

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:10%
because there is an
apparent agenda that

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.540 align:middle line:10%
would see to it that
we have attention span

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:42.400 align:middle line:10%
shortages, to see that our
neural networking has been

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.200 align:middle line:10%
re-engineered to
the extent we really

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.230 align:middle line:10%
can't even hold a willful
thought, no less a thought

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.150 align:middle line:10%
of our own, for very long.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening now
at an alarming rate

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.190 align:middle line:84%
among little children,
where I really

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
look at what's happening
for little kids

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.850 align:middle line:84%
just through the use
of video games alone.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.460 align:middle line:84%
I know that it can
explore into new realms,

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and it certainly
quickens the speed

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.090 align:middle line:90%
at which the brain operates.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:84%
But I look at the
inability to focus

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.011 align:middle line:84%
in the really young
generation right now,

00:32:13.011 --> 00:32:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and what that's going
to look like as they

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:90%
get a little older?

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.120 align:middle line:84%
How do you then
re-engineer that?

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And let's take that into
the conspiracy at large.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:22.090 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: The conspiracy
to create ADD?

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.190 align:middle line:90%
Among many others.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Essentially,
I think the real goal--

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and some have talked about
the cybernetic agenda,

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:90%
transhumanism.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to essentially
merge humans with machines.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.460 align:middle line:90%
It's being done already.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.190 align:middle line:84%
They're chipping employees
in Sweden, I've heard,

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and other places, and
the employees love it.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.070 align:middle line:90%
They said, you know, great.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.278 align:middle line:90%
I could open the door faster.

00:32:45.278 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I can use my chip
as a debit card.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:49.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's insane.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just heard an NPR
program on this the other day,

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.490 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, oh, God, guys.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't give it a voice.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:55.592 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:32:55.592 --> 00:32:57.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at it
and examine it now,

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:90%
because it's there.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:32:59.350 align:middle line:90%
It's being done.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the
globalization thing

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.430 align:middle line:84%
has been positive
in so many ways.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.947 align:middle line:84%
We love the fact
that we can not only

00:33:12.947 --> 00:33:14.530 align:middle line:84%
see people from all
different cultures

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and embrace them as our cousins,
brothers, neighbors now.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:90%
We can eat food--

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.100 align:middle line:90%
my Dad would tell me--

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We love
fusion cuisine.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: My dad
in the '70s would

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.680 align:middle line:84%
say, New York City, it was like,
you know, the food was awful.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And then the '80s
started to get better.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.900 align:middle line:84%
By the '90s, it was
like you could actually

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:84%
have Japanese and Indian and
Chinese and all-- well, Chinese

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:90%
by the '70s.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.684 align:middle line:84%
But you had all these global
foods coming together.

00:33:34.684 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's wonderful to see
this aspect of globalization,

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.530 align:middle line:84%
which is trade, and bringing
the best of cultures together.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%
The danger of globalization
is when you destroy cultures

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to this notion of market-based
morality, basically.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, if the
corporation decides

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:84%
what's right, if people are
buying from Starbucks, that's

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.310 align:middle line:90%
what's right.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
they're using slaves,

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.530 align:middle line:84%
if they're destroying
local coffee growers

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, poor people being
able to grow their own coffee.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.940 align:middle line:84%
If those people are
being basically decimated

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.640 align:middle line:84%
by Starbucks as a corporation
growing and expanding,

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.440 align:middle line:90%
so be it.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.880 align:middle line:90%
People like Starbucks, right?

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the mentality of
the corporate morality.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's not morality.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:21.976 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not morality.

00:34:21.976 --> 00:34:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: But that's
the real dark side,

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:84%
the ugly side of
globalization has been about.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when it comes
to this merging of humanity,

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.980 align:middle line:84%
it's as though we see it already
like in the fear of Islam

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you can't have a
different way of dressing.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.966 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a
different way of being.

00:34:38.966 --> 00:34:41.139 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not
talking about terrorists.

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:42.384 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's a very small--

00:34:42.384 --> 00:34:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Supposedly
for their own good.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.549 align:middle line:84%
To protect them from the
wrath of the intolerant.

00:34:46.549 --> 00:34:47.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's not really it.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It's just one
expression of one culture

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.430 align:middle line:90%
amongst many.

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But many cultures have
very similar practices

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.340 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
the relationship

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:90%
and the roles of man and woman.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:35:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the cultural
dress and traditional value

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:01.000 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.216 align:middle line:84%
And on one hand, yes, there
are negative sides to those.

00:35:04.216 --> 00:35:06.340 align:middle line:84%
There are also negative
sides to our value systems,

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.510 align:middle line:90%
as we know very well.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:12.020 align:middle line:84%
The exploitation of women,
children, men, and everyone

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.264 align:middle line:84%
who gets exploited in
our society as well.

00:35:14.264 --> 00:35:15.680 align:middle line:84%
It's just done in
a different way.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:84%
It's always done
with the notion of,

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.000 align:middle line:84%
well, it's always in the
best interest of the market,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's the best
interest of the economy.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So we can justify
our exploitation.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.650 align:middle line:84%
But if it has to do
with cultural reasoning,

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.140 align:middle line:84%
traditional reasoning,
that's invalid

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.700 align:middle line:84%
compared to the idea
of market economics.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Then it's valid.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.600 align:middle line:84%
If you go and kill
people for money,

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.940 align:middle line:84%
you're morally justified as
a mercenary, for example.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.329 align:middle line:84%
If you kill someone in the
name of God, you're immoral.

00:35:40.329 --> 00:35:41.995 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
either one is moral.

00:35:41.995 --> 00:35:42.570 align:middle line:90%
I just think that--

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's whoever's
interests are served.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's ironic to basically
make that distinction.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.760 align:middle line:84%
So we came to this place
of amalgamating all people

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.650 align:middle line:84%
around the notion
of market economics

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and the notion that well look
kids like Disney and Disney

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.090 align:middle line:84%
actually frankly transformed
the entire world.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And up until the '60s,
'70s-- well, it was probably,

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.150 align:middle line:84%
say-- yeah '50s,
'60s, '70s, you didn't

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.082 align:middle line:90%
have children's entertainment.

00:36:06.082 --> 00:36:07.540 align:middle line:84%
You had fairy tales
that were told.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:84%
You had certain books
that were written.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if it was
"Grimms' Fairy Tales."

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.053 align:middle line:90%
The "Grimms' Fairy Tales."

00:36:12.053 --> 00:36:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But the culture was
about educating people

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:20.642 align:middle line:84%
to become more wise,
more mature, more aware.

00:36:20.642 --> 00:36:24.760 align:middle line:84%
It was about educating-- how do
you say-- educating the masses

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.450 align:middle line:84%
and bringing people together
as a community or a society.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.210 align:middle line:84%
You've had this total
inversion where everything

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:33.730 align:middle line:84%
has become about
children's entertainment,

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
even to the place where
the major movies that are

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.590 align:middle line:90%
coming out are for children.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:40.870 align:middle line:84%
If your major form of
entertainment and art

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:42.730 align:middle line:84%
is directed towards
children, what

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:46.225 align:middle line:84%
does that mean about the
mindset of the adults?

00:36:46.225 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Where is their mind?

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:84%
How intelligent and
mature can they be?

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.180 align:middle line:90%
No, exactly.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And so then you go to the notion
of the entrainment processes

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.440 align:middle line:90%
of these films.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Just take Disney alone.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's pretty
much the same theme

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:84%
that runs through every single
Disney movie, which is a--

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: The place where
we have to repeat--

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.230 align:middle line:84%
now they're just
remaking the old ones.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Just over and over again, which
had a very strong conditioning

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.200 align:middle line:84%
effect on certainly
my generation,

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.720 align:middle line:84%
because I was raised
on Disney films.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.340 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, it was a split.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I read the fairy tales,
"Grimms' Fairy Tales," I loved.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:21.440 align:middle line:84%
But also Disney, "Wizard
of Oz" and such as well

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.940 align:middle line:90%
was one of the very early ones.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.660 align:middle line:84%
That started creating
a very unrealistic view

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:84%
of what we were to expect
as we grew into life.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the first
time masses of people

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.130 align:middle line:84%
had been indoctrinated
in such an absolutely

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:36.389 align:middle line:90%
delusional expectation of life.

00:37:36.389 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: How many women grew
up thinking that they were

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.240 align:middle line:90%
going to meet Prince Charming?

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're still waiting.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:90%
We're all still waiting.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.230 align:middle line:84%
If you were raised
on Disney, you're

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.150 align:middle line:84%
probably still
waiting on some level,

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.880 align:middle line:84%
even if it's subconscious
at this point.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: And what
happened to the mothers?

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So basically with this
shortened attention span,

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.310 align:middle line:84%
with throwing
entertainment at it,

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one obvious
outcome could

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:84%
be you're creating a
very compliant consumer

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:90%
species for one, right?

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.678 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And would you say
that's part of the agenda

00:38:06.678 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
right there, to be able to
feed the global machine?

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:16.290 align:middle line:84%
The notion is,
productivity can be

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.710 align:middle line:84%
done more efficiently
and quickly, as far

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:23.520 align:middle line:84%
as what we've been able to
achieve by computer technology.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.574 align:middle line:90%
And this is wonderful.

00:38:27.574 --> 00:38:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Under rational
conditions, we should all

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.790 align:middle line:84%
be able to live with a
decent standard of living,

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:84%
with access to food,
with access to education.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And most of our time
actually would not

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.000 align:middle line:84%
have to be devoted to
doing menial tasks anymore,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.940 align:middle line:84%
because the machines would
take over menial jobs,

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and we could have more
time to do creative tasks.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:49.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting
that we actually

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:51.870 align:middle line:84%
seem to be working
longer hours, right?

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:55.350 align:middle line:84%
We're working longer
hours for less pay

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:59.160 align:middle line:84%
to basically just achieve
the standard of living that,

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.560 align:middle line:84%
frankly, as far as real
wages are concerned,

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.159 align:middle line:84%
we actually have lower wages
in America than we did in 1970.

00:39:05.159 --> 00:39:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And the standard of living
in places like Detroit

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.180 align:middle line:90%
has collapsed since 1960.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So Detroit's an example
of other cities.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just--

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:84%
it's indicative of
the problem that you

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.850 align:middle line:84%
have in the middle class
of America shrinking.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.310 align:middle line:84%
You have most Americans,
an average loss

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:27.020 align:middle line:84%
about a third of their wealth
since the 2009 collapse.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the stock
market's over 20,000.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we live in
the consumption model,

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:37.890 align:middle line:84%
the consumption model basically
being debt-based consumption.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Which, as we know, will
not sustain itself forever.

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:42.360 align:middle line:90%
At some point--

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
bubble has to burst.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, the
scary thing is obviously

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:50.670 align:middle line:84%
how they burst it as far as
does it become literally putting

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:54.360 align:middle line:84%
people to work camps or building
ridiculous things like a wall

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.600 align:middle line:90%
between here and Mexico.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.710 align:middle line:84%
It's about cutting off
the unemployed completely.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're not a humane
society in that regard.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't believe in redeploying
people towards things that

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.620 align:middle line:84%
are industrious,
infrastructure, industry, things

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.840 align:middle line:84%
that help markets
thrive and grow.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:84%
We're more into the idea
of just, as you say,

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.215 align:middle line:90%
market-based--

00:40:13.215 --> 00:40:17.726 align:middle line:84%
well, especially the stock
market, market-based success.

00:40:17.726 --> 00:40:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And so much of that is
basically monopoly capital--

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.180 align:middle line:84%
or I would say
casino capitalism.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
basically have seen,

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:26.430 align:middle line:84%
is the explosion of
the casino economy

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and the destruction of these
traditional working class

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.820 align:middle line:90%
and middle class.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
go into the area--

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.593 align:middle line:84%
because it's a passion of yours,
to really start understanding

00:40:33.593 --> 00:40:37.634 align:middle line:84%
and taking a look at what you
call empire and the elite,

00:40:37.634 --> 00:40:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and the hidden hand that seems
to be guiding a lot of what

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:42.000 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.912 align:middle line:84%
Because I know this
is a passion of yours.

00:40:43.912 --> 00:40:45.870 align:middle line:84%
It's what you did your
dissertation on as well.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And there are a couple of
funky, interesting little points

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.240 align:middle line:84%
in here that we don't really
consider that you make.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.576 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right, right.

00:40:52.576 --> 00:40:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, empire is
an interesting concept,

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:84%
because people assume
America is now an empire.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's a
question of having

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.040 align:middle line:84%
a financial elite
that really are

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.080 align:middle line:84%
the hub, the heart
of the empire.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And then that financial elite
basically buys influence

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:14.500 align:middle line:84%
within the government, and as
well as intelligence services

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:18.600 align:middle line:84%
that really have always been
tied to the financial elite.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
they look abroad

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to control resources
globally, right?

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And that tends to be where
the deployment of military

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
goes towards controlling
access to natural resources.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But see, the American
empire is really

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.040 align:middle line:84%
just the extension of the
Anglo-American empire,

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.380 align:middle line:90%
the British Empire.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And that was the focus of,
as you mentioned, the book.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:43.710 align:middle line:84%
First it was my
thesis at college,

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and then it became a
book, "New World Order."

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it was this
concept of, wait.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not just America looking
to expand itself globally.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:56.539 align:middle line:84%
It's actually this
Anglo ideology about--

00:41:56.539 --> 00:41:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying to re-exert
itself on this land.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.621 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Well, precisely.

00:41:59.621 --> 00:42:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And this ideology that we
have the greatest rule of law

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and the system of laws,
so we have-- basically,

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.640 align:middle line:84%
the globe should follow
our control of finance,

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.390 align:middle line:84%
of international
legal structures,

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:17.880 align:middle line:84%
of basically-- even the UN,
basically, was a construct very

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:84%
much of the US and the
British working together

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to formulate that
body, and having

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:27.550 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous amount of influence
over the structures of it.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So it was a move towards
global government.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.700 align:middle line:84%
That was really what the
new world order was about,

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:36.060 align:middle line:84%
played out by the British,
through their proxy,

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.330 align:middle line:84%
being the Americans who at the
time of the Second World War

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:43.230 align:middle line:84%
were just so much more powerful
militarily, financially

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:44.310 align:middle line:90%
than the British were.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.940 align:middle line:84%
But the British were
still very influential.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:48.750 align:middle line:90%
All our banks.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:52.620 align:middle line:84%
People forget that all our banks
were actually either originated

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.062 align:middle line:90%
or financed by the British.

00:42:54.062 --> 00:42:56.145 align:middle line:84%
So if you take JP Morgan,
it was Morgan, Grenfell.

00:42:56.145 --> 00:42:59.040 align:middle line:90%
It was a British collaboration.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Brown Brothers Harriman
was a British bank,

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and that became the
Harriman family.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.310 align:middle line:84%
The Bush family came out of
the Brown Brothers Harriman.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:10.040 align:middle line:84%
The Rockefellers got a lot of
their financing from England.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.200 align:middle line:84%
The Warburgs came
over from England.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So it was a lot of influence out
of the British financial system

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:17.570 align:middle line:90%
based in the city of London.

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's, to me, still the
heart-- the city of London,

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Wall Street is still the
heart of global influence

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:24.890 align:middle line:90%
and control.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's also an
old white man ideology there

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:28.589 align:middle line:90%
that persists.

00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that, because it's not

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.750 align:middle line:84%
an old white man's
world anymore.

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And the lengths that we'll
go to to protect what

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.460 align:middle line:84%
they have created for themselves
at the detriment of all

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.260 align:middle line:90%
the rest.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Precisely.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.180 align:middle line:90%
It's an old white man's world.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.360 align:middle line:90%
And frankly, it never was.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.034 align:middle line:84%
But they had to
exert themselves,

00:43:46.034 --> 00:43:48.200 align:middle line:84%
as I said, through ideology,
through this notion of,

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.490 align:middle line:90%
we have the rule of law.

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:52.820 align:middle line:84%
We have to train you, and
basically give influence to you

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.150 align:middle line:90%
through the IMF, for example.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:56.390 align:middle line:84%
If you want to have
access to money,

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.510 align:middle line:84%
it has to come through
the IMF and the World Bank

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and our debt schedule,
basically, and our loan system.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.052 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.052 --> 00:44:05.510 align:middle line:84%
The thing about
the new world order

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:09.560 align:middle line:84%
was that really, it was going to
be a process of bringing people

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.880 align:middle line:84%
from Africa, Asia, the
Middle East to study

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.914 align:middle line:90%
at Oxford, for example.

00:44:14.914 --> 00:44:16.580 align:middle line:84%
That was the Rhodes
Scholarship process.

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, it
was to study at Harvard.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know, and our American
eastern establishment schools

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to train them in our ways of
doing business and finance

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.340 align:middle line:90%
and thinking.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And then basically, becoming
the leaders of those--

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that all sounds
nice at face value, right?

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.220 align:middle line:90%
On one level.

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:40.370 align:middle line:84%
But Cecil Rhodes was actually
instrumental in the creation

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:42.102 align:middle line:90%
of apartheid as well.

00:44:42.102 --> 00:44:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, again, it's
an imperialist philosophy,

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.630 align:middle line:84%
because we believe that
our school of thought,

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:51.510 align:middle line:84%
our free trade liberalism is the
pinnacle of the way the world

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:52.310 align:middle line:90%
should--

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They know the way
the world should be run.

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:54.710 align:middle line:90%
They know best.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yeah.

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And you take systems like even
in Islam, you can't actually--

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:02.730 align:middle line:84%
you cannot issue debt
with interest, right?

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.550 align:middle line:84%
That's actually against
the law in Islam.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was supposed to be
the law within Christianity

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.260 align:middle line:90%
and Judaism as well, right?

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Was this notion of, you can't
have usurious interest rates

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:13.130 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:15.630 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed to
issue debt with interest.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So we've basically swept
all that aside to say, well,

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:22.106 align:middle line:84%
this is the nature of capitalism
and how it's going to work.

00:45:22.106 --> 00:45:23.480 align:middle line:84%
But there are
alternative schools

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:28.220 align:middle line:84%
of how you can actually finance
corporations and businesses

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.794 align:middle line:84%
to basically launch
themselves, get started.

00:45:30.794 --> 00:45:32.210 align:middle line:84%
They pay it back
to the government

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:35.240 align:middle line:84%
or whoever's financing it,
and then they run themselves,

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.449 align:middle line:90%
those businesses.

00:45:36.449 --> 00:45:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And you know, on the whole, it's
just the idea as we've seen,

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:40.735 align:middle line:90%
this consolidation of power.

00:45:40.735 --> 00:45:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
evident if you look

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.610 align:middle line:84%
at the nature of
the banking system,

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and how we basically
have a handful of banks,

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:50.270 align:middle line:84%
about five major banks in the
US, and they have almost half

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.580 align:middle line:84%
of the depositors' wealth
in this country, right?

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.830 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have the biggest
banks in the world in 1990.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:56.746 align:middle line:84%
It was during the Clinton
era that he actually

00:45:56.746 --> 00:45:58.610 align:middle line:84%
started t deregulate
and allow these banks

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:02.797 align:middle line:84%
to become massive national
banks and transnational banks.

00:46:02.797 --> 00:46:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So you see this consolidation
of wealth and power,

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.088 align:middle line:84%
and you see it also in the
corporate realm the notion

00:46:07.088 --> 00:46:09.650 align:middle line:84%
that there's actually a
thousand corporations that

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:12.290 align:middle line:84%
have the assets, that basically
manage the assets of most

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:13.170 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:13.970 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So this type of consolidation
has been taking place,

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and this is the dark
side of globalization,

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.220 align:middle line:84%
because we're not necessarily
empowering-- sure,

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.160 align:middle line:84%
you could say the average wage
has gone up in a few countries

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.570 align:middle line:90%
like China and others.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:29.810 align:middle line:84%
But on the whole, we're not
empowering the small businesses

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:33.620 align:middle line:84%
and the middle class, working
class to actually-- you

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.360 align:middle line:84%
know, even the unions
have fallen away

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.910 align:middle line:84%
while these corporations have
become bigger and bigger,

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:38.210 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:39.334 align:middle line:90%
And we say, unions are bad.

00:46:39.334 --> 00:46:40.975 align:middle line:84%
Well, unions are
from a corporation,

00:46:40.975 --> 00:46:42.350 align:middle line:84%
but they're supposed
to represent

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:43.740 align:middle line:90%
at least the little man.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:45.920 align:middle line:90%
And there is an attempt.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have read
various outlines, programs,

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.440 align:middle line:84%
agendas that would have to do
with the reemergence of funding

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.920 align:middle line:84%
for small and mid-sized
businesses, SMEs, right?

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same time,
it's a seemingly overwhelming

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:07.130 align:middle line:84%
obstacle to wresting money
out of the existing system

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to be able to flow it
back into more egalitarian

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.050 align:middle line:84%
systems of finance that allow
people to express themselves

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.900 align:middle line:84%
in their own community, to
hire their friends and family,

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.900 align:middle line:84%
to have complex,
rich society again.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It's been shut down.

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.922 align:middle line:84%
How do you see that
reversing itself?

00:47:23.922 --> 00:47:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: There was
a lot of issues.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the problem you're
dealing with ultimately

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.860 align:middle line:84%
is, we could say, human
nature is averse to risk

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.420 align:middle line:90%
and wants to go with the winner.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:35.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the big problem-- the big
issue within human psychology,

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.000 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.274 align:middle line:84%
So why should I invest
in a small business in--

00:47:39.274 --> 00:47:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
built this country

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:42.016 align:middle line:90%
and every other country.

00:47:42.016 --> 00:47:44.016 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Why should I
invest in a small business

00:47:44.016 --> 00:47:47.840 align:middle line:84%
in a neighborhood when I can
invest in Starbucks or Apple,

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.114 align:middle line:84%
or one of these
major corporations?

00:47:50.114 --> 00:47:51.530 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to
saying, well, I like

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:53.222 align:middle line:84%
to do business with
this small business,

00:47:53.222 --> 00:47:54.680 align:middle line:84%
because they're in
my neighborhood.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.919 align:middle line:90%
I know the people.

00:47:55.919 --> 00:47:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'd rather see the
money in their hands

00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:59.990 align:middle line:84%
than someone I've
never met before.

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:02.670 align:middle line:84%
This is like a way of
shifting the psychology.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:06.800 align:middle line:84%
But we have a problem where
basically the seven biggest

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.720 align:middle line:90%
industries globally--

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:14.540 align:middle line:84%
gambling, sex trafficking,
prostitution, arms, drugs, oil,

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.370 align:middle line:90%
and energy, right?

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a tremendous
issue that we're dealing with,

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:21.740 align:middle line:84%
that we basically, as
humans, we love the vices,

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and the government
basically capitalizes on it

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.390 align:middle line:84%
by turning those into
things that are supposed

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:29.030 align:middle line:84%
to be illegal, and then allowing
the money to be laundered

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:30.420 align:middle line:90%
into the system anyway.

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And actually exploiting
these illegalities

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:36.000 align:middle line:84%
to create massive money-making
schemes like the war on drugs,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:36.920 align:middle line:90%
the war on terror.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Ways of just putting people into
jails for victimless crimes.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:46.424 align:middle line:84%
You know, for suspicion of
their being dangerous people.

00:48:46.424 --> 00:48:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But end of the
day, we're actually

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.640 align:middle line:84%
turning them into criminals
through this institution--

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.724 align:middle line:84%
to institutionalization
through the prison system.

00:48:52.724 --> 00:48:54.223 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of
money, again, that

00:48:54.223 --> 00:48:55.700 align:middle line:84%
flows in the private
prison sector

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.610 align:middle line:90%
into the enforcement sector.

00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:58.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's like--

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:02.570 align:middle line:84%
it's insane how we're
capitalizing it and reinforcing

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.150 align:middle line:84%
vice and destructive activity
and behavior, as opposed

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:10.220 align:middle line:84%
to inciting positive things like
constructing high-speed rail

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.220 align:middle line:84%
systems, putting money
into new energy sectors,

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.484 align:middle line:90%
putting money into new markets.

00:49:16.484 --> 00:49:17.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, again,
small businesses.

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Allowing those small
stock exchanges

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.880 align:middle line:84%
to replace the New
York Stock Exchange.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So again, like you
said, why can't we

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:27.867 align:middle line:84%
have small stock
exchanges, and each--

00:49:27.867 --> 00:49:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The proliferation
again of private banks, even

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.640 align:middle line:90%
state banks.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, and again, when you
take it back to the elite,

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.520 align:middle line:84%
go back to the
macro, you're talking

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.530 align:middle line:84%
about exploiting human frailty
and desires and weaknesses

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.480 align:middle line:84%
to create a bloated
black budget,

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.700 align:middle line:84%
where the money simply
disappears into funding

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.230 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is that they need.

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it's a capture of
resources and creating wars

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:53.255 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, contracts
with their buddies

00:49:53.255 --> 00:49:54.880 align:middle line:84%
within the military
industrial complex.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: It disappears
offshore and never comes back.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do it off of us.

00:49:57.830 --> 00:49:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Yes.

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The thing is,
they're exploiting our weakness

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.079 align:middle line:84%
to start the whole
chain of events.

00:50:02.079 --> 00:50:02.878 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:50:02.878 --> 00:50:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they fleece you
twice, because basically, they

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:07.230 align:middle line:84%
create a bubble,
they create a crash,

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and then they have
the public foot

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:10.970 align:middle line:90%
the bill to the private sector.

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet the only
thing common to all of this

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.900 align:middle line:90%
is us, right?

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.710 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that can choose
to support their industries

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.260 align:middle line:84%
that they're creating,
whether it's gambling,

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:24.320 align:middle line:84%
whether it's drugs,
prostitution and whatnot.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Child pornography.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:30.080 align:middle line:84%
We, the base, at the base of
that pyramid that they like

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.100 align:middle line:84%
to show, are the ones
that are supporting it

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:40.250 align:middle line:84%
through our voluntary giving
of our resources over to that.

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So it really has
to stop with us.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.470 align:middle line:84%
There has to be something
that creates a kind of--

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and I don't use
this word lightly--

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.480 align:middle line:84%
but a kind of a new
morality on the planet

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.310 align:middle line:84%
so that we can't be
fleeced the first time.

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:54.561 align:middle line:84%
Then there's nothing to
fleece the second time, right?

00:50:54.561 --> 00:50:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
ideal, I would say.

00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The ideal situation
is where we basically

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:04.790 align:middle line:84%
form within bands of people
that are aware, awake,

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:09.110 align:middle line:84%
conscious beings, trying to
basically-- working together

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:10.352 align:middle line:90%
in new communal structures.

00:51:10.352 --> 00:51:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to globalization,
it doesn't

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.740 align:middle line:84%
have to be in the
small scale anymore.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.948 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to just be
your neighbors and friends.

00:51:15.948 --> 00:51:17.700 align:middle line:90%
You can literally be global.

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense,
it's almost like,

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.030 align:middle line:84%
you know, a new Silk Road
concept, but a global Silk

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.739 align:middle line:84%
Road, where we can
trade with each other.

00:51:24.739 --> 00:51:26.238 align:middle line:84%
And we can recognize,
you know what?

00:51:26.238 --> 00:51:27.780 align:middle line:90%
I want to support that business.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:28.980 align:middle line:90%
I want to eat organic foods.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to eat from
the local farmers.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I want to support the local
shops, the local manufacturers.

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And also, 3D printing
is helping, by the way,

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:40.805 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of those manufacturers
on a smaller scale,

00:51:40.805 --> 00:51:44.447 align:middle line:84%
bringing industry
back closer to home.

00:51:44.447 --> 00:51:46.280 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, it's about people

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.900 align:middle line:84%
who are recognizing
the conscious community

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.870 align:middle line:90%
to work with each other.

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the key,
creating new banks, new banking

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:57.295 align:middle line:84%
systems that we can loan to
each other and help each other.

00:51:57.295 --> 00:52:00.280 align:middle line:84%
It may not have the scale
of finance behind it

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.140 align:middle line:90%
that a Citibank would have.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But I think it could
be done, and done

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:06.400 align:middle line:84%
in a way that was
old-fashioned in the sense of,

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.639 align:middle line:84%
you invest things that you
can touch and understand.

00:52:09.639 --> 00:52:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Derivatives, no one understood.

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:12.010 align:middle line:90%
That's why when--

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
didn't understand.

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.518 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, when Michael
Moore did his last documentary,

00:52:15.518 --> 00:52:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and he said, in Iceland, the
women ran the bank in Iceland,

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.330 align:middle line:84%
they said, we didn't
invest in derivatives,

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:20.245 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't understand
what the heck they

00:52:20.245 --> 00:52:21.045 align:middle line:90%
were talking about.

00:52:21.045 --> 00:52:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result, their
bank didn't collapse.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So what happened to that
notion of, like, investing

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.460 align:middle line:84%
in things you can have
a tangible product from?

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Investing in people,
investing in people

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:32.920 align:middle line:84%
doing productive work as
opposed to this notion

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:36.820 align:middle line:84%
of just investing in money and
the idea of creating wealth

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.590 align:middle line:84%
for money in
speculation on things

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:41.710 align:middle line:84%
that have actually no tangible
result, because it's literally

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:42.510 align:middle line:90%
just--

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:44.770 align:middle line:84%
it's a casino game
of betting, right?

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's like betting
on a basketball game.

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the basketball game
can generate some revenue.

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:50.837 align:middle line:84%
But most of this
betting around it

00:52:50.837 --> 00:52:52.920 align:middle line:84%
is not actually doing
anything productive with it.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just taking money
out of your pocket

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.800 align:middle line:90%
and putting it in mine.

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and we're on
exactly the same page on this.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think, you
know, the frustration

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:04.030 align:middle line:84%
has been that human beings think
through activism in particular

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that somehow, we're going
to equalize the system.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to somehow
shift the nature of the game

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and wrest the money away from
the Citibanks of this world,

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and the other people who
control those money supplies.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.660 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Now they could crash
of their own accord

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.430 align:middle line:84%
if they keep misstepping
the way they are.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But the little man, so to
speak, the average person

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.630 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to wrest money
away from that system

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:30.250 align:middle line:90%
to pump into their own.

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I've watched many people
behind the scenes trying to do

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:34.180 align:middle line:90%
this over the last 10 years.

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.700 align:middle line:84%
People that are well-connected
in the world of intelligence

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:39.082 align:middle line:84%
and finance that are
really working hard--

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on some of
the other shows,

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:41.789 align:middle line:90%
they call them the white hats.

00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And I know some of
this quite personally.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:49.060 align:middle line:90%
And you can fantasize about it.

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.330 align:middle line:90%
We can wish and we can hope.

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, I have seen
absolutely no forward movement

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:56.740 align:middle line:90%
toward any of that happening.

00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's because
the forces of corruption

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.520 align:middle line:84%
where the money already
exists is so great and holding

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.320 align:middle line:90%
so tightly.

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.760 align:middle line:90%
So we're down to what?

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.760 align:middle line:90%
Local currencies.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.830 align:middle line:90%
We're down to goodwill.

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:07.327 align:middle line:90%
We're down to creativity.

00:54:07.327 --> 00:54:09.160 align:middle line:84%
That's where I want to
go with the last part

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.170 align:middle line:84%
of this conversation,
which is, you had

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:13.104 align:middle line:90%
a fine background in education.

00:54:13.104 --> 00:54:14.020 align:middle line:90%
You went to Princeton.

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:16.725 align:middle line:90%
You had a lot of advantages.

00:54:16.725 --> 00:54:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Now we're looking
at a time where

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:23.200 align:middle line:84%
we need to move past the
industrial era of education.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.130 align:middle line:84%
It does create good worker bees,
but it is not serving the task

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.650 align:middle line:84%
at hand to create
our own system,

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:31.180 align:middle line:90%
recreate our own societies.

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:34.210 align:middle line:84%
How do you look at
education from here on out?

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:35.850 align:middle line:84%
These little brilliant
kids coming up.

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.349 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
stick them in there

00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and memorize their times
tables and that's it,

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and give them a
job as an engineer

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.030 align:middle line:84%
out the other end of
the sausage machine?

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, I
would love to have

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.742 align:middle line:90%
them taking jobs as engineers.

00:54:47.742 --> 00:54:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Actually, most American kids
aren't doing engineering jobs.

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.120 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
going to be having

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Chinese and Indian kids, and--

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, no, that's true.

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I misspoke, because
those have been outsourced.

00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: I think engineering
is a tremendous craft--

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.066 align:middle line:90%
But you know what I'm saying.

00:55:02.066 --> 00:55:04.310 align:middle line:84%
There are people that
break the design--

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: This indoctrination
process, I would call it.

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
main thing is if you

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.480 align:middle line:84%
want to transform
education, you have

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.060 align:middle line:84%
to transform the way
that we understand

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.840 align:middle line:90%
learning and creativity.

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:18.010 align:middle line:84%
You can't learn by being
forced to memorize something

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:19.210 align:middle line:90%
or being told something.

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:21.160 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn
by experiencing it.

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.650 align:middle line:84%
If you want to understand
the Pythagorean theorem,

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:26.480 align:middle line:84%
for example, you
challenge the students.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.060 align:middle line:84%
You say, let's
recreate this issue.

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.920 align:middle line:90%
We have a square here.

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.120 align:middle line:84%
How do we know the
length of this side

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.120 align:middle line:84%
if we don't know the
length of that side, right?

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.990 align:middle line:84%
You start posing these
types of questions.

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:37.340 align:middle line:90%
How do we know degrees?

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can literally
recreate the process

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:43.030 align:middle line:84%
of scientific, mathematical
discovery, creative innovation.

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:45.430 align:middle line:84%
You can do these
things with students

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:47.272 align:middle line:84%
and have them
interacting with you.

00:55:47.272 --> 00:55:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not opposed to
the idea of school systems.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm all for it.

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:52.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm all for people, if they want
to take their kids out and do

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:55.120 align:middle line:84%
private schooling and home
schooling, that's great too.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- it's the quality
of the actual teaching

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and engaging process
of how much you're

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.140 align:middle line:84%
willing to engage
the students and get

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:05.470 align:middle line:84%
them interacting with you in
this process of discovery.

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end of
the day, I remember

00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:12.340 align:middle line:84%
feeling very much
bored in the sense of,

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.020 align:middle line:90%
oh, we've discovered everything.

00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.047 align:middle line:90%
We know everything.

00:56:15.047 --> 00:56:15.880 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing new.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.220 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing new under
the sun, that concept.

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to actually
explore things, and oftentimes,

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.799 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical things or
just reassessing science.

00:56:23.799 --> 00:56:25.090 align:middle line:90%
And you realize, wait a minute.

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:28.780 align:middle line:84%
We really know nothing
about what humans are,

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.480 align:middle line:84%
where we come from,
what we're doing here.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So then it becomes fascinating
to start to say, wait a minute.

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:39.212 align:middle line:84%
My creativity, my imagination is
the treasure, and it has value.

00:56:39.212 --> 00:56:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And you can't write that off.

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And you can't say, well, it
doesn't matter what you think,

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.740 align:middle line:90%
because these are the facts.

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And you study history,
and you're like,

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.440 align:middle line:90%
you know almost nothing.

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.120 align:middle line:90%
It's like really, we don't know.

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
institutionalized education

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:53.450 align:middle line:90%
is a product of the elite.

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't disconnect
these things for specific

00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.360 align:middle line:84%
again, like,
creating video games

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and such that created
short attention spans

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:03.654 align:middle line:84%
to create a drive
toward consumption.

00:57:03.654 --> 00:57:05.570 align:middle line:84%
It's no different on the
production end of it,

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:08.720 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, when you're talking
about the educational system.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.310 align:middle line:90%
And so how is that going to be--

00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: Well, I always
just tell people, look.

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.970 align:middle line:84%
When you're a child, you look
at children, they're so bright.

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Their eyes are awake.

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:20.479 align:middle line:84%
They're probably more
intelligent than their parents.

00:57:20.479 --> 00:57:21.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You send
them to school,

00:57:21.895 --> 00:57:23.450 align:middle line:84%
it squashes that
light right out.

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Well, does it?

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It does in the sense that
if you don't have the time

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:31.070 align:middle line:84%
to actually treasure
and value and give

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:33.590 align:middle line:84%
that child unconditional love,
and this feeling of safety

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and security to be
who they are, then

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.424 align:middle line:90%
yes, it will be squashed out.

00:57:37.424 --> 00:57:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But that's also
what society does.

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.506 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
it's school or not.

00:57:40.506 --> 00:57:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Once you start engaging
with your peers,

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and they start
bringing their neuroses

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and what their parents told
them, and then next thing

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:49.470 align:middle line:84%
you know, your peers are
telling you, you know,

00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:50.360 align:middle line:90%
you can't do this.

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.917 align:middle line:84%
You're fat, you're ugly,
you're this, you're that.

00:57:52.917 --> 00:57:54.250 align:middle line:90%
You start to become brainwashed.

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:55.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Social norms
start becoming prevalent.

00:57:55.955 --> 00:57:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Exactly.

00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a question of--

00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I was tell people, trust
your individuality.

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:04.650 align:middle line:84%
It's unfortunate that 80% of
the population wants to conform.

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:05.450 align:middle line:90%
That's my average.

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:07.520 align:middle line:84%
About 80% want to
conform, 10% want

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.740 align:middle line:84%
to be individual and lead
and do the right thing,

00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and 10% are sociopathic
and want to lead us

00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:13.880 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong
direction completely

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.440 align:middle line:84%
for their own
manipulation and gain.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But 80% of the people
probably want to conform,

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.396 align:middle line:90%
and that's a problem.

00:58:19.396 --> 00:58:20.270 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't matter.

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:22.080 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
it's institutionalized

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:22.760 align:middle line:90%
at a high school--

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I think the
institutions are actually

00:58:24.885 --> 00:58:28.620 align:middle line:84%
creating that also,
because you're not--

00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.500 align:middle line:84%
to create from
one's own curiosity

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:33.410 align:middle line:84%
is really not part of the
standard state education.

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:35.270 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
music's knocked out.

00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Art's knocked out.

00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.400 align:middle line:90%
PE's knocked out.

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Every expression except
the basics are knocked out.

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:43.290 align:middle line:84%
That's not a
creative environment.

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you can overcome it
at home as parents and say, OK.

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.320 align:middle line:84%
We're sending you to
this awful school.

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that.

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.170 align:middle line:90%
You have to go.

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And then do what you can
to reverse it and give

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:55.250 align:middle line:84%
lots of opportunity
for flourishing

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:56.560 align:middle line:90%
of creativity at home.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.710 align:middle line:90%
But how do you start--

00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: With the
conformities in society.

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:02.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why, for thousands
of years, we go to war.

00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And people follow--
like Tolstoy-- was it

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.115 align:middle line:84%
Tolstoy who
basically said, look,

00:59:07.115 --> 00:59:08.698 align:middle line:84%
soldiers, if they
lay down their arms,

00:59:08.698 --> 00:59:09.950 align:middle line:90%
there'd be no more war, right?

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But the soldiers
are indoctrinated,

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and they've been doing it
for thousands of years.

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:14.933 align:middle line:84%
And you go to work, and
you're indoctrinated

00:59:14.933 --> 00:59:16.202 align:middle line:90%
into believing you have it.

00:59:16.202 --> 00:59:18.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to do a certain
job to make money as opposed

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:19.451 align:middle line:90%
to saying, wait a minute.

00:59:19.451 --> 00:59:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Let me do what I love.

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Let me trust who I
am as an individual.

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Let me follow my path, and
let the money, let the wealth,

00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:29.000 align:middle line:90%
let the success come to me.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.435 align:middle line:90%
We need to change the mindset.

00:59:30.435 --> 00:59:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:32.360 align:middle line:90%
So you're not cynical.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:36.065 align:middle line:84%
You're not saying that 80% are
destined to be conformist--

00:59:36.065 --> 00:59:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: We have been.

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:38.570 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
we're destined to be.

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:40.153 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
think we are either.

00:59:40.153 --> 00:59:42.215 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm still holding
out for the notion.

00:59:42.215 --> 00:59:45.170 align:middle line:84%
If you give a child
the opportunity

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:48.410 align:middle line:84%
to explore and create
and ask the right--

00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:51.920 align:middle line:84%
ask questions, any questions,
and have a good response,

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.720 align:middle line:84%
an honoring response
from their parents,

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.000 align:middle line:90%
I think we can recreate society.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.740 align:middle line:84%
But that means a
massive revolution

00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.009 align:middle line:90%
of the education system.

00:59:59.009 --> 01:00:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: It starts there.

01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:00.905 align:middle line:90%
It starts there.

01:00:00.905 --> 01:00:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
starts at home, I guess,

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and then it goes there.

01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Right.

01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Starts at home and it
goes to the schools.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.676 align:middle line:90%
It's such a monumental task.

01:00:08.676 --> 01:00:09.550 align:middle line:90%
It's almost daunting.

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know it is.

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I just--

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.218 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't have tossed that
out to you the last one minute

01:00:13.218 --> 01:00:14.562 align:middle line:90%
of the show, but there you go.

01:00:14.562 --> 01:00:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: This is why we pray.

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:16.769 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

01:00:16.769 --> 01:00:17.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And we engage in our
own understanding

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.310 align:middle line:84%
of what the realms function
like, and our place within it.

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>>STONE: Precisely.

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So any final thought?

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.676 align:middle line:84%
We only have, like,
a second left.

01:00:27.176 --> 01:00:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STONE: No, I think that
what you hit is exactly--

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.770 align:middle line:84%
you hit on exactly the
point, which is to say,

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:34.820 align:middle line:84%
let's trust that there is a
grand design that's guiding us.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:40.066 align:middle line:84%
So that even though this world
may look like hell oftentimes--

01:00:40.066 --> 01:00:41.690 align:middle line:84%
it seems like we live
in a kindergarten

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%
of the "Planet of the
Apes" half the time, right?

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:47.480 align:middle line:10%
I wonder-- maybe we really are
just apes on a spinning rock.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.280 align:middle line:10%
But, no.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.960 align:middle line:10%
I really believe that we're here
with a purpose, for a reason.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.186 align:middle line:84%
We have to trust that destiny,
and let the universe unfold.

01:00:55.186 --> 01:00:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:58.100 align:middle line:10%
And as I've said
before, I mean, I

01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.900 align:middle line:10%
think we're this
beautiful hybrid species

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.110 align:middle line:10%
if we can just kind of wake up.

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Wake up.

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much, Sean.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:05.616 align:middle line:84%
It's been a lot of
