00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:19.963 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:21.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We're here once again

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:10%
with Sheila Gillette
and the THEO group,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.430 align:middle line:10%
whom I will be talking with
about ancient civilizations

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.640 align:middle line:10%
and future civilizations as well
as some of the opportunities

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:10%
and challenges of present times.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:90%
And wild times these are.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Just before the camera
started rolling,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I said to the THEO
group, guys, thank you

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
for obliging me to go
on this wild ride today.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going
to go all over the map

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and basically, as we
were talking about,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
get a helicopter view
of some of the topics

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
that are concerning
people, but also,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:84%
some of our dreams, some
of what we'd like to see,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.635 align:middle line:84%
and some understanding
of way back when.

00:00:56.635 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Because that's just--

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.052 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
That sounds great.

00:00:59.052 --> 00:01:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --poking its
head up today again.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, how is everything
going on the ground?

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:84%
You're doing a lot of
channelings these days.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And what I've noticed
through the years

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
is that kind of--
themes start emerging.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.545 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well,
as you know, we

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:90%
do a lot of mentoring classes.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: And THEO
has brought forth

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:10%
a program called soul
integration, which

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:10%
is assisting people in
releasing or learning

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:10%
how to release limiting
beliefs that keep them

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:10%
from living lives they
really want to live and dream

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:10%
about living.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:10%
And it's just our
limiting beliefs

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:10%
that keep us from doing that,
thinking that we can't, we

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:10%
don't have enough,
whatever it is, but also,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:10%
talking to individuals.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
They're wanting to
up-level their lives.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
They want to feel comfortable
in their own skin.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
THEO has just started talking
about unconditional love.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And unconditional love, they
said, it's not a feeling.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a state of being.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And we thought that
was really interesting.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And exploring that, we found
out it's being soul centered,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.640 align:middle line:84%
feeling comfortable
in our own skin.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
No matter what's happening
in our life, as they say,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:90%
being the eye of the hurricane.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Because in the hurricane,
the eye is very calm,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
but the wind is
swirling about it.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And in our lives, it's
like that sometimes

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:90%
with challenges and conditions.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But if we can stay calm,
we can respond to life

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.880 align:middle line:90%
rather than react.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so as you
were talking about that--

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:84%
about unconditional love
is a state of being--

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and I was just-- what
flashed through my mind

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:90%
is something years ago.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:10%
I interviewed the well-known
physicist and Professor William

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:10%
Tiller--

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:10%
Bill Tiller.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:10%
And he said that love is
the universal solvent.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, isn't that
a perfect way to put it?

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that
binds it altogether.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we forget.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:84%
We lose track of
that, of course.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think one of the things
I was curious about, too,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:84%
is when you were talking
about these limiting beliefs,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.470 align:middle line:84%
is if the THEO group
were to tell us--

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
now, I can ask them
directly along with this--

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:90%
three pages of questions here--

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.830 align:middle line:84%
what our life potential is,
what the potential of the human

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
being is if you strip away
all of these limiting beliefs.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.648 align:middle line:84%
What are we capable of and
we just won't believe it?

00:03:30.648 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well,
what they tell us--

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
look what's happened in
just the last hundred

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.190 align:middle line:84%
years, the momentum now that
we're in the fifth dimension,

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and that it's more refined
vibration, that we're

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:84%
ready to recognize the
master beings that we are,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that our souls larger than
we can possibly imagine,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and that we've chosen
this human experience,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
this Earth suit to
navigate this planet,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:90%
but how exquisite it is.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And what's going to
be happening is just

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
this continued momentum
of up-leveling our lives

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:90%
and our consciousness.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.060 align:middle line:84%
They said this is a time
of a shift of consciousness

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:84%
never experienced before
in human experience.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
They said the other
day in a retreat

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that we did that when
we were living in--

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:84%
those of us in different
times in history.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
When somebody was living in the
medieval times, when they were

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:84%
living it, they
weren't thinking, well,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm living in the
medieval times.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
The description of that
came through history.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So they said this is
far beyond anything.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And someone asked, well,
what will this be called?

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And they said it's
not history yet.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Historians will name it.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Many are calling it the New Age,
but they said this isn't new.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:90%
It's always been.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:90%
We're just being awakened to it.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what are the
dynamics that are in place now,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
that are allowing people
to have theoretically

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
an explosion of awareness
and consciousness

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:90%
if we're ready for it?

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's the energy
of the fifth dimension.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
it in everything

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:90%
that's happening in the world.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
THEO talked about
this four decades ago

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:84%
in the book, "The 5th Dimension
Channels to a New Reality."

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.355 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about
this time right now.

00:05:25.355 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And that we
would become more global.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And the political structures
throughout the world

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:90%
will change.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to get into that

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:90%
when we get THEO online here.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.222 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And they
said there would

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:41.532 align:middle line:90%
be a global economic structure.

00:05:41.532 --> 00:05:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And we know that's happening.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:84%
After 2008, we got to realize
how we are in a global economy

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're encouraging us not
to be fearful of any of that.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people
that are fearful.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But they said we're one
species on this planet.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
We're the human
species, and that there

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
is enough here for
all of us, and that we

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:90%
should celebrate each other.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And the soul
integrative process--

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
they said if everybody would
do that and release beliefs

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:84%
about themselves that
are simply untrue,

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.180 align:middle line:84%
that we would all treat each
other with respect, and love,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:90%
and connectivity.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.260 align:middle line:84%
They say look when a
catastrophe happens.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:90%
What happens in the human--

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:84%
we can see that now
with technology.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:84%
In an instant, we can see
where there's an earthquake.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our empathy
and compassion rises to--

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: And everybody--

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --the surface.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --wants to help.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:84%
The majority of human
beings on the planet

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:90%
want to help each other.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:84%
We're collaborative,
not competitive.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So all of those old ways
of believing and thinking

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.767 align:middle line:90%
are changing.

00:06:56.767 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely And
I think there's sometimes

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:84%
some confusion when we're
talking about dimensions.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:90%
And let's just get into this.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:84%
When we're looking at our
multi-dimensional being,

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.740 align:middle line:84%
being able to reach in to
fifth dimension consciousness,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that's not to say
that our planet here--

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Earth has just crashed through
some dimensional shifts

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:90%
physically.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And just explain
that difference.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes people
get caught up in that

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.886 align:middle line:84%
and not understanding the
difference between the two.

00:07:22.886 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well,
what THEO says--

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:84%
there's 12 dimensions around
the Earth, and it's all energy.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
It's vibration and frequency,
and that our third dimension

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:90%
is our physical reality.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.530 align:middle line:84%
The fourth has been the
spiritual awakening.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.282 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, this is my
50th year as you know in--

00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, in channeling.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --this work.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So I have been witness to
these waves of awakening

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:84%
that people have
been having through

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:90%
their own personal experience.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Because as you know, Regina,
we are all connected.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
We're not disconnected
beings from source.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
We're just waking up,
that that didn't go away,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and that we can use
that connection.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.180 align:middle line:90%
And the fifth is that awareness.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Because the veils between
our multi-dimensionality

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:84%
are thinner, that we can be
aware of that multi-dimensional

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the
law of electricity.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Electricity has always
been on this planet.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:84%
It took someone to figure
out how to harness it.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Now, it works the same--

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And distribute it.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.105 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --all
over the world.

00:08:30.105 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, the law of attraction,
the law of manifestation

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.159 align:middle line:84%
that people call it is
always working as well--

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:90%
has always been working.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:84%
We have what we have because
of how we think and speak.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
If we change our minds,
we change our reality.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.320 align:middle line:84%
We change the
trajectory of our life.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And now, science is
aligning with that.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Joe Dispenza is talking
about-- and as THEO

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
has been talking about
laying new neural pathways

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:84%
in our brain,
changing our minds,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:84%
so it changes how
we experience life.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:90%
So all of this is coming forth.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And THEO told us a long time
ago there were 12 dimensions.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of years
ago in "USA Today,"

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.980 align:middle line:84%
we read in the science
section that science has now

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:84%
discovered there are 11
dimensions about the Earth.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:90%
And Marcus asked about it.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And THEO said, well,
they just didn't ask us.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.020 align:middle line:90%
They'll find the 12th.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.343 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:28.343 --> 00:09:28.503 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.503 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean, that was--

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That was fun.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so interesting
about channeled work.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I too have had access
to it for a lot of years

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and watched what
was being told then

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and just now starting
to come into awareness

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:84%
of the world of
science, for example.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It's exciting to see
these things become

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:84%
known and manifest other than
in small esoteric circles.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And another thing is
a lot of people see what you do.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.630 align:middle line:90%
And they think, God--

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.188 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how did that happen?

00:09:58.188 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, you went through a
really painful situation

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:90%
around the birth of a child.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You said,
please, let my child live.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll do whatever you want.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.220 align:middle line:90%
And boom.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, you're
working for us now, OK?

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.747 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Exactly.

00:10:09.747 --> 00:10:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a
funny journey, too.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
interesting in that--

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and this is where I
just start laughing.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.640 align:middle line:90%
When I first read your book--

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.973 align:middle line:84%
I think before we ever knew
each other, I read the book,

00:10:19.973 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
before I knew you, of
course, and talking

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:84%
about even playing with the
Ouija board, which is how I

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:90%
started listening to guidance.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I was just playing
with the Ouija board,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and these weird things
started happening.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.540 align:middle line:84%
There's no one path for us
all that has to be taken.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
There are a thousand paths
to this vertical integration

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
of learning to come
into companionship

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and integrate with
the voice of the soul.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well--
and what THEO says

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
and what's been my
own experience--

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:84%
it will come to you in a
way that's psychologically

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and emotionally comfortable.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's not,
you'll just shut it down.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:90%
You'll become afraid.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:90%
And we learn differently.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.610 align:middle line:84%
The people learn either
visually or auditorily.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So typically, it's
been my experience

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
that when you open up,
it will come in the way

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:90%
that you learn best.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
People that are visionary
will see visions.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:90%
They will be clairvoyant.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:84%
People that are
auditory learners

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
will get inner mind
messages and clairaudience.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- and like I
said, over these years

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing the work,
and participating with people,

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and mentoring people, I've
been watching that to be true.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And then it blossoms in to
all of the other senses.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.488 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was my
own experience of it.

00:11:39.488 --> 00:11:41.155 align:middle line:84%
I was just playing
with the Ouija board.

00:11:41.155 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It was just play.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:90%
And things started happening.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And then it said go do
this and go do this.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And it kept becoming a
little more streamlined

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:90%
until finally, it was just--

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I was comfortable with
listening, seeing,

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:90%
or whatever was brought up.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't probably
have felt comfortable

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.175 align:middle line:84%
if some vision had just
blasted itself center

00:11:59.175 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:90%
view without any warning.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So Ouija board is something
we knew about at the time.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.538 align:middle line:90%
I did automatic writing.

00:12:06.538 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I did
after the Ouija board

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.810 align:middle line:90%
said go do automatic writing.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And then
trance spontaneously.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That
was interesting.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
But I had phenomena
happening internally--

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --externally as
we were sitting here talking

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:90%
if spirit wanted to speak.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:84%
If the angels wanted
to talk, my chair

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:84%
would physically shake as if
some very large person was

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:84%
shaking me to say, I
need to talk to you now.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So I had to learn
from those experiences

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that I could say, no, we have
an appointment at 10 o'clock.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk then.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Because our willpower-- and
this is-- a lot of people

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
are afraid something is
going to take them over.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, I didn't have a mentor.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have somebody
to tell me it was OK.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I had an angelic presence
that was teaching me.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that
I, my willpower, my soul

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:90%
was in control of this.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.210 align:middle line:90%
And then I set the rules.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:90%
And that was--

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.843 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was good
information to have.

00:13:12.843 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --very powerful.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:90%
And so I teach others that, too.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, THEO said,
you're the courageous one.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:90%
You took a body.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:90%
We didn't.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that is so true.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times we
get tripped up over that.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we give so much
credit to the other realms.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
oh, no, you guys

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:84%
are doing it with sweat
and blood down there.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yeah.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And they also encourage us
to say this is your life.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's an honor and
privilege for them

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.020 align:middle line:90%
as well as us to work together.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But there are precious
moments of life,

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:58.800 align:middle line:84%
they told me, that you give
up in allowing us to speak.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:90%
And we appreciate that.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Because these moments
will never come again.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the value
of those moments--

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.177 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and
that these moments

00:14:10.177 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:90%
should be self-directed.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
really the key.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So that said, I think that's a
wonderful primer for us to kind

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.910 align:middle line:84%
of get in the mood to bring the
THEO group in to talk about all

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
these kind of massive
questions from the helicopter

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.642 align:middle line:90%
bird's-eye view about society--

00:14:26.642 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:84%
where we've been, where we're
headed, and some of the stuff

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:90%
coming up right now.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And as--

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Sure.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --I said
earlier, some of it is--

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.753 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring up
a couple subjects that

00:14:33.753 --> 00:14:34.963 align:middle line:90%
are scary for people.

00:14:34.963 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what's
going to happen--

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and get THEO's
point of view on it.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I know THEO is ordered
toward not panicking, not

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.572 align:middle line:90%
going into fear.

00:14:43.572 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I'm going
to bring these topics up.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:90%
They'll tell us how not to be--

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.980 align:middle line:84%
go into fear patterns
over these things

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.400 align:middle line:84%
or what we can do
to ameliorate them.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Great.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's sound OK?

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Absolutely.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.868 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
I'll see you later.

00:14:56.868 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: OK,
we'll talk later.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:90%
It is the beginning, is it not?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us here today, THEO.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
As you already know, I have
oodles of questions for you.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And I want to start
at a place we've

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.570 align:middle line:84%
been before, just
to kind of move

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.615 align:middle line:90%
into right now and next year.

00:15:33.615 --> 00:15:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Several years ago
when I talked to you,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
you spoke of the
changes that would

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
be coming up in the world
between the years of 2016

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:90%
and 2020.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And indeed-- and we started
seeing massive shifts

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:84%
politically around the
world beginning in 2016.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But when I spoke with
you recently off camera,

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:84%
you said, oh, but
wait till 2020 comes.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday, I had another
guest that said, oh,

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
but wait till 2020
comes in terms

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:90%
of a shift in consciousness.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us what the year
2020, which is interesting--

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:84%
2020 as our producer
pointed out--

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:84%
20/20 vision-- what
2020 is, what it means.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And what can come from
it as a result of that?

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's a combination
of awakened beings using

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:90%
the gifts that they have--

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:84%
their voice and in some
places, their vote, but mostly,

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.550 align:middle line:90%
the voice in the world.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:40.070 align:middle line:84%
These changes come by the
people, not the politicians

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.256 align:middle line:90%
as has been proven.

00:16:42.256 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And so what you are witnessing
is this awakened voice

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
coming forth to what's
appropriate for the human

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:90%
species on the planet.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:84%
It is not only the
country of which

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:84%
you live, but
throughout the world,

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.531 align:middle line:90%
an equalization for humanity.

00:17:02.531 --> 00:17:04.339 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
the frequencies

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:84%
of our being able
to connect more

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.630 align:middle line:84%
closely into the fifth
dimensional level

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.079 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that's
allowing this desire in us

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:90%
to express itself now?

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes,
it is a recognition

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:84%
of the divine essence that
each and every one of you are.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And in that expression,
an awareness of love,

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
what is the truth universally
of unconditional love,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:90%
so centered awareness.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When we think of
that, of unconditional love,

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:84%
we can kind of take it in a
lot of times on a feeling level

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and definitely on a
sentimental level.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But when we think of
how love is the kind

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
of universal-based
energy field that's

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
going to operate under our
systems and institutions,

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
ultimately we start
thinking of, how

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:84%
do you get this type of
unconditional love merged

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.040 align:middle line:84%
with the basis for, say,
a new economic system?

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Because it can and will happen.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
that a little bit.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.690 align:middle line:84%
We just skimmed through
politics really briefly.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I know you said 2020 should
be a wonderful year of even

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:90%
more upheaval, right?

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: One could
think of it as upheaval.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.898 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Change, progression?

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That is a
preference, isn't it?

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We prefer to see the
change, the up-leveling, if you

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:84%
would, of consciousness
bringing this change

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
for the good for all and
the ability for the apathy

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.920 align:middle line:90%
to diminish.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: In that sense,
of each person taking

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
responsibility for their
own life experience

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and that in the recognition
of beliefs about themselves

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%
that are untrue, that
they are not worthy,

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.700 align:middle line:84%
that there's not enough
of them, that one

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:90%
is greater than another.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:90%
One is not greater than another.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Each of you is equal
in that divine essence.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And experiencing it and
bringing it forth with that love

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:90%
allows ease of grace in life.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
You walk through an
invisible barrier

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:84%
that you may have been
experiencing, because you

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.260 align:middle line:90%
didn't think you were enough.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that, it's not
conceit or narcissism.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:49.220 align:middle line:84%
It is a feeling of
centeredness that

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:84%
allows for one to
know they can handle

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:90%
whatever comes their way.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And whatever comes their way
changes with that knowledge.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.955 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is so true.

00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, from
what you just said,

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that sets the platform
for the question

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.170 align:middle line:90%
that I am asking, which is--

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and how is that as you see it
going to be expressing itself

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.595 align:middle line:84%
in the new kind of economies
that will be given birth to

00:20:13.595 --> 00:20:14.408 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:20:14.408 --> 00:20:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the things
people are most fearful about

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:84%
is this thing that
I'm not worthy enough.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to have enough.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:90%
How can I get more?

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Because of that anxiety.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:84%
But the new economy
that we're going

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:84%
to be giving birth to with
this new consciousness

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:90%
looks very different.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.918 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
it a little bit?

00:20:30.918 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It does.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Money-- whatever the currency
might be that is used to pay

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:90%
for goods and services--

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:90%
it's just a tool, isn't it?

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.250 align:middle line:84%
It has no power
in and of itself,

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
but it has power in the
beliefs of humankind, yes?

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:90%
So you begin with beliefs.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
What are your
beliefs about money?

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Money will not go
where it's not loved.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:90%
That sounds amazing, doesn't it?

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:90%
But what we mean by that--

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
when one realizes that they
are worthy of an abundant life,

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:84%
that they deserve to have
the life they wish to live

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of
money they desire,

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
it's different for
everybody, isn't it?

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So whatever that
is, that one can achieve it

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:84%
by making it welcome,
taking it inside

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:90%
to see if they could let it in.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:42.975 align:middle line:84%
Because those who do not have
money aren't letting it in.

00:21:42.975 --> 00:21:43.775 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:21:43.775 --> 00:21:44.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And that
not letting it in

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:84%
is the belief
structure that they

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.657 align:middle line:90%
have that creates the barrier.

00:21:51.657 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That there are all
these steps that have to be

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.790 align:middle line:90%
attained and so forth--

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:84%
the beliefs of what
it takes in order

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
to be able to draw
that into one's life.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
condition-based thinking.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Common thinking.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
We're encouraging you all to
step out of common thinking,

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:14.480 align:middle line:84%
because you're working
with infinite resources,

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.351 align:middle line:90%
infinite energy.

00:22:17.351 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about some of those systems

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:90%
that will support this.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you and I
talked at another time

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:84%
about the emergence of
things like cryptocurrencies,

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:84%
where you're talking about
kind of digital currencies

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that are being
created to support

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:84%
something that supports
humanity, the Earth

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:90%
culture on some level.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's more
of a consciousness

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:84%
behind the origins of a lot of
these new-- and there are many

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
of them, this explosion
of digital currencies.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same time,
it's kind of scary for people.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.592 align:middle line:84%
Because they see
the grandpa of them

00:22:53.592 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:84%
all-- bitcoin doing this
wild ride up and down.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is
afraid to tiptoe in.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
They're not quite sure
what to do with this story.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Where does that--

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's
because it's dark.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.858 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell me about that.

00:23:04.858 --> 00:23:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There's nothing that
can be followed or verified,

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:90%
but that will change.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.980 align:middle line:90%
It will evolve in its--

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and mature in a way
that will be less scary.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But in this time,
there's no way.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And the bitcoin was
developed in darkness,

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:84%
so that there
could be those that

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:84%
wish to manipulate money to
use in a way that could not

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.020 align:middle line:90%
be followed.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.290 align:middle line:84%
However, there will
be regulations.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, if you think about
it, it's already digital money,

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: If you walk into one
of your institutions of money--

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:84%
a bank-- and you have
$100,000 in the bank

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and you make a demand on
the bank for that $100,000,

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
they could not give it
to you in that moment,

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:84%
because everything
is digital, yes?

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:13.970 align:middle line:84%
The money can be gotten out
of storage, you might say.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:90%
But it is not readily available.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's just
a transition to a more

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:90%
digital economy, let's say?

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:90%
So you don't have the--

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.802 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --units
of currency sitting

00:24:25.802 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:84%
in vaults
theoretically available

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:84%
if you give them
some time to prepare.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So what does that
look like when you

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.480 align:middle line:84%
have this young generation
that is adopting this more

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.430 align:middle line:90%
collaborative mindset?

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:84%
What does the new currencies of
the future-- what do they look

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:90%
like?

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:90%
And how do they operate for us?

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They will
operate with technology

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:84%
just like everything is
going to technology, yes?

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.310 align:middle line:90%
It already is, isn't it?

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:90%
You use your telephone.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:00.140 align:middle line:84%
You use your computer
to do your banking,

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
to pay for goods and
services now, yes?

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: There's no exchange
for them for the actual money

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:90%
very often, is there?

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Less as
the days go on.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it becomes more
globally effective, yes?

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So then there is
not these exchanges

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:84%
that happen when you
travel the globe.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.700 align:middle line:84%
There will come
about an exchange

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that works for all countries and
all beings on that world, yes?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:25:40.295 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that something that you see?

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like to get
into time frames too much.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it's
very difficult to image

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:84%
how humanity is going to respond
at any given time to something,

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.540 align:middle line:84%
to give hard time frames
on much of anything.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:84%
But is this something that is
in our relatively near future?

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Not in its
full concept, not 2020.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, 2030, 2040.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Are we looking maybe
at another generation?

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Another
generation-- 2050, yes?

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So around 2050, we
should be seeing

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.550 align:middle line:84%
what you're calling is that
kind of a globally agreed upon--

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Exchange.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.617 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --unit of exchange?

00:26:22.617 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And so people don't
need to read into that--

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:31.635 align:middle line:84%
a cabal that is globally
dominating a currency,

00:26:31.635 --> 00:26:32.435 align:middle line:90%
so to speak?

00:26:32.435 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's the
greater fear, isn't it?

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:35.015 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is the fear.

00:26:35.015 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:90%
That's why I bring it up.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:90%
It's just like in the--

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:90%
when the century changed.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And there was such great fear
about everything shutting down

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.060 align:middle line:90%
from 1999 to 2000.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Everything went
on as usual, yes?

00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:84%
But there was this
great buildup for years

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:84%
that it was going to be
devastating for the world.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Understand this.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:12.080 align:middle line:84%
It's evolving as we're
sitting here moment to moment.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's just as
your child would

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:90%
grow from infancy to adulthood.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the growth
until you go away from them

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:90%
and come back.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they've grown 6 inches, yes?

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
doing it every day.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing them every day.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:90%
It's no different than this.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Just a few years
ago, you did not

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:90%
have access to the internet.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:90%
That's been relatively recent.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's just
expected, isn't it?

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's normal.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:90%
It will be like that.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's a shift just
simply born out of this shift

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness--

00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where
the people who now

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.890 align:middle line:84%
seek to control, or
dominate, and manipulate

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.600 align:middle line:84%
markets and that kind of
thing will simply what?

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of a
passing of an age?

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:90%
People dying out?

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:84%
New consciousness
replacing that?

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Really, it happens
more simply in that way?

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: And understand this.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:84%
With this energy, this
vibration that you're

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:26.370 align:middle line:84%
living in now, all of that
hidden underground manipulation

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:90%
is surfacing--

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --yes?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's like
a virus in the body

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:84%
or an illness in the body
that a fever burns out.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Then the body releases on a
cellular level that old energy,

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:90%
yes?

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's
what's happening now.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so I agree.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.490 align:middle line:90%
That's my observation as well.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's lovely to think
that these things just

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.240 align:middle line:84%
happen as an organic expression
of an advancing consciousness.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:90%
So it just--

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I think for our listeners and
our viewers, that just takes

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:84%
the fear out of the notion
that a fight has to be had

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and all of the rumors
of mass arrests

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:84%
that are going to take place,
the cabal is going to jail,

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.030 align:middle line:84%
they're all going
to be taken down,

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.360 align:middle line:90%
which I think is not true.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
It's fantasy to make people
feel like they have more control

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:90%
in the moment.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't really even
need to think that way.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: No, but
you're witnessing

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:84%
people that are
acting that way now,

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:84%
that are in authoritative
positions, yes?

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.397 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, of course.

00:29:34.397 --> 00:29:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Watching children
taken from their mothers--

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --yes?

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's where the fear lies.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And there are those
fearmongers that

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:49.550 align:middle line:84%
want to control the masses, is
being historically passed along

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:90%
for centuries, yes?

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:84%
It won't work anymore
with consciousness.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked about
this many, many times.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But certainly on
Earth, the majority

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
of the news that's
disseminated is based on fear

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and to create fear
in the human species.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.758 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
addictive, and it gains money.

00:30:09.758 --> 00:30:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And then that gains
advertisers through the money.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.530 align:middle line:84%
That supports the more
negative news the next day.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.455 align:middle line:90%
It's a really broken cycle.

00:30:17.455 --> 00:30:19.880 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: But it's
important for everyone

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.410 align:middle line:10%
to know that you're in
contact with your higher

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:10%
power, your source.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Go inside and ask if it's true.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.740 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:90%
All of you know.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:39.230 align:middle line:84%
However, just in
limiting beliefs,

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:44.960 align:middle line:84%
you've accepted others'
beliefs or words rather than

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom of your knowing.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So we would encourage each and
every one, when a fear comes,

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:84%
go inside and ask if it's true
and where it's coming from.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more with that.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some
other trends that

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.600 align:middle line:84%
are coming up that
for a lot of people

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.150 align:middle line:84%
it appears on the surface
to be very hopeful

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.750 align:middle line:90%
and they're very happy about.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is the
legalization of marijuana.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So the population has access
not just to alcohol, but also

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.080 align:middle line:90%
to marijuana.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.990 align:middle line:84%
In each of these things,
it has a relaxing effect

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.720 align:middle line:84%
for people that are just
running too fast and fearful

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and just want to drop
out and soothe the mind

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.350 align:middle line:90%
for a little bit of time.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:32.290 align:middle line:84%
But what does that look like
long term in terms of mass use?

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:84%
We kind of know where
alcohol goes because we've

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.250 align:middle line:90%
lived these cultures already.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.790 align:middle line:90%
We've come out of that age.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Then we went into
the espresso age

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:84%
where everyone's jacked
up on loads of caffeine.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.150 align:middle line:84%
We kind of see
where that's going.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:90%
We're moving way too fast.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're looking at
the age of mass consumption

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:90%
of marijuana.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.480 align:middle line:90%
Where does that age lead?

00:31:53.480 --> 00:32:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It has its own
level, just as alcohol has.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.290 align:middle line:84%
There will be those
who overuse out

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:84%
of the limiting
beliefs we speak about,

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.250 align:middle line:84%
the feelings that
are uncomfortable.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:15.820 align:middle line:84%
When beings learn how to
navigate their feelings,

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:20.540 align:middle line:84%
they'll be less
abusive of the things

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:24.080 align:middle line:90%
that they use to not feel.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.930 align:middle line:90%


00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's a matter of
recognizing, what

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:90%
feelings are they avoiding?

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's interesting.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And I bring it up, because
after World War II when

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.590 align:middle line:84%
the economy started
cranking up and people

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:84%
had to start caring mortgages,
and credit card debt,

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and all that kind of thing,
this need to kind of relax--

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.310 align:middle line:90%
the cocktail generation.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.250 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It took the soulless
in that way.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.910 align:middle line:90%
And some people overindulged.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Some people didn't,
just as you said.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.640 align:middle line:84%
But then the need to have to
now really keep up with all

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.530 align:middle line:90%
that debt cranked us up.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's where Starbucks
and all these coffee

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.040 align:middle line:90%
shops around the world--

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.950 align:middle line:84%
not in the way that it was
originally used in Italy where

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:84%
you have a little
espresso in the morning,

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.300 align:middle line:90%
maybe a shot in the afternoon.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.510 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the culture.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Here, give me a
quadruple venti--

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.430 align:middle line:84%
four shots of espresso
to get going and four

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:26.160 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day, just to
keep up with the pace of life.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:26.960 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I can certainly understand
why each of these things came.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're so wound up
now, that marijuana seems

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:90%
like the perfect antidote.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It is in many ways.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.940 align:middle line:90%
The plant itself or plants--

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:45.150 align:middle line:84%
different varieties have
great medicinal usage.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: So some are there
to change the mind, truly.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
They are there to assist
the body as a supplement

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to relieve pain,
to assist those who

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:10.270 align:middle line:90%
have seizures of the brain--

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:12.239 align:middle line:90%
calm.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So the medicinal aspects of it
are very strong and necessary

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.750 align:middle line:84%
in certain illnesses
such as cancer--

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.969 align:middle line:90%
very beneficial.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.250 align:middle line:84%
What you're speaking
about is that

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:32.210 align:middle line:84%
which makes people
feel differently, have

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.969 align:middle line:90%
an effect on the psyche, yes?

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.370 align:middle line:90%
The calming effect.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:38.960 align:middle line:90%
That's not bad.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.730 align:middle line:84%
It is organic, dependent
upon how it's used, yes?

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:50.239 align:middle line:84%
And there will be those who
overuse and those who do not.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:55.130 align:middle line:84%
What needs to be done is
the looking internally

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and the changing of the
beliefs that we spoke about.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.230 align:middle line:84%
If everyone did
that, they would not

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:07.760 align:middle line:84%
feel the need to cover
over uncomfortable feelings

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.060 align:middle line:90%
about the self.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
was brought to my attention

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.930 align:middle line:84%
relatively recently is from
the world of neuroscience.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I've always
kind of gone along

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:22.850 align:middle line:84%
with the standard
story that this is--

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.160 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the toxic
effects, better than alcohol,

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.980 align:middle line:84%
for example, they say,
and that there were really

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.980 align:middle line:90%
no long-term effects.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But the more I'm starting to
look into it and especially

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:84%
after coming into contact
with one neuroscientist, which

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.385 align:middle line:84%
was talking about
how this suppresses

00:35:37.385 --> 00:35:39.590 align:middle line:84%
the dopamine cycle
in the brain, this

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:40.715 align:middle line:90%
is why-- the overuse of it.

00:35:40.715 --> 00:35:42.090 align:middle line:84%
This is why I'm
talking about it.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If it suppresses the
dopamine cycle in the brain

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and that is our level of
discernment, our get up and go,

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.080 align:middle line:84%
our feel-good chemical,
our sharpness,

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and a focus in terms
of our daily hours--

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:58.430 align:middle line:84%
if we start dulling that
down en masse too often,

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:00.860 align:middle line:84%
that has an effect
upon society, too.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.600 align:middle line:90%
You talked about apathy.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
overcome apathy, so we

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:84%
need that crispness, that
sharpness of mind to navigate.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And my concern
is, is it possible

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.250 align:middle line:84%
that that's going to be dulled
down more en masse with this?

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That was the
concern about alcohol as well,

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:18.950 align:middle line:90%
anything--

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that is true.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.658 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: --that alters--

00:36:20.658 --> 00:36:21.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:36:21.575 --> 00:36:22.375 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:22.375 --> 00:36:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --the
state of being, yes?

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And look what's
happened in society.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.460 align:middle line:90%
It continues to expand.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And there
is that expansion to--

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.610 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So not
to be too concerned

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:35.070 align:middle line:90%
about this dopamine cycle issue?

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
that's good to know.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought, don't
want some kind of soma,

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:44.930 align:middle line:84%
basically putting everybody into
an apathetic or over-relaxed

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:84%
state where you're not really
engaged with your own life.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:48.747 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It's
already happened,

00:36:48.747 --> 00:36:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't by
substance abuse.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.630 align:middle line:90%
Please, go ahead.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is that others
have given their power away--

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:57.855 --> 00:36:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely true.

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.625 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --and are not
believing that they had any.

00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very true.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And so it lulled
them to sleep into the apathy

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:84%
that others would
take care of them.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.715 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have to do anything.

00:37:11.715 --> 00:37:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a little
weed, a glass of wine.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing compared to
the growth and expansion

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.250 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness if
we take responsibility

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.110 align:middle line:84%
for our own integration and
get rid of those beliefs.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And the energy that is about
the planet now inspires people--

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.627 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --rather
than take away from them.

00:37:31.627 --> 00:37:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's inspirational.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, before we get
into some of that

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and what our potentials
are and also,

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.558 align:middle line:84%
some of the ancient past and
what's being brought forward,

00:37:44.558 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to
one other thing that

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:84%
is probably one of
the primary concerning

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.388 align:middle line:90%
things for our audience--

00:37:51.388 --> 00:37:53.180 align:middle line:84%
people that you're
speaking with right now.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's the introduction
of a technology called

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:59.090 align:middle line:84%
5G, which is very
powerful radiation

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that'll boost our signals
on our cell phone devices

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to make us connected even
faster, so as if we're not--

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:90%
it's not fast enough.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But the effects
that this is said

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to have on our bodies
and our brains--

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:90%
it sounds very dystopian.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about this--

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.090 align:middle line:90%
what the--

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: There are many--

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.155 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --truth is?

00:38:20.155 --> 00:38:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --things that are
happening in your world that do

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.540 align:middle line:90%
affect you physically--

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:90%
chemicals.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But what you're speaking about
is vibrational frequencies.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.365 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
vibrational frequencies.

00:38:33.365 --> 00:38:35.266 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They're
around you anyway.

00:38:35.266 --> 00:38:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this boost
in those-- with those--

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.180 align:middle line:84%
the increase in the
frequencies in the microwaves

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and the number of
the towers and such--

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.070 align:middle line:84%
do you see it, if you
look down the road a bit,

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:84%
as having a significant
effect on us?

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something that will be
ameliorated by something else?

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It will be
ameliorated by other things.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's also that the human
physical body is adjusting.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's the next question
I was going to get to.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about our
adaptability as a mechanism,

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:11.350 align:middle line:90%
as a bioelectric mechanism.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, you are.

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:15.140 align:middle line:90%
And understand this.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.720 align:middle line:90%
The human body is miraculous.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.050 align:middle line:84%
It is constantly
trying to achieve

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:26.880 align:middle line:84%
its homeostasis, its balance,
its full health spectrum.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And as you become
aware of that, you

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.960 align:middle line:84%
can assist it through diet and
all the good health habits,

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.870 align:middle line:90%
yes?

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Sleep, hydration,
exercise, and listening.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.480 align:middle line:84%
The body will tell you
exactly what it needs

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and where it's out of
balance if you pay attention.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And that is why integrative
medicine is becoming

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:58.850 align:middle line:90%
so well known and evolving now.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Because people are
realizing to have medicine--

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:09.440 align:middle line:84%
the body, mind, spirit in
its truth of taking all

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.650 align:middle line:90%
into account those aspects--

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.180 align:middle line:90%
emotions.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And so
this is another place

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:25.280 align:middle line:84%
that each person can
take their own counsel,

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:33.110 align:middle line:84%
find collaborative
medical assistance,

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:38.335 align:middle line:84%
and work together in concert
for optimum health, yes?

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think everyone listening
will agree with that.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.270 align:middle line:84%
As far as the body's
ability to adapt,

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:48.440 align:middle line:84%
maybe you can comment on one
other challenge of the past,

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and that was
radiation poisoning.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:54.740 align:middle line:84%
We look back to
World War II and what

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.620 align:middle line:90%
we did in Japan, for example.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, you hear people today
talking about radiation

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.150 align:middle line:84%
poisoning, saying,
oh, just a little

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:05.210 align:middle line:84%
bit of this particular element
or that particular element

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and it lasts--

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.780 align:middle line:90%
its half life is 500,000 years.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.300 align:middle line:84%
But then you look at the
reality that Hiroshima--

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.590 align:middle line:84%
60 years later is
a thriving city

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:20.570 align:middle line:84%
alive with human beings whose
bodies transcended whatever

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.050 align:middle line:90%
that toxic radiation was.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard from
other people as well

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that have been
exposed to radiation

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that in one extreme case
said, oh, I was excited

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.160 align:middle line:90%
when I heard about Fukushima.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Because she'd been exposed to
radiation throughout her life.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's like her being was
almost like craving radiation

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.600 align:middle line:84%
exposure, which is hard
for us to understand.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.426 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:41:44.426 --> 00:41:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: The body does
adjust to its environment.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.610 align:middle line:90%
That's how all animals--

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and humans are animals--

00:41:54.860 --> 00:42:00.410 align:middle line:90%
have evolved to the environment.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And radiation is
used in positive ways

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.910 align:middle line:90%
for certain diseases, yes?

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But what assists one who
has had radiation is oxygen.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Oxygen-- that is why deep
breathing is so important.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Most humans breathe
shallowly, just enough

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.910 align:middle line:90%
to keep themselves alive.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So if one remembers to take
deep breaths exhaling audibly,

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:38.500 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the toxins,
disease cannot live

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.380 align:middle line:90%
in an oxygenated form.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
any and all ways

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:46.270 align:middle line:84%
in which to oxygenate
the body is really

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:84%
kind of the antidote to a
whole lot of these toxins.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And would you say even
frequency exposure, even

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:53.800 align:middle line:90%
radiation exposure?

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oxygen, oxygen,
oxygen, and hydrogen--

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oxygen?

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:42:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's good.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.230 align:middle line:90%
That's simple, direct.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.105 align:middle line:84%
There are technologies
out there that address

00:43:03.105 --> 00:43:05.650 align:middle line:84%
just that, so if we do
some of these things.

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:09.303 align:middle line:84%
And again, what you said
earlier, listen to the body.

00:43:09.303 --> 00:43:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Just live in the
healthiest manner

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.970 align:middle line:90%
we know to do as our body is--

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.235 align:middle line:84%
our mind-body complex
is directing us to do.

00:43:15.235 --> 00:43:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It is
also important--

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:19.730 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:21.625 align:middle line:84%
So if you're doing
something that you

00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:26.410 align:middle line:84%
know is probably not the
best for your health,

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:29.920 align:middle line:84%
don't add to it by thinking
about it as being negative.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So if we're-- and if these
things are being rolled out

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and happening anyway, then
there's no point in going

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:40.970 align:middle line:84%
into any kind of debilitating
fear over it, anger--

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It just gives it--

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.053 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --over it.

00:43:43.053 --> 00:43:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --more
power in your body.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Because you're agreeing that
it's going to be negative, yes?

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, right.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:55.130 align:middle line:90%
No, that makes total sense.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I always think
back to Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Life is happening.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bodies adapt.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's correct.

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:08.612 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the wave of people
they thought was going to be

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:10.840 align:middle line:84%
dying of radiation
exposure after the accident

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.570 align:middle line:90%
at Fukushima--

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that it's panning
out the way it was feared.

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Most fears aren't.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Fear and faith ask the
same thing of you--

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.520 align:middle line:84%
to believe in something
that's unseen.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes-- and to give
your credibility and devotion

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.780 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So we encourage
you to have faith.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.750 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
about religion.

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:42.070 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about faith,
belief in the highest good.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And belief in our
own genius, our own body,

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:46.180 align:middle line:90%
our own soul's genius--

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that we chose these
incarnations at this time.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We didn't come here
to be debilitated and die

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.390 align:middle line:90%
from toxic exposure.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:59.965 align:middle line:84%
We came here to obviously
learn to expand and transcend.

00:44:59.965 --> 00:45:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's correct.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you've
chosen to embody

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:04.810 align:middle line:90%
in this time of grand change.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It's an exquisite
time to be alive.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I think people will
enjoy hearing that.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I would like to take us back a
little bit, way back, actually.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.310 align:middle line:90%
And there's a reason for that.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.160 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come up later on
some future shows with Gaia,

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.480 align:middle line:90%
so I want to bring it up now.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is to take us back
into the golden ages of what

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.350 align:middle line:84%
was the great
continent of Atlantis.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you can talk to us
a little bit about Atlantis

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and what the life
in its highest times

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:41.050 align:middle line:84%
represented at that time,
what it looked like.

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It was not
unlike your world today--

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:53.200 align:middle line:84%
refined, beings using
their personal power

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.760 align:middle line:84%
not from fear or
aggression, but in that

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:04.150 align:middle line:84%
knowing of the divine
essence in each one

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.030 align:middle line:90%
and the evolution of that.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:14.200 align:middle line:84%
The Atlanteans were about
education, and awareness,

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:24.580 align:middle line:84%
That group of beings
were supported

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and supportive of
raising consciousness.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the same
time, they were believed--

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:36.400 align:middle line:90%
because all we have is what?

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.980 align:middle line:84%
The remnants of stories,
really, believed

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.170 align:middle line:84%
to have had also very
advanced technologies--

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --advanced
architecture,

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.360 align:middle line:90%
advanced agriculture.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you comment
on all of those things--

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.660 align:middle line:90%
the technology?

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And I specifically
would like to have

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.100 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the
technologies that

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:58.150 align:middle line:84%
were driven by what was referred
to as the Great Crystal--

00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:59.380 align:middle line:90%
crystal technologies.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Everything
is crystalline

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.710 align:middle line:84%
broken down into
form, has geometrics

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:08.770 align:middle line:90%
to it as crystals do, yes?

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the thinkers
of that time--

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:17.260 align:middle line:84%
the awareness of that in the
crystalline form and those

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:21.460 align:middle line:84%
forms just like your
DNA have structure, yes?

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So they became
aware of structure

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:31.060 align:middle line:84%
from a vibrational
sense and began

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:37.870 align:middle line:84%
using it in buildings, in their
technology that up-leveled

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:44.620 align:middle line:84%
everything that then, in
turn, up-leveled awareness,

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:48.205 align:middle line:84%
and connectedness,
and understanding.

00:47:48.205 --> 00:47:50.880 align:middle line:90%


00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the Great
Crystal was not just

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:57.690 align:middle line:84%
a function of driving
technology of the day or maybe

00:47:57.690 --> 00:47:59.790 align:middle line:90%
transportation of the day.

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you would go into the
transportation of the day,

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.197 align:middle line:90%
I would appreciate it.

00:48:03.197 --> 00:48:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems it's very
important for us to understand

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.345 align:middle line:90%
flight is not new to this--

00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:10.145 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:48:10.145 --> 00:48:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --planet
of this last century.

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Flight has always been
there, which explains

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.150 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of anomalies.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you could explain
to us about the crystal

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of
technology and transportation

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:26.782 align:middle line:84%
devices of the day,
that would be one area.

00:48:26.782 --> 00:48:28.615 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, the
crystalline technology

00:48:28.615 --> 00:48:31.192 align:middle line:90%
is used today, isn't it?

00:48:31.192 --> 00:48:36.420 align:middle line:84%
A rediscovery of
it that occurred

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.010 align:middle line:84%
from those who had
been in Atlantis,

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:44.640 align:middle line:84%
for understand this-- the Earth
is one choice of experience.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And in those thousands
of years past,

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was a choice, just like
you are in this party today.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.010 align:middle line:90%
But, no, it's only one choice.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:49:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And so those beings
on this planet

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.400 align:middle line:90%
speak of aliens and flight.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's been always
for thousands,

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:13.050 align:middle line:84%
upon thousands, and thousands
of years in your linear time,

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
other universes.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:22.500 align:middle line:84%
There are those that are in
flight and come to this planet

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:27.630 align:middle line:90%
unseen with their technology.

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:31.110 align:middle line:90%
But you speak of aliens.

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that you are them.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.560 align:middle line:84%
You've just chosen a different
body and a different place

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:43.830 align:middle line:84%
to navigate from on
this Earth, rather than

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:50.550 align:middle line:84%
from another source,
or planet, or system.

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was like
this, only there

00:49:53.670 --> 00:50:01.500 align:middle line:84%
was this awareness
of that existence

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:06.030 align:middle line:90%
and using all that knowledge.

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As in collaboration
between visiting species

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and the people that lived
in Atlantis at the time,

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.940 align:middle line:84%
there was open communication
with other species.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:14.740 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.113 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --technology and
technological knowledge

00:50:17.113 --> 00:50:18.060 align:middle line:90%
was shared.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: That's correct,
but understand this.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
They also knew that they
were one and the same.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.990 align:middle line:90%


00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Because each had had experiences
in those other realms,

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:41.290 align:middle line:84%
those other places and
had come to the Earth

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:48.730 align:middle line:84%
to experience Earth, and that
it was necessary to collaborate

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:53.540 align:middle line:90%
for everybody's knowledge.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't an
us and them back then--

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: No.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --us versus them.

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And some of the human
species that existed--

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and I've read this and heard
this from other sources

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.090 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:06.080 align:middle line:90%
We were different.

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.700 align:middle line:90%
We were larger in stature.

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.290 align:middle line:90%
We lived longer in years.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak about
that, what are--

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:16.310 align:middle line:84%
as humans or even human
hybrids, our physical bodies

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.160 align:middle line:84%
were like, our states of
health, and our lifespans?

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.620 align:middle line:90%
And please just talk about that.

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They were
larger and of better health,

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.180 align:middle line:84%
better awareness of how
to maintain that as well.

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But that's what is evolving
now on this planet, isn't it?

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.010 align:middle line:90%


00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Understand this.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:43.330 align:middle line:84%
If you live to 90 in this
body with good health,

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:48.460 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of being
140 is very viable.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.020 align:middle line:90%


00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happened
on Atlantis, you see?

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So you're evolving
as human species

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to this higher
state of awareness--

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.220 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And when one recognizes one's
own divinity, if you would,

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:13.510 align:middle line:84%
alignment to source
energetically speaking,

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:18.190 align:middle line:84%
releasing beliefs that you
are not worthy of that,

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:23.860 align:middle line:84%
you release all of the emotional
blockages in the physical body.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:32.110 align:middle line:84%
The energy runs clear without
any blockage or disruption.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Then there can be full
spectrum of health,

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.080 align:middle line:84%
because there's no blockage
in the physical body.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
occurred in Atlantis.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.262 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
were the lifespans?

00:52:42.262 --> 00:52:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know it varied throughout
the many, many thousands

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.220 align:middle line:84%
of years' history of Atlantis,
but the general lifespans

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.140 align:middle line:90%
of Atlanteans at that time?

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.018 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Over 100.

00:52:52.018 --> 00:52:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sometimes
they talk of them

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:58.232 align:middle line:84%
living into the several hundreds
of years in the earlier phases.

00:52:58.232 --> 00:53:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It was possible
because they didn't

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:02.305 align:middle line:90%
have the emotional blockage.

00:53:02.305 --> 00:53:04.840 align:middle line:90%


00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when we speak
about these people-- and I

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:07.890 align:middle line:90%
bring this up.

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Because one interest
right now that's growing

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:14.530 align:middle line:84%
is these large statured-- would
appear to be human beings.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.510 align:middle line:90%
We call them giants, right?

00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Are being found in the
areas that could have easily

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:22.630 align:middle line:84%
been accessible to anyone
who had left Atlantis,

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:25.120 align:middle line:84%
especially prior to one
of the destructions, which

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.590 align:middle line:90%
were known about.

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:30.310 align:middle line:84%
It was understood
that it was unstable.

00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:33.550 align:middle line:84%
These bodies are being found
all over of all these varying

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:36.040 align:middle line:90%
heights rimming the Atlantic.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's been true.

00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:45.160 align:middle line:84%
They've already been found
and as a confirmation

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:51.940 align:middle line:84%
or affirmation of what
has been before, but also,

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:55.390 align:middle line:90%
an awareness of what will be.

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that we may start--

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:58.900 align:middle line:90%
again, we're seeing children.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.490 align:middle line:84%
The subsequent
generations of people

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:01.610 align:middle line:90%
are gaining in size again.

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Larger.

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Yes-- and have been in these
centuries most recently past.

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is a
marker of where we've been.

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And from whatever has happened
through our own belief

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.950 align:middle line:84%
systems, and tribal belief
systems, and so forth,

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:19.750 align:middle line:90%
we're now the size.

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're the length of lifespan
we are for various reasons that

00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:24.160 align:middle line:90%
have limited us.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now, we're
going to be expanding back

00:54:26.705 --> 00:54:30.760 align:middle line:84%
into these giant-sized
frames, ultimately, and also

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.290 align:middle line:90%
into these longer lifespans.

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's true.

00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Because not only are
you going to experience

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.640 align:middle line:84%
this fifth dimension, which is
a part of this consciousness

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:45.190 align:middle line:84%
shifting in awareness that
is coming forth releasing

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:49.330 align:middle line:84%
the limitedness of
the human experience,

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:55.600 align:middle line:84%
then it allows for that greater
expansion in each and everyone

00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:02.410 align:middle line:84%
perceiving and acting
in life differently

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:06.730 align:middle line:84%
from that centered point of
view that we spoke about--

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: --of
unconditional love.

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And moving into
the sixth dimensionary energy,

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:19.540 align:middle line:84%
you will see the larger form
and that collaboration amongst

00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:24.670 align:middle line:84%
humans on Earth and even
what you call aliens--

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:27.520 align:middle line:90%
friend.

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:31.052 align:middle line:84%
Aliens-- it's an interesting
road, isn't it-- we find that?

00:55:31.052 --> 00:55:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's used in
many ways here on Earth.

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But all as a means--

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Something other of.

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to
divide and separate.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But realizing that
you have all the same desired

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:45.365 align:middle line:90%
outcome for this universe.

00:55:45.365 --> 00:55:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well-- and
part of the reason

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:49.510 align:middle line:84%
I brought this up is
because I personally

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:53.740 align:middle line:84%
had had an unusual experience
a number of years ago

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:57.340 align:middle line:84%
in which I found
myself interacting

00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:58.510 align:middle line:90%
with someone on Earth.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, it was almost
like "Alice in Wonderland."

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I was back in what appeared
to be an Atlantean form.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was probably in the
neighborhood of 10 to 12 feet

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.870 align:middle line:90%
tall.

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
feelings of it.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And I remember-- I've had
other remembrances of life

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:20.080 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantis and even before of
this more perfected environment

00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.650 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our agriculture,
our understanding, our food

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:27.130 align:middle line:84%
consumption, how we were in
harmony with our environment

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:28.990 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our
support of our health

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:31.240 align:middle line:84%
through our food
supplies and such,

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and that it was
not unusual to be

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:36.330 align:middle line:84%
10 or 12 feet tall at
that time, from what

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing in my body
from that perspective.

00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Can you
imagine somebody

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:46.260 align:middle line:84%
in the early 1900s
or 1800s standing

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:51.070 align:middle line:84%
next to one of your
sports celebrities?

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, we were already 8
foot, 5", 6", almost--

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 9 feet tall.

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: They could
not imagine, yes?

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: But you take
it for granted, don't you?

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That it just is.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're headed
back that direction.

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're discovering
what has been.

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be
interesting to start

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.900 align:middle line:84%
getting some genetic testing
done on some of these bones

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that are now being
discovered around

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and see what we define by way
of human, human-hybrid, alien,

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.392 align:middle line:90%
and all this different DNA.

00:57:22.392 --> 00:57:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: It will
be interesting.

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:30.930 align:middle line:84%
But what is fascinating is
that your science is evolving

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:33.615 align:middle line:90%
to allow that to occur.

00:57:33.615 --> 00:57:34.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:34.415 --> 00:57:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It's time for it.

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:39.668 align:middle line:84%
And may I share another
little vision I had one time?

00:57:39.668 --> 00:57:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think
it's a unique vision.

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.543 align:middle line:84%
I think other people have
had the same thing going

00:57:43.543 --> 00:57:45.060 align:middle line:90%
into our future, OK?

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, this harmony
living with nature--

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:49.080 align:middle line:84%
what I saw as I
was in a little--

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.360 align:middle line:84%
almost like a little bubble,
a little dome house that

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.460 align:middle line:90%
could be easily transportable.

00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And you could transport
it to the area

00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:58.320 align:middle line:84%
you needed to be for the state
of your health in that moment

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and what you wish to
experience and consume

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.540 align:middle line:84%
from a given region
that had certain herbs

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.010 align:middle line:90%
and plants available.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:08.430 align:middle line:84%
It had a plasma screen,
no wires or electricity

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:11.250 align:middle line:90%
as we know it now, that was--

00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:13.440 align:middle line:84%
you could communicate
through to people

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.570 align:middle line:90%
really anywhere you wished.

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's coming.

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- it was actually
a very clean, very simple, very

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:24.840 align:middle line:84%
connected reality, but we
were definitely connected back

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.510 align:middle line:90%
with the land again.

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, as we said,
this is an exquisite planet.

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:38.160 align:middle line:84%
It is a privilege to be
human, to have the Earth

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:41.280 align:middle line:84%
suit, your Earth
body to navigate

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:46.500 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of this planet and
that full recognition of it.

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is coming in
the consciousness of humanity.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that vision
wasn't that far off of what

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.510 align:middle line:90%
we will know down the road?

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Correct.

00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was beautiful.

00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't the only
one that had that vision.

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Understand this.

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:10.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a poor mind or memory that
can only go backwards, yes?

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: You all
have the ability

00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:20.622 align:middle line:84%
to envision your future, to go
into the future self and know.

00:59:20.622 --> 00:59:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
some of that is

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.600 align:middle line:84%
possible by viewing
into our deep past

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the splendor
that existed before.

00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And many Atlanteans
are here now and Lumerians,

00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:33.375 align:middle line:90%
but are here now remembering.

00:59:33.375 --> 00:59:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's correct.

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And understand this-- what
the fifth dimensionary energy

00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:40.260 align:middle line:90%
or vibration does--

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:44.400 align:middle line:84%
frequency allows
you to recognize

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:48.210 align:middle line:84%
your multi-dimensionality,
so that you can

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:52.267 align:middle line:90%
move in all those directions.

00:59:52.267 --> 00:59:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it is.

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:56.040 align:middle line:84%
It's much more hopeful when
you can go into the deep past

00:59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and see how splendid it
once was technologically,

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.540 align:middle line:84%
before any corruption, and
competition, and weaponry,

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.100 align:middle line:90%
and all that sort of thing.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.110 align:middle line:84%
That's how we got in
this state we're in now--

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes.

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --but to see
that we can just as easily

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:12.990 align:middle line:90%
end our evolving past that.

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Because you're
changing your minds.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: And that's
where it changes,

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:20.790 align:middle line:84%
a new way of
thinking and changing

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:24.630 align:middle line:84%
the neural pathways in your
brain from the old ways

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
of thinking of limitation to
new creativity and expansion.

01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:33.840 align:middle line:90%
The old will not work.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, thank
you so much, THEO.

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And we very much all
appreciate your coming

01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:42.660 align:middle line:84%
through to share this
information with us.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.520 align:middle line:90%
And we wish you well.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come back and allow
Sheila to come back with us.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: We appreciate
the opportunity

01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:52.267 align:middle line:90%
to be of service onto you.

01:00:52.267 --> 01:00:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We are complete.

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: God's love onto you.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

>>REGINA: Good day.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:11.718 align:middle line:90%


01:01:11.718 --> 01:01:12.518 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Sheila.

01:01:12.518 --> 01:01:14.465 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Hi, Regina.

01:01:14.465 --> 01:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we've
been to Atlantis.

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:17.320 align:middle line:90%
We've been to the future.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.180 align:middle line:90%
We've been to technology.

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.507 align:middle line:90%
We've been through radiation.

01:01:22.507 --> 01:01:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Oh, boy.

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've been through a
spectrum and a little of which

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:26.650 align:middle line:90%
you remember, I know.

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Because that doesn't really
work that way for you.

01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:29.060 align:middle line:90%
You're gone.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.940 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm just letting
you know that's what--

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:31.090 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: Thank you.

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:33.330 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --we've been up
to since you've been gone.

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Well, I look forward
to hearing it and seeing it.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
want to thank you

01:01:36.995 --> 01:01:39.850 align:middle line:84%
for the chat we had at the
very beginning, the first part

01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:40.690 align:middle line:90%
of this show.

01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:42.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
helpful for people

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
to really understand,
whether we like it or not,

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.320 align:middle line:84%
we're expanding our
awareness and consciousness.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.445 align:middle line:84%
And it's going ultimately
in a very good direction.

01:01:49.445 --> 01:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think we can see it in
the eyes of these little people

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.830 align:middle line:90%
that are being born now.

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
These young people
just have a type

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
of awareness,
understanding, and light

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that I think the previous
generations didn't

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.840 align:middle line:90%
exhibit in that way.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: That's true.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, the
fear has taken over.

01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:12.185 align:middle line:84%
And we need to realize
we're more than that.

01:02:12.185 --> 01:02:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.110 align:middle line:90%
We are more than that.

01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're going in
a good direction.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.717 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: Yes, we are.

01:02:17.717 --> 01:02:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much,
Sheila, and happy birthday.

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GILLETTE: Oh,
thank you so much.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:21.580 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be with you.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We did this last year.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: We did.

01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can you believe that?

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Last time I saw you, it was
birthday celebration time.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GILLETTE: It was.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a great
birthday gift.

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For all of
us, thank you so much.
