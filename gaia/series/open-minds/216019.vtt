>>REGINA MEREDITH: For
the past few decades,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle line:84%
we've been hearing that humanity
is going to be transitioning

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.370 align:middle line:90%
But what does that mean?

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:10%
Maureen St. Germain
has been deconstructing

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:10%
the nature of what it means
to be multidimensional

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:10%
and is here to talk
about ascending

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:10%
into the fifth dimension
so we can understand

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.722 align:middle line:10%
what's happening to us better.

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN ST.
GERMAIN: Sounds good.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:90%
So welcome.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I've never interviewed
you before.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:10%
It's wonderful.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.448 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:44.448 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful to be here.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of all, for
those who don't already know

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:90%
you-- and many people do--

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:84%
let's talk a little
bit about how

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
you began receiving this
information, kind of your life

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:84%
journey that led you
to where you are now,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and talking about
multidimensionality because it's

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:84%
still a very confusing
subject for a lot of people

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes up to
interpretation too.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUREEN: Right.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think I was born awake,
because I remember things

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:10%
from my childhood.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:10%
I remember being
watched as a child.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Watched by whom?

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.873 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: Benevolence
and non-benevolence.

00:01:16.873 --> 00:01:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
that look like?

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.082 align:middle line:84%
You mean when you were
a little kid in bed,

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:90%
you could see beings?

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Or did they come in dream time?

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: No, I
could feel them.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:90%
I could sense them.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.963 align:middle line:84%
And I could sense that
they were there in the sky.

00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, yeah.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: And we
didn't watch TV.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't influenced by
some other kind of environment.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUREEN: So that
was the beginning.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:10%
And then growing up,
I grew up Catholic.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:10%
But I very quickly went beyond
what Catholicism could give me.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And meditation
became a key thing.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned the
Merkabah from Drunvalo

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and began teaching
it right away.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.305 align:middle line:84%
And I was invited all
over the world to teach.

00:01:56.305 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
teach something,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:84%
the more you learn about
it, as you probably know.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So I was getting information all
along as I activated my Merkabah

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:90%
and would connect with source.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the information
would float in.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't be like it would
be a packet of information.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:10%
It would be more like I
would have an understanding.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:10%
Or I'd get words that
I didn't understand.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of it would
follow, almost like a puzzle.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.228 align:middle line:10%
I'd get one piece.

00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:10%
And then I'd get another piece.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.820 align:middle line:10%
And then suddenly,
it fit together.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:90%
So it happened.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge base built over a
period of years, even decades.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUREEN: Decades.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, same for me.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you get bits and pieces.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it
takes encountering

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:90%
another body of information.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And boom, everything
starts clicking together.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.188 align:middle line:84%
So that's where you are
now, where it's clicked.

00:02:46.188 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUREEN: Right, it's clicked.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still learning,
like everybody else.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when
you started, did you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:84%
continue receiving information
from guides or higher mind?

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.115 align:middle line:84%
Or was it more that you
were exposed to Merkabah

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:90%
and practiced?

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: I practiced
the Merkabah.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that that
connection opens me up.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm actively pursuing
knowledge at that level.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes when
I write, sometimes

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:10%
when I'm working with students,
the information will flow.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:10%
And as an Akashic Records
guide, a lot of information

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:10%
came through, either for
me or for the clients.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The way
you take information,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
would you be seeing,
hearing, or simply knowing?

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Which clair were you?

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUREEN: More about knowing.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally, I
would hear things.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, it was a knowing
that would just come through.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.814 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:36.814 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to get
a classic definition.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you go
to the dictionary,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:84%
this is a classic
definition of dimensions.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Because until now, it's really
been considered a matter

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:90%
of science and mathematics.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So a dimension is a conceptual
direction, such as width,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:90%
height, or depth.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension
was conceived

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:84%
to mathematically unify
gravity and electromagnetism

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:90%
into a single force.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
No wonder we have no idea
what this really means to us.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUREEN: Yes.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And I agree that it's a
very confusing subject.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
What has come about, I
believe, is a divergence

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.100 align:middle line:90%
of two definitions.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.215 align:middle line:10%
And so when you do
a search for what

00:04:22.215 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:10%
does it mean, what does
fifth dimension mean,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:10%
you'll actually
get a metaphysical

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:10%
or a spiritual version as well
as a mathematical version that

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:10%
was based on string theory.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:84%
But string theory
is still a theory.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's still a theory.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And also, the spirit realm
intersects with that knowledge.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all true
together at the same time.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But we as an experiencer,
that's a whole different thing.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
to experience these?

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:84%
We're in the third
dimension right now.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:10%
I mean, technically
speaking, if we're

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:10%
talking about physically jumping
into the fifth dimension,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't even be
able to see you.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.155 align:middle line:10%
You would be at a totally
different density.

00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: Maybe
I'd go with you.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or maybe
you'd go with me.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But we're looking at really as
fifth dimensional consciousness,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: Well, this is
a very interesting thing

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.062 align:middle line:90%
because I agree with you.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Right now, that's
our perception.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that it
is possible and likely

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're all going
to physically move

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
into the fifth dimension--
body and mind and heart.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're
going to get to that.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: So that
movement, people

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:84%
are feeling It's like
when you fall in love.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a different state.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.496 align:middle line:90%
You feel differently.

00:05:35.496 --> 00:05:36.296 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:36.296 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me
that's what it is.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you have
to experience it

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.580 align:middle line:84%
through your own feeling body,
not emotional body but feeling

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.380 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with the third
dimension, where we are right

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
now and what you consider to be
the hallmark and the signature

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:90%
feelings of the third dimension.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: So from
my vantage point,

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
the short version is
it's heaven on earth.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.100 align:middle line:84%
The longer version is it's
polarity consciousness.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:84%
It is linear thinking
and time, time being

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:90%
linear in that vantage point.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.530 align:middle line:10%
So those three categories
are third dimension.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.130 align:middle line:10%
And because of polarity,
it pulls us in.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:10%
And we often react or
interact in that way.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
this is a subject

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that's coming up a lot lately,
is the notion of polarity

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and that this is a
planet of polarity.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you think,
but wait a minute,

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
the Earth is actually
transitioning

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:90%
into a finer frequency herself.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And you really can't
be here unless we can

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.575 align:middle line:90%
incarnate into that frequency.

00:06:42.575 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: And I
concur with that.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
But my guidance is that
the Earth is ascending.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's waiting on us
to complete that cycle.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:10%
We are able to experience
that higher state when

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:10%
we feel our heart expand, when
we have these yummy interactions

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.930 align:middle line:10%
with people.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
we don't know

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:84%
we've been fifth dimensional
until we slide back into third.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:90%
And things are not so pretty.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So I share with
people when you're

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:84%
feeling in that beautiful,
blissful state, when

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.010 align:middle line:84%
you watch a sunset, when
you're with a baby, those kinds

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:10%
And anchor that in so that you
could replicate it and bring it

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:10%
into your life more and more
because I think it's up to us

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:10%
to figure out how we're going
to move our physical bodies,

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.293 align:middle line:10%
because we've been told
it's never been done before.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I've
heard the same things

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that it hasn't been done--
we're a unique species.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.510 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't been done before.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Normally, if you're in another
place, in a dimension--

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.220 align:middle line:84%
physical, non-physical,
semi-physical--

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:84%
it's fairly stable in terms
of the dimensionality.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Although the notion
that consciousness

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:84%
is shifting
throughout the cosmos

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:84%
right now, including here
through the Earth, up

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:84%
through us, that might
be a little exception,

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:84%
this period of time with this
wave of consciousness shifting

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But you just said,
this isn't normal.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.930 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't normally happen.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:90%
So talk about that for a bit.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: OK, so runner's
high is a great example.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:90%
I had a friend come to me.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm a runner.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't use headphones.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:90%
I just go into the zone.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and
I had this idea.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was an idea
for me, something

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:90%
I should do with my business.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was an excellent idea.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:90%
And he shared it with me.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And under the circumstances,
it was a very powerful message

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was also involving
him in his work.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:10%
So in that zone, we
are able to acquire

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:10%
awareness of our ideal
outcomes or our ideal actions.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's part of 5D.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So our
chemical structure

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:90%
is wrapped up with frequencies.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It takes us into different
frequency ranges then.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUREEN: I think so.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a scientist.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't read
a study about this.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that when people
do certain kinds of drugs

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:84%
or certain kind of
supplements, that they

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:84%
are elevated in
a way that allows

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.660 align:middle line:84%
them to access without
having earned it, we'll say.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:10%
They have the ability
to just make that leap.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.530 align:middle line:10%
And it's a way to validate it.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:10%
I've had people
in classes who've

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:10%
seen the field when they're
on some kind of a trip, a drug

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:10%
trip.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And then they come to me and
say, I've seen it already.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I know it's real.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So part of that would be
unhooking from the barriers that

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
have been put in place,
either by us or by the field,

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
so that we are
multidimensional all the time.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So from what
you understand then--

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
you just made mention
of this, barriers

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that have been put
into the field--

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUREEN: There
were certain beings

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that put programs that
limited people's abilities

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:90%
to acquire certain skills.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:84%
For example, I was
told by my guides

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:84%
that there was a self-healing
DNA gene that we could access.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.350 align:middle line:90%
But I had to find it.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:10%
And I found it in
the lower dimension.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.658 align:middle line:10%
And it made me laugh
when I discovered it.

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:10%
And I see you're smiling,
because who would

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:10%
look in a lower dimension?

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:10%
You'd expect, if you're
evolving and going higher--

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I want
to hear more about this.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Continue, please.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: So the
self-healing DNA,

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.770 align:middle line:84%
once you know that it's there
and it's in the lower dimension,

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
you simply intend to
activate it and turn it on.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And it literally makes it
easier for you to heal.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And it also keeps
you young because it

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
allows the body to recover
to its original state.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:90%
And that was turned off.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So were
you able to go there?

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Yeah.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And find it?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Absolutely And
naming it is all it's needed

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Now.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So what was the
nature of the lower

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:90%
dimension that you visited?

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Second dimension.
so it was just underneath

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:84%
our existence that
we currently vibe at.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was simply a matter of
accessing it and reactivating it

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and also rejuvenating it because
it had atrophied quite a bit.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did you have a chance
to spend any time in that second

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:90%
dimension?

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Because all dimensions have
their own beings and life forms.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.938 align:middle line:90%
What was it like in this point?

00:11:30.938 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Well, I
was there on a mission.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So once I got to my destination
and acquired what I needed,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:90%
I left.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
It's funny that you
asked that because I

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:84%
wasn't curious about what
else was there, to be fair.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because I've
often thought about that.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:10%
My understanding as Earth
being in the middle plane,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of what I identify
with or the language I would use

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:10%
is more hermetic in nature
because I studied hermetics

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:10%
for so many years, and they
always talk about Earth

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.790 align:middle line:10%
being in the middle
plane, with the dimensions

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.520 align:middle line:10%
above and the dimensions below.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:10%
But what I keep
thinking about is

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:10%
how we're influenced, depending
on your own frequency range,

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:10%
by either lower or
higher dimensions, which

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:10%
is an interesting
thing about Earth.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Yes, it's
very interesting.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:90%
And you're absolutely right.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
We can access higher planes
of existence with intention

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and, of course,
stilling the mind

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
because the mind is the
chatterbox that kind of keeps us

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.100 align:middle line:90%
from doing that.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so what I noticed
is that in the lower dimensions

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
were really interesting
type of beings there.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:10%
But I'm wondering if
because it's more focused

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:10%
in a sense on the physical
rather than the more

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:10%
spiritual elements,
if that might

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:10%
be where the DNA, unlocking
that DNA for healing

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:10%
existed because it is a
more raw, physical plane.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.407 align:middle line:10%
Is that possible?

00:12:56.407 --> 00:12:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: I think it is.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's probable as well.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.180 align:middle line:84%
If you were going to hide
something from someone

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and you knew they were going
to be trying to advance upward,

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't put it where
they would see it or find it.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right, to
knock it down a notch

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:84%
because we're always trying to
seek to get out of the body,

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:90%
to go higher and so forth.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about your journey,

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:84%
going and fetching
your own healing

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:90%
DNA in the lower dimension.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.405 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Well, I wasn't
fetching it just for me.

00:13:23.405 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I was fetching it, so I
could teach others to do it.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was a simple meditation,
but clear intention.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked where it was,
I asked probably every day

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.815 align:middle line:84%
for nine or 10 months
before I actually found it.

00:13:38.815 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: So I would go into
the alternate reality and access

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
my own energy field and then
look, where could it be.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:10%
And once I found it,
it was simply a matter

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.300 align:middle line:10%
of seeing it as a sole thing.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:10%
It was almost like a
spotlight was on it

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:10%
once I knew where it was.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And so then my
intention and my goal

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
was to help others
find it by giving them

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.160 align:middle line:84%
the description of where
it is and naming it.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I was told
later by my guides,

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:84%
all they have to do is name
that they want to acquire this.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually say it
every night at bedtime.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What's the name?

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: I'm calling in
my self-healing DNA strands

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
to activate, elevate me
to my highest potential.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when you were
looking around in the dark

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:84%
there, I guess, there's
spotlight trying to find it.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.892 align:middle line:90%
What was happening?

00:14:29.892 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
You were just coming
up with empty space,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
there was just nothing
showing itself to you?

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.777 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: That is correct.

00:14:34.777 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Nothing showed itself
to me because I wasn't

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:90%
open to receive just anything.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't on a journey to
check out the second dimension

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know that
that's where I was going to go,

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:45.860 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I was like on a search
in terms of where is it.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:10%
And it's a little
bit like when you've

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:10%
misplaced a piece of jewelry.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:10%
And you say to yourself, I
want to know where it is.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it shows
up in your mind's eye,

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and you can see
exactly where it is.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.693 align:middle line:84%
But you're not seeing
the whole house.

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing that one spot.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so were you
surprised when you found it

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.817 align:middle line:90%
in a lower dimensional field?

00:15:08.817 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: I was, but
then I thought, well,

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
this makes perfect
sense because--

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where
would you hide it?

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Where would
you hide it, exactly.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And see, the beings weren't
allowed to remove it.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So in order to affect
creation and the evolution

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
they altered the DNA

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:84%
without sealing it because they
wouldn't be allowed to steal it.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Who would--
the people that--

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: The beings--

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --locked it, that
blocked our access to it?

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: That moved the
access would not have been able

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.163 align:middle line:84%
to remove it because it was
part of our divine inheritance.

00:15:44.163 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I
mean, why stop there?

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.660 align:middle line:84%
They messed with so
many other things.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: You know what, I
think there's a few cosmic laws

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.702 align:middle line:90%
that they just can't break.

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, well,
that's good to know.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, so before we go any
further because we're

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
using these different
terms, how would you

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.950 align:middle line:84%
describe the difference
between vibration frequency

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and dimensionality because
these are all conflated?

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: True.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I see vibration as the element
where we are expressing at.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a way to define a layer.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And then frequency is the
oscillation of the vibration

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:90%
and how fast it oscillates.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And the dimensions are the
actual platforms or the layers

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.870 align:middle line:84%
that we have expressed our
understanding within it.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So could a dimension
also be described as a realm,

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.992 align:middle line:84%
like in the hermetic parlance,
they call them realms?

00:16:38.992 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Yes, I
would agree with that.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is
there's a part of me that

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
sees these dimensions and
then the scaffolding within it

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and the ways that
we can interact.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'll call them the half
steps between certain sections.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:04.319 align:middle line:10%
And then I see that the energy
is really a label that we

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.849 align:middle line:10%
give in order to understand it.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:09.690 align:middle line:84%
They say in many of
the sacred literature

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:84%
that when you name something,
you can own it or command it.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And so part of this idea,
whether it's hermetic or coming

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
from other mystical
teachings, is

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.270 align:middle line:84%
once we have a label
that is commonly used,

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:84%
we have the capacity
to work with it.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in
with all of this,

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:84%
if everything is in a
sense mind or creation,

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:84%
how does the mind play in all
of this and across dimensions,

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:84%
because then the mind gets
whipped up with emotions.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:84%
They have all kinds
of fun together.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with mind.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Well,
the mind isn't--

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe the mind is
actually housed in our brain.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.653 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, not at all.

00:17:52.653 --> 00:17:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Nobody watching this
does, by the way.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Oh, good.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.793 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, no.

00:17:55.793 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: So the mind is
the aspect we use to express

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:10%
consciousness or to
experience consciousness.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So we use the mind to define
what we're experiencing.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:10%
So then the emotions
overlay that.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.630 align:middle line:10%
And I see emotion
as energy in motion.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:10%
And so if you think
of a coloring book,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:10%
that's the mind experience.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's got drawings in it.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But then when you add emotion,
you're adding color to it.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:90%
So it gives it a richness.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:90%
It gives it a depth.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And it prolongs the
experience because emotion

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:39.570 align:middle line:84%
makes an experience last longer
because we ruminate about it,

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and we have an
intensity that we didn't

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:90%
have without that emotion.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Then where does the
subconscious factor into all

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
of this, this library of
everything that is us?

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: again,
I'm not a scientist.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm a mystic.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:10%
So my understanding is
that the subconscious

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:10%
is a hidden part of
mind and consciousness

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:10%
itself that we can
access if we know how.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:17.000 align:middle line:10%
And there's many
techniques that can be used

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:10%
to change our subconscious.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of the techniques
that I discovered

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:84%
was to allow yourself
to create a statement.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you were
abused as a child,

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
unhook from that.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it was
just verbal abuse.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you were younger,
I used to blah, blah, blah.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.905 align:middle line:84%
But today, I can say
you're a brilliant woman,

00:19:40.905 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:84%
you know how to take
care of yourself.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very proud of you.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So you create a statement
that the subconscious accepts.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you use
the great takeaway,

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:84%
which is the "but" word,
and then you reframe it.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:10%
And now you've seeded
the subconscious

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:10%
with a positive statement.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.720 align:middle line:10%
So that's something
that I teach.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I ask people to
write a whole page

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.535 align:middle line:84%
of these kinds of statements,
either things that you were

00:20:05.535 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
told, the good ones, as
well as the compromised ones

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:84%
because most times those hurtful
statements are well intentioned,

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:84%
even if the person saying them
was broken when they said it.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it
does create trauma.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the technique that you
just talked about a moment ago,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I would think that
you'd have to have

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.133 align:middle line:84%
a fair amount of repetition with
that to overwrite a program.

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: That
is exactly right.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I actually asked
people after they

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
write it to record
it on their phone

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and to play it back for 45
days, every day at least once.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, OK.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.308 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you can kind of
hack in through hypnosis.

00:20:50.308 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Have you played with
hypnosis at all?

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.490 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: Yeah, I
don't like hypnosis,

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.500 align:middle line:10%
unless it's self-hypnosis.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to be
the person controlling

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:90%
my inner consciousness.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, either way, I
mean, you can kind of

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.575 align:middle line:84%
get there and sometimes hack it
a little bit faster that way.

00:21:06.575 --> 00:21:07.375 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Right.

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So 45 days is what
you feel it takes to overwrite

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.960 align:middle line:10%
a traumatic or negative
influence coming from

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.760 align:middle line:10%
the subconscious.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Right.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And the way to do it is
always to say something

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that ties you to that idea, and
that doesn't have to be deep.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And then follow with the word
"but" and then a positive.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.138 align:middle line:84%
I can see you're
accomplished, blah, blah blah.

00:21:25.138 --> 00:21:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so proud of you,
which is very, very important.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.180 align:middle line:10%
And you always put it
in the first person.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:10%
So it's like a one-woman
play or a one-man play.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
The speaker keeps changing
on your list of statements

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.920 align:middle line:90%
that you make.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And 45 days, it
turns out, according

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to Donny Epstein, a
well-known chiropractor,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:84%
who's written a lot of
work you may know of him.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:84%
He says it takes 45
days to make new DNA.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So the DNA being produced
is being programmed

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:84%
with the new information,
which theoretically

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.310 align:middle line:84%
should create a different
outcome on a physical level.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Exactly, exactly.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of
that, I did something

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.870 align:middle line:84%
that was quite spontaneous,
and it turned out

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.090 align:middle line:90%
to be a very funny experiment.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I had a bathroom
that I didn't like.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:84%
It was in a lower
level of my home.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a little
funky and it was cold.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:84%
It had a heater that
nobody ever turned on.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.770 align:middle line:10%
It had a little tiny bit
of mold in the shower,

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:10%
so I had to flood.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:10%
That room was affected.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:10%
So we stripped everything
down, cleaned it all up,

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:10%
and I decided to write
positive statements on the wall

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:10%
before I put the wallpaper up.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And every time a guest
would use that bathroom,

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:84%
they would come back
and say these statements

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:84%
that I had put on the
wall underneath the wall--

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Underneath
the wallpaper.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:41.293 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Exactly.

00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh
that's interesting.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Yes.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- yeah, this
is pretty powerful.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So we have something
that's sabotaging us

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:84%
from our subconscious,
programming

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
from either past lives or
maybe earlier in this lifetime.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Right.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we make this
statement that you see this part

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:84%
of yourself, you
know it's suffering.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Right.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But then you put the
newer reflection of what you

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.537 align:middle line:84%
have become, what you've
built of your life since then.

00:23:09.537 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Exactly.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.130 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And you do this and
you record it on your phone.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: Right.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then you play it
back or you say it to yourself.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: No, you
play it back every day.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.017 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Play
it back every day.

00:23:19.017 --> 00:23:21.358 align:middle line:84%
And you play it just once or
do you play it repeatedly?

00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Well, I recommend
that you play it at least once.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.010 align:middle line:90%
That's really all you need.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Once a day.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: And I tell people,
do it when you're brushing

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:84%
your teeth or some
mundane chore,

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that you have your body is
busy, but your mind is free.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then is it
helpful for you to feel

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.060 align:middle line:90%
the truth of that statement?

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:43.575 align:middle line:84%
Where do feelings start coming
into it to boost this shift?

00:23:43.575 --> 00:23:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: This is one of those
things that's fake it till you

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:90%
make it.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.503 align:middle line:84%
So you don't necessarily
need to feel it

00:23:49.503 --> 00:23:51.795 align:middle line:84%
at first because a lot of
people would have resistance.

00:23:51.795 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.272 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: And they wouldn't
buy the new statement.

00:23:55.272 --> 00:23:56.072 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:56.072 --> 00:23:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: But after
repeating it for 45 days,

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:90%
it's become their new MO.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if you have this,
I am now a capable, a mature,

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:84%
successful woman
in my own right,

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and your DNA is being created
at the same pace these messages

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.225 align:middle line:90%
taking hold, then what happens?

00:24:18.225 --> 00:24:19.025 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Right.

00:24:19.025 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But understand that
you're always speaking

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:90%
as if you're the speaker.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So you wouldn't say I'm
a successful person.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
You would say, I can see
you are a successful person,

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:31.870 align:middle line:90%
and I'm proud of you.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.190 align:middle line:90%
And it changes.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:84%
The speaker is still there, but
they have changed their tune.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And what's really interesting
is I've had students report back

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to me that when they reframed
what their parents had said

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.580 align:middle line:90%
to them, the parents changed.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So they changed the reality
both forward and backwards.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Give us a couple
stories of what's happened

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
to people, a couple that
off the top of your head,

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.840 align:middle line:84%
a couple of your students or
even yourself using this method

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:84%
in terms of changes in
their life, even externally.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Well, I'm sure that
part of it is people evolve.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it may be that the parent
had become a little more mellow.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we tend to
do that as we age,

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.470 align:middle line:84%
but the woman
reported back to me

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:84%
that her father was very
critical and very judgmental.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.270 align:middle line:10%
And as an adult, the
language she used

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:10%
was so similar to what he said
to her in the current time,

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.230 align:middle line:10%
that she could tie those
two events together.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't just that he
had changed and evolved,

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:10%
but that he was using the exact
same words that she had seeded

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.950 align:middle line:10%
into her own subconscious,
which apparently

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:10%
seeded his subconscious.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And think about it, when we
talk to someone, let's say you

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and I are talking, but we
mentioned someone else's name.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of thinking
about that person.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.962 align:middle line:84%
And our thoughts move
in that direction.

00:25:53.962 --> 00:25:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And the person's in the room.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
They'll come over and
say, how are you doing?

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.448 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:25:58.448 --> 00:26:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're
creating an entanglement.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Exactly, exactly.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So OK.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.290 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:05.165 align:middle line:90%
That's a good method.

00:26:05.165 --> 00:26:07.160 align:middle line:84%
It gives a nice
takeaway for people.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:10%
So let's go into the
notion of fifth dimension

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:10%
and means of communication.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:10%
Because you say this, if you
can sustain these feelings

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:10%
of fifth dimensional
reality, like this euphoria,

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:26.330 align:middle line:10%
this runner's high, when you
can get so you can sustain it

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:10%
in your daily life
more, it brings

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.127 align:middle line:10%
about a different
kind of communication,

00:26:30.127 --> 00:26:31.668 align:middle line:10%
a different quality
of communication.

00:26:31.668 --> 00:26:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: And a different
interaction with people.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things I discovered

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.120 align:middle line:84%
is there are certain words
that we use every day that we

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.140 align:middle line:90%
could choose to not use.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:10%
We have jargon that
becomes popular

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:10%
and those kinds of things.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:10%
And one of the biggest areas
that I found was problematic was

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:10%
the phrase, "I have to."

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Because when I
say I have to show up for this

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.870 align:middle line:84%
meeting, I've handed
off my power to who.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:02.953 align:middle line:90%
I have to pick up my kids.

00:27:02.953 --> 00:27:05.287 align:middle line:84%
Well, why don't I just say,
I'm going to pick up my kids

00:27:05.287 --> 00:27:06.470 align:middle line:90%
and need to leave now.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Or I promised my boss,
I'd do this report.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:10%
I need to stop what I'm
doing to finish that.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:10%
When we say I have
to do this report,

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.280 align:middle line:10%
we're implying that
someone's making us,

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.205 align:middle line:10%
and it takes away
our sovereignty.

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very true.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.762 align:middle line:90%
So simple but true.

00:27:22.762 --> 00:27:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: And so
that's the number one.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
there's other common ones--

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't, I won't, I
shouldn't, and all of those

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:33.360 align:middle line:84%
are opportunities for
us to say, I wonder

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:90%
how I can do such and such.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how that's
going to work out.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I can remember getting a bill
when I was first getting started

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.990 align:middle line:84%
working in this area full-time,
and there wasn't a lot of money.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:10%
And a bill came in that I had
agreed to but forgotten about

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:10%
and didn't have
the money for it.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the bill and
I started to go into fear.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But then I caught
myself and said,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I wonder where the
money from this

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.700 align:middle line:84%
is going to-- where
the money is going

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.450 align:middle line:90%
to come from for this bill.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.913 align:middle line:84%
The universe must know something
I don't know and claimed that.

00:28:09.913 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you treated
it more with wonder.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Exactly, exactly.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.737 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how that's
going to work out.

00:28:15.737 --> 00:28:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's a
good way to do it.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, so a lot of times in
saying instead of us saying,

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I have to do this, I will
say, I need to do this.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.222 align:middle line:84%
So what is that
term doing to us?

00:28:26.222 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: A need
is an ownership.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm choosing.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:90%
I want it like that.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.090 align:middle line:90%
So it gives us a powerful place.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:35.332 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So need is a
better word than I have to.

00:28:35.332 --> 00:28:36.290 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: Absolutely.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:10%
Yeah because have to--

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.970 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: We're claiming
our responsibility.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:40.012 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: That's right.

00:28:40.012 --> 00:28:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And our sovereignty, our
ownership of it, exactly so.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you say that
if we can start watching

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:52.230 align:middle line:84%
our language and start speaking
in this more sovereign way,

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.408 align:middle line:84%
that it's almost
like a feedback loop.

00:28:56.408 --> 00:28:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: That's right.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes you don't
know that you consciously

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.640 align:middle line:90%
respond a certain way.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to pay
attention and choose your words

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:90%
a certain way, it elevates you.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And then when you slide into
5D, you get to stay there longer

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.330 align:middle line:84%
because you've acquired a skill
set that allows you to speak

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.180 align:middle line:90%
that way.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And in
speaking that way,

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.740 align:middle line:84%
it takes you more often
into that frequency range.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: That's right.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you speak about
it as a type of language that is

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:27.428 align:middle line:90%
not polarized.

00:29:27.428 --> 00:29:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: That's right.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Explain that.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.418 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Well, a polarized
language, first of all,

00:29:33.418 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:84%
we do know there's scientific
studies that say that the "not"

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:84%
word is not heard
by the subconscious.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So if I say, I'm not fat,
I'm really saying I'm fat.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.460 align:middle line:90%
And we don't want that.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:10%
So we choose to find
ways to express ourselves

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:10%
without certain
words or choosing

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:10%
words that are less polarized.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.440 align:middle line:10%
And it's often the verb.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.390 align:middle line:90%
So as we--

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I made a list in one
of the books of ways

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:06.630 align:middle line:84%
that we speak commonly and
then ways to work around it.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.660 align:middle line:10%
But essentially, I
need, I choose, I want,

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:10%
it makes me happy, I
like to, are all ways

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:10%
that we own and step into our
power with whatever it is we're

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.890 align:middle line:10%
choosing to do for ourselves.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's bring
emotions into it.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:90%
So now we're using thought.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.440 align:middle line:90%
We're using language.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.580 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to
be a little more

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
aware of the language
coming out of our mouth,

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.850 align:middle line:84%
getting rid of the
disempowering words.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.010 align:middle line:90%
No more "not" words.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:90%
No more "I have to" words.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But our emotions are still
there and on earth, they

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:41.720 align:middle line:90%
can be quite charged.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of chicken
and egg, which comes first.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.040 align:middle line:10%
But it seems to me, usually
a thought comes and then

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.618 align:middle line:10%
an emotion follows very
quickly on its heels.

00:30:50.618 --> 00:30:51.535 align:middle line:10%
It triggers something.

00:30:51.535 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: Right.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:10%
And oftentimes, it's triggered
by what someone else has

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.700 align:middle line:10%
said to you or what
someone else has said

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.650 align:middle line:10%
that got repeated back to you.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.700 align:middle line:10%
So we're reacting to
an outside influence.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So when these things
happen, there's

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:13.130 align:middle line:84%
lots of tools to be clearing
our unresolved emotions.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:84%
We often attract these
kinds of experiences,

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.830 align:middle line:90%
so we can clear that emotion.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And finally, it's a way to
look at what's being said

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and ask yourself, am
I validating something

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:84%
to sabotage myself or
is it simply not true.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And when it's simply not
true, you can dismiss it.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
powerful place to be,

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.120 align:middle line:84%
to be able to hear what someone
says and then dismiss it.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:10%
I remember something that
my mother said to me once,

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.220 align:middle line:10%
where I was wearing
a dress she thought

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:10%
made me look fat and said that.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, no.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: And,
I was in my 40s.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.840 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like I was a kid.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.430 align:middle line:90%
And I smiled at her.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:90%
I was in a good state.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.920 align:middle line:90%
I was in that 5D state.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And I smiled at her,
and I said, oh, mom, I'm

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.592 align:middle line:84%
pretty sure everybody
knows I'm overweight.

00:32:06.592 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I just want them to
know I have style.

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:09.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good for you.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.890 align:middle line:84%
But the way you described that
a minute ago, that kind of falls

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:17.130 align:middle line:84%
a little bit under the method
that Byron Katie taught

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:21.220 align:middle line:84%
years ago about really
questioning, is this true?

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:10%
And there's that little
sequence of five questions.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.410 align:middle line:10%
And it's actually what you say
is really quite effective, when

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.950 align:middle line:10%
you just stop yourself
and say, hold on a minute,

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:10%
is this actually true?

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And you stop yourself
in that moment

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and say, no, that was
never true or that

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:84%
was what someone else said about
me and I bought it ages ago.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So really starting to
look at your thoughts,

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.950 align:middle line:84%
examine them a
little more closely.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Right.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And each of us is
influenced differently.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people are more influenced
by what other people say.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And some people
are more influenced

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.880 align:middle line:90%
by what they heard as a child.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.550 align:middle line:10%
Once we recognize that what
other people say is not you,

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.510 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't matter.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:03.870 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, it's very powerful.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:04.670 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:09.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we covered what the
nature of the third dimension.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.410 align:middle line:84%
We've covered the feelings
of the fifth dimension.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.510 align:middle line:84%
But you say the portal
to the fifth dimension

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.920 align:middle line:90%
is the fourth dimension.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So what is the nature
of the fourth dimension?

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Again, a lot of
this came through my work

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:27.320 align:middle line:84%
in the Merkabah because
as a high schooler,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I aced all the math classes,
and I could have slept through

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:84%
geometry and still
pulled a good grade.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So I was-- I feel like this
was mother's milk for me.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
see the connection

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:84%
between the mathematics
and the dimensions.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So I saw fourth
dimension as the portal.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:54.500 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at the
direction of the ratio of phi,

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.460 align:middle line:10%
for example, and how that shifts
and evolves, it's never solid.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:90%
It always evolves.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And then as a musician,
I recognize that,

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and most musicians
will recognize this.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:84%
If you're playing
something in a major chord

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and then you want to create
some dissonance or some change,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.480 align:middle line:90%
you play a fourth or a seventh.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And that wants to
resolve up to the fifth

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and then occasionally
go to the octave,

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly what we're
doing with the dimensions.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, explain
that in a feeling set,

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.112 align:middle line:84%
so we know what
you're talking about.

00:34:28.112 --> 00:34:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: Yes, I usually
sing it, to be honest.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not--

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
would we feel like?

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.100 align:middle line:84%
We know what this euphoria,
like the runner's euphoria

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.639 align:middle line:90%
you talk about of the fifth.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Right.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we know what
it's like to live in the third.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.380 align:middle line:84%
We're living here all the
time, reacting to life.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.520 align:middle line:90%
The emotions get whipped around.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.570 align:middle line:90%
What's the fourth like?

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:45.920 align:middle line:84%
How do we know
we're in the fourth?

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.878 align:middle line:90%
What does it feel like?

00:34:46.878 --> 00:34:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: The fourth is
remarkably similar to third,

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.190 align:middle line:84%
except the emotions
are much higher.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:10%
So it's in that state
when you're frantic

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:58.810 align:middle line:10%
or when you're super
passionate about something

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:00.820 align:middle line:10%
or you find your voice
is getting louder

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:10%
and you're trying to convey
your message, whatever it is.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.050 align:middle line:10%
That's fourth dimension because
there's a greater intensity.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So fourth dimension moves
vibrationally faster than third.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And because of the speed, it can
slide up to fifth very quickly.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.980 align:middle line:84%
It can also devolve
back down into third,

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.150 align:middle line:84%
which can sometimes happen
because there is a lower fourth.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Fourth still has polarity.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:28.360 align:middle line:90%
And so fifth does not.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in that high
state on the upper fourth,

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.500 align:middle line:90%
you slide into fifth.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.770 align:middle line:84%
When you're on the lower part
of fourth, you slide down.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:37.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
like that scene,

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it was called
From What Dreams May Come,

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:84%
where the woman was
caught in purgatory.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: And her
husband came and said,

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.100 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to be here.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order to be able
to start resonating more

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.560 align:middle line:84%
permanently in the fifth,
more frequently in the fifth,

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.670 align:middle line:84%
you say that-- and
I agree with this.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It requires an actual faith
in life with a capital L,

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:13.450 align:middle line:84%
to understand that life and
all the systems supporting us,

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:17.310 align:middle line:84%
unseen systems, to
actually has our back.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Yes.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but
they are relying on us

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:27.500 align:middle line:84%
to express a certain
amount of balance and joy

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:32.540 align:middle line:84%
because all of the systems
are adversely affected

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:90%
when we do not do this.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:39.270 align:middle line:10%
And we have seen
it in experiences.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:45.020 align:middle line:10%
For example, one time when
I came home to my house

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:10%
and my backyard had
a cultivated garden,

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.920 align:middle line:10%
but it was all
full of quackgrass,

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.570 align:middle line:10%
it looked pretty bad.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:56.173 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
I thought the elementals

00:36:56.173 --> 00:36:57.090 align:middle line:90%
were going to help me.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.798 align:middle line:84%
I thought you guys
were going to help me.

00:36:58.798 --> 00:37:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of
ruminating in my head,

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.470 align:middle line:84%
like you would talk to a
teenager in their messy bedroom.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And then without
thinking, I said,

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.210 align:middle line:90%
I really wish I could hear you.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And boom, it turned
on just like that.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And this gnome stepped up
and he shook his finger at me

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.200 align:middle line:90%
and he said, you never asked us.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.597 align:middle line:90%
And I went, yes, I did.

00:37:18.597 --> 00:37:20.680 align:middle line:10%
Don't you remember when I
put in all those tulips,

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:10%
and we put in over
120 tulip bulbs,

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:10%
and with each one I blessed it.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.570 align:middle line:10%
I put the dolomite in.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:29.710 align:middle line:10%
And I asked you to-- he said, oh
no, you expected us to help you.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, my
god, this is gold.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if I have one
great adversary in life,

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:36.666 align:middle line:90%
it's crabgrass.

00:37:36.666 --> 00:37:37.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.930 align:middle line:90%
It's taken over.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to plant so many
different things in its place,

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:90%
and it always wins in the end.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But I've never
asked them for help.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I've never asked the
elementals to please help me.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Yeah.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:50.908 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I didn't
expect them to.

00:37:50.908 --> 00:37:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even-- I wasn't
even factoring them in.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: So at this point,
I'm consciously aware that

00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:00.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not making this up because I
would never say that to myself.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:05.872 align:middle line:84%
So I swallowed hard and ate
some humble pie and said--

00:38:05.872 --> 00:38:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Please, sir,
would you please help me with

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.170 align:middle line:90%
my crabgrass?

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: And they
said, if we do that,

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:15.330 align:middle line:84%
will you still come
out here all the time?

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, would I spend
time out in the garden

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.710 align:middle line:90%
admiring what they had done.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because they
were insinuating that if you

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.425 align:middle line:84%
didn't have problems and you
weren't trying to solve this

00:38:24.425 --> 00:38:25.960 align:middle line:84%
problem, which
draws you out here,

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.293 align:middle line:84%
if everything was going
smoothly, you might not show up.

00:38:28.293 --> 00:38:29.150 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: Exactly.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.672 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:38:30.672 --> 00:38:32.880 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: You might not
spend as much time admiring

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.080 align:middle line:10%
their work.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.283 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:38:35.283 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: So
they need feedback.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.810 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Everybody
needs acknowledgment.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:38.852 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: That's right.

00:38:38.852 --> 00:38:40.020 align:middle line:10%
Everybody needs feedback.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.610 align:middle line:10%
So at that time, I had
not bought lawn furniture

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:45.778 align:middle line:10%
for my back patio.

00:38:45.778 --> 00:38:47.070 align:middle line:90%
So I bought a table and chairs.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.852 align:middle line:84%
And I took every meal
outside from that point on.

00:38:49.852 --> 00:38:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, this is great.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.672 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: From March through
November until the snow flew.

00:38:54.672 --> 00:38:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, my gosh.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.040 align:middle line:90%
And I should know better.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.265 align:middle line:84%
I need to start
talking to my garden.

00:38:59.265 --> 00:39:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I have little
gnomes in my house.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.810 align:middle line:90%
I need to start talking to them.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: They loved candy.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
buy the good kind,

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.607 align:middle line:84%
and it has to be
individually wrapped.

00:39:05.607 --> 00:39:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Individually wrapped.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And where do you normally
leave it for them?

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: I usually tuck it
in a place that it's not visible

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
to other animals, so maybe
slightly under a rock

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.670 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And one time I put
chocolate out for them,

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and there was a random
ball in the backyard.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.460 align:middle line:90%
And there's no wind.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And the ball moved, and it
was hiding the chocolate.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I knew
they knew where it was.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.650 align:middle line:90%
I cannot believe it.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:35.940 align:middle line:90%
The time has absolutely flown.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.130 align:middle line:90%
We're already out of time.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.590 align:middle line:90%
So I have one more question.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: OK.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You see what's
going on in the world.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:90%
You see the density of emotions.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And you see that
we're getting more

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.560 align:middle line:84%
entrained to very
dense emotions, which

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.890 align:middle line:90%
are low frequency.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.340 align:middle line:84%
What would be your
one suggestion

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.970 align:middle line:84%
to people watching
this right now,

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to pull themselves out of
this dense emotional field

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and start moving up toward
this more sublime place?

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.770 align:middle line:10%
>> MAUREEN: To pretend you're
a grandmother and think about

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:10%
your grandkids.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:10%
And they can do no wrong.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.630 align:middle line:10%
When they're at your
house, whatever they do,

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.880 align:middle line:10%
for the most part,
it's totally fine.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.630 align:middle line:10%
So you look at what's going
on that you disapprove of

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.130 align:middle line:10%
and you think, yeah,
that's not cool.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.880 align:middle line:10%
And then you move yourself up
to another layer where you say,

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.285 align:middle line:10%
it's all going to work out.

00:40:21.285 --> 00:40:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because you've
seen it all before.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Exactly, exactly.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And a phrase that I use under
a very particular situation,

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:33.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's useful in
a universal way,

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.180 align:middle line:84%
is to say to yourself, there
were some scary moments,

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.240 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't that hard.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Yeah.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And in that time
frame, I was scared.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I was terrified
that I would fail.

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And little by little, I moved
into, it wasn't that hard.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So be our
own wise grandmother,

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.120 align:middle line:90%
looking at everything like kids.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.410 align:middle line:84%
We all have to go through
these developmental arcs.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.170 align:middle line:10%
And it will resolve,
especially if we

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:07.520 align:middle line:10%
can find our way to some
joy, a genuine joy that's

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.520 align:middle line:10%
often overlooked.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.530 align:middle line:10%
We try so hard to be so good
and so perfect, we forget joy.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MAUREEN: And I think that
our judgment holds us back.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that it's important
to feel the judgment

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and then unhook,
purposefully unhook and say,

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.260 align:middle line:90%
like you do kids.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, very good.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Any final thought
before we say goodbye?

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MAUREEN: Yes.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Ask for a day of
heaven on earth for me

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and you and everyone
we come in contact with

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:37.715 align:middle line:84%
and everyone we're in contact
with and watch the magic.

00:41:37.715 --> 00:41:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Excellent.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:39.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And I will get some
properly wrapped chocolates

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and find a place where all of
the mice and squirrels and such

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:46.730 align:middle line:90%
can't get to it.
