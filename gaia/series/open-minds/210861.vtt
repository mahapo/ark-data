[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: You know,
I've known the Z's for quite

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.830 align:middle line:90%
a few years.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And there were periods of time
where some of the stuff, they

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.030 align:middle line:90%
did not really want to get into.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>> LEE HARRIS: More people are
waking up to what's going on.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why
the Zs are being

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:84%
more transparent about some
of the control and corruption

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.370 align:middle line:84%
agendas that we actually
are trapped within.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Where we're at right now,
I'm like, oh, this is

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.780 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of that opening.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the very beginning of
that opening where the world

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.233 align:middle line:90%
does become very different.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is there anything
that pops out at you that you

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:84%
would have been hesitant to
share that you've been told?

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Exit points are
periods of time in your life

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
where you and your soul have
the opportunity to take you off

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.470 align:middle line:84%
You as a race simply
are not allowed

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.050 align:middle line:84%
to be controlled on
levels of consciousness.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So we want you to remember
your power as a people.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.827 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.827 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A few months
back, you may recall I did

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:84%
an interview with Lee Harris
and the Z's on the topic

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:84%
of what's coming up for
humanity over the next 100 years

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:90%
and much more.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Today, Lee and the
Z's and I are going

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:84%
to talk about equally
intriguing subjects,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:84%
such as our potential exit
points from this Earth life.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that there can be
as many as 100 opportunities

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:84%
for a soul to leave the
Earth life within a lifetime?

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.930 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:90%
This is just one of the things.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Lee.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Hi.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.277 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When I was reading
that in your new book,

00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I always thought
there were a few key points

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:90%
with astrology and all that.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.160 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to get into this
because it's much more complex.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yeah.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.835 align:middle line:10%
That was one of the
things that really hit me

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:10%
when they first explained
that concept to me years ago.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:10%
And so it's come through
the work at various points,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.085 align:middle line:10%
but it really made a big
moment in the latest book.

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:90%
But before we do that.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:90%
First of all, last--

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:90%
I thought we were smoking.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.138 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so
much good information

00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that came out in our last
interview, which is why we're

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:90%
doing a quick encore to that.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I
think I even said on set

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and I reiterate reading
your newest book

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
is that I've known the
Z's for quite a few years.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are periods of time
where some of the stuff, they

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.250 align:middle line:84%
did not really want to
get into in years past.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So tell me your
perception of what's

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.610 align:middle line:84%
happened because they're
very much more revealing now

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
about what humanity is
up against than they

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.253 align:middle line:84%
were even three, four,
five, six, seven years ago.

00:02:38.253 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:10%
I used to experience it that
their main focus and intent was

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:10%
to open us and that that really
was the drive, which it still

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:10%
is.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think a couple of
different things happened.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I had a personal experience
in 2019 in Costa Rica,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:84%
where I literally had an
awakening at a retreat center

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.740 align:middle line:90%
where I was running a retreat.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And after that moment,
I literally heard,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:90%
now everything is serious.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about your experience that

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
happened that allowed
this to happen.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: So we were running
a retreat in Costa Rica.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And we were on the
third or fourth day.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of our participants--
it was a morning off.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of our
participants actually

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:84%
passed while he
was on his own time

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.970 align:middle line:90%
on the beach with his wife.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that was
devastating for all of us

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and shocking and
seemed very surreal.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But those of us who
were called to the beach

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
to work on his body, there was
someone working on his heart

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.247 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get the
water out of his system.

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:84%
There were other people
holding space doing Reiki.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:90%
And I was there.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, what can I do?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:90%
And I spoke to him.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:90%
I spoke to his soul.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
It took me a minute
to figure that out.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And he was just floating above
his body, orange, so happy.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was pleading with him
to come back to his body.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:90%
And then, I tried getting angry.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And you get down here,
your wife is here.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And he had been so happy
four hours earlier.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:90%
He'd seen me at breakfast.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.722 align:middle line:90%
And he'd come over to me.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And we'd done a sound healing
session the night before.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I realized I want
to leave the corporate world

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and I want to go
into sound healing.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:90%
And he was in his early 60s.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine what
that did to the group.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was his wife who was
the reason we carried on

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:84%
because in the hours
afterwards, she said to me,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.278 align:middle line:90%
we're carrying on.

00:04:36.278 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't believe it
because I'm immediately

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.195 align:middle line:84%
thinking, well, we have
to send everyone home

00:04:40.195 --> 00:04:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and there's no way
we can continue.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:90%
But we did.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
what that does

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:84%
to a workshop of 88
people in Costa Rica.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It puts
the reality in it.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.897 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Really did.

00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And the night
before, the Z's had

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
been saying, live today, live
and love your life boldly, make

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:84%
sure you live in the moment
and be fully present.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:90%
And he died in the ocean.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
He had a heart
attack in the ocean.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And that was his happy place.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And his wife said,
he couldn't have

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
been in a more magical
environment, which

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:90%
she was incredible.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
She was a real warrior and a
real teacher for so many of us.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, about
three days after this,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:84%
while holding the
group together,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.998 align:middle line:84%
I had a very powerful
experience where

00:05:21.998 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was going to faint.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:90%
We were all in the restaurant.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I literally could feel
my body was going to faint.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm like uh-oh, I'm
going to fall over,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:90%
I have to leave the table.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.357 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine when you have
the whole place as your group,

00:05:36.357 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I did not want to fall
over in front of the group.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.462 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if I did, I did.

00:05:39.462 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't want to do that.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So I was very slowly
walking to the garden

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:84%
where there was this massive
Buddha that I had been

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:90%
communicating with all week.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd just go and stand by
him and I felt his energy.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I
literally had an experience

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:84%
where I knew I had to lie
down, look up at the sky,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and it was the
last big awakening

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:90%
experience of my life.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was suddenly just
feeling we're everything.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:84%
The rain that was
on the grass was me.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't me, I was
heart of the trees.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:90%
The Buddha was talking to me.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.473 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha was saying,
you can let go.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And whatever was leaving
my body, it was profound.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And for about 12 minutes, I
just felt completely connected

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.290 align:middle line:84%
to everything and completely
not identified with myself.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back,
literally I heard,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:90%
now your work gets serious.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
I didn't take--

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I've always taken
my work seriously,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:84%
even though I have
a sense of humor.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:90%
But I felt that.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:90%
And that was November 2019.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.488 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what happened
four months later was profound.

00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Things
got serious, COVID.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And so I'd often
thought I'd stop channeling

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:90%
publicly.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.592 align:middle line:84%
I've gone through
that several times.

00:06:51.592 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But I decided to kind
of commit to it again.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
coupled with what

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
we need right now in society
and that more people are

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.830 align:middle line:90%
waking up to what's going on.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why
the Z's are being

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
more transparent about some
of the control and corruption

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
agendas that we actually are
trapped within, regardless

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.430 align:middle line:90%
of your spiritual life.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.305 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're
getting into that today.

00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I found this
with my own group

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.820 align:middle line:84%
of beings and other channelers
who have groups of beings.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Most did not want to get
into that until something

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:90%
happened in recent times.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
starting to tiptoe in.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.240 align:middle line:90%
But the Z's are going for it.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:84%
They're actually going ahead
and explaining what's happened.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Not faces and
names, we don't need

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:84%
that in terms of
what's controlling us,

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:84%
but the nature of
what's going on.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
It's time that we
start understanding

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:84%
the seas we're swimming
in because it's all

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:90%
been kept from us.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And I have noticed as
a channeler publicly for almost

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
19 years, I'm always struck by
what I will hear them saying

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
to a group as information about
what the group is ready for.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:84%
When I used to do
one on ones, I could

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.760 align:middle line:84%
tell where the person was at
depending on how far they'd go.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that the
Z's keep coming out

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.850 align:middle line:84%
with this stuff and the fact
that they are weaving it

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:84%
through this book series
that Diana Edwards and I are

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:84%
creating tells me a lot
about the level of awareness

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.813 align:middle line:84%
that is rising on
the planet around it.

00:08:24.813 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That they can
speak publicly in this way.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So on that same topic,
before we go to the Z's, I

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.762 align:middle line:90%
wanted to ask you--

00:08:34.762 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
you hear things all
the time and you're

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:90%
giving information privately.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And we have a pretty
savvy audience

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.585 align:middle line:90%
that's watching right now.

00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
that pops out at you

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.220 align:middle line:84%
that you would have been
hesitant to share that you've

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
been told before these times
arrived that you feel is

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:90%
appropriate for the times now?

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: They alluded many
years ago to me that when I was

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:84%
in my 60s that one of my
roles would be around peace,

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and around peace not just
on Earth, but universally.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And so if I look at that on
a timeline now, I'm about--

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
we're about 14 years away
from that period of time.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So when they gave
me that information,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.493 align:middle line:90%
it was a decade ago.

00:09:22.493 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What did you
take that to mean literally?

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.702 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: It was slightly
science fiction to me,

00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:29.270 align:middle line:84%
in a way, because it
seemed so far away.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But what I was shown
or what I understood

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:84%
was that the Earth was
no longer just the Earth.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.560 align:middle line:84%
There was an
actualized experience

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of a
universe and that there

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:84%
are other beings and
other races and there

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:90%
are multiple things going on.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
will be one of many

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:90%
who are a peace ambassador.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, I didn't
assume that means I wear a robe

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and I give talks.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Because as we know, some
of the most important peace

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
ambassadors we have on
the planet are not public.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:84%
But I found it very
interesting that that

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:90%
was where we were heading.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And so as little
bits of information

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
would start to come
to me or be brought

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:84%
to me by certain
friends, people tell

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:90%
me things, which is helpful.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.920 align:middle line:84%
They'll go, oh,
I just heard this

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
from this person I
know who works here,

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:90%
and this is what I heard.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it kind of
started to give me

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
a sense that where we're
at right now, I'm like,

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is the beginning
of that opening.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
This is the very beginning of
that opening where the world

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.255 align:middle line:90%
does become very different.

00:10:29.255 --> 00:10:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, are you ready
to let the Z's come through?

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Totally.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Let me just have
a little of this.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Good a pleasure
to be back with you in this

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And we will say to you before we
go into the many curated areas

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:17.300 align:middle line:84%
you wish to take us that one
message for all, which relates

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:84%
to what you were just
speaking to Lee about,

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:25.790 align:middle line:84%
is that the main focus that
you must hold at this time,

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
regardless of how you feel about
what you see going on Earth

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:84%
or what distresses
you or what seems

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:84%
a little alarming or
unknown to you is love

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and power are the energies that
you have been, we will say,

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.650 align:middle line:90%
disconnected from.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And this passage of time
that you are going through--

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:84%
which is quite,
we would call it,

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.380 align:middle line:84%
trial and tribulation
in many ways--

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:84%
is designed to help you unlock
to your own love and power.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.290 align:middle line:84%
These are incredible
frequencies.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And your embodied power
is when your life force

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
can radiate and radiate
not just in a way that

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:84%
serves you, but also
serves those around you.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So we would like to put
that out there up front,

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that love and power is what
you are reconnecting with.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But it often requires wrestling
with the shadows on Earth,

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:84%
wrestling with the shadows
within your systems on Earth,

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, the shadows that
come up inside you for clearing

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:84%
from this specific time
you incarnated into

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
and the timelines
of Earth's history

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that you both interact with
the minute you are born

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and that many of you
have soul memories

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:90%
of from prior lifetimes.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's a perfect
entree into the first thing

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask you about,
which I assume you know.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with, you
have become very forthcoming

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
in the work that is
being released now

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.110 align:middle line:84%
through these newest
books, his book series,

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:84%
"Conversations with
the Z's" are much more

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
forthcoming about the stressors
and influences upon Earth,

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:90%
which you just alluded to.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think people are very
curious to know how that works,

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:84%
when it was put in place,
why it was put in place,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and what the purpose was for
having put these restrictions

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.620 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our
experiencing our full love

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and power, our full mind,
our full everything-- almost

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:84%
like a governor to
slow a car down.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.613 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us all
about that, please?

00:13:35.613 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yes and no.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:84%
We cannot tell you
all about that,

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:84%
for you would truly need to
devote an hour to it in order

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:47.780 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that the nuances
are discovered because even

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
with a group such
as yours, Regina,

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.990 align:middle line:84%
those who align with you and
what you say and what you do,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:90%
this is triggering information.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even mean
emotionally or psychologically.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So we understand
that many of you

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
will say, well, I already
know a lot of this.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.540 align:middle line:84%
But understand, this energy
that has been, we will say,

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:84%
woven into your planet to keep
you all contained and limited

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and underneath far
more of a gravity belt

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
than your actual soul
is designed to be,

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:84%
when it gets, shall we
say, rumbled or activated--

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
when it gets near to the
idea that more is possible

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:84%
or it starts to understand
the level of suppression,

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.120 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't help your system.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So it has to be done
in a very delicate way

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
because your systems are
what the future needs.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:45.020 align:middle line:84%
You each individually have
inside you, yes, the memory

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and the remembrance that
as a soul, you are vast

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and that when you return
to the soul realms,

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.780 align:middle line:90%
you reenact with that vastness.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But you all know very well
that in many cases, those

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:84%
who tune in to you--
and for example,

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:84%
you and Lee are
among this group.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Many of you have parachuted
to Earth at this time

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.210 align:middle line:90%
to raise the frequency.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, we will
use this word,

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:84%
but you are involved in
a historic galactic war.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is
playing out on Earth.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to
tell someone on Earth

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.400 align:middle line:84%
that, even someone who
has a knowledge of it,

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:84%
their first thought
can be to go into fear.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:90%
And the fear is historic.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:84%
We are not saying that the most
educated person cannot somewhat

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.510 align:middle line:84%
remove themselves from the
emotionalism that that word

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:90%
brings up.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But that is why we say there is
a limit to how much information

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:90%
we can give you in small doses.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:84%
We will at some point do a
deeper dive on all of this.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:84%
But at this point
in time, for us

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
to end our role on Earth
and our contract with Earth,

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
it is important for
us to keep, shall

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:84%
we say, empowering the soldiers,
rather than giving the soldiers

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:90%
an educational history.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:84%
There are others on
Earth who do that.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your
question in short,

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:10.530 align:middle line:84%
what you have to understand
is that Earth is not a place.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Many think of it
as a fixed planet.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Many think of the human
race as a fixed race.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:90%
You are all composites.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Earth itself is a
composite of other spheres

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.950 align:middle line:84%
of reality, the energy of other
planets in historic times.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was decided that Earth
could be what we would call

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
or what you might
understand as a safe place

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, which is the
other side of this equation.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Many of you look at what
you see going on Earth

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:90%
and you do not feel safe.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we'll tell you
that Earth is a safe place

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:47.820 align:middle line:90%
in the universe right now.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:84%
There have been many places
throughout the universe

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:84%
that you would not have
wanted to be nor would

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
life have been
allowed to sustain.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
But there is a, shall we say,
war going on inside the Earth

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
itself that has been going on
for tens of thousands of years.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And it is becoming,
shall we say, harder

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.089 align:middle line:84%
for that battle
to maintain itself

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
as the consciousness of
the planet is rising.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:90%
So that war is dying off.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.369 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean war as
an energy on the planet

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:84%
will die off completely
at this point.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:84%
It simply means
that it will change.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:84%
And so that is
why so many of you

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.950 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to see what
Lee would refer to as

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.350 align:middle line:90%
the corruption in your systems.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And you are a little more
equipped to be able to see it.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And there are good days and
bad days around this seeing.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.710 align:middle line:84%
There are days
where you are seeing

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.460 align:middle line:84%
that people or events or
systems are being exposed

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and the public are beginning
to see it and know it

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and certain measures are
taken to either quarantine

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
that area or those people
or remove that corruption.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But of course,
then the next day,

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:90%
you hear of or see another one.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:84%
That is because you are going
through an asteroid field

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.630 align:middle line:84%
where the war on Earth is
not only surfacing in a way

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
that it has never surfaced in
any of your multiple lifetimes,

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
those of you who have incarnated
here five or six times

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
recently, but more
importantly, it

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
is moving towards the
galactic center point.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So you are going to see as a
planet more Galactic awareness;

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:33.915 align:middle line:84%
contact; and, we will say,
merging in the decades to come.

00:18:33.915 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's
happening as a result of this

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.050 align:middle line:84%
is people are feeling
on an unconscious level

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.275 align:middle line:84%
the need to throw off
these shackles, regardless

00:18:45.275 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:84%
of who placed them there,
where they're from,

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:48.233 align:middle line:90%
and how long they've been.

00:18:48.233 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:84%
We feel this resistance where
we're starting to buck against,

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:84%
which is causing an extreme
rise in anger on the planet.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And so my question to
you is, oftentimes anger

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:90%
is a catalyst toward action.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Is there-- what would be
the proper relationship

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
to the anger stemming from
feelings of unfairness?

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:84%
What would be maybe the most
positive way in which we

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:90%
can use those feelings?

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, we will say
there are two ways of looking

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:90%
at this.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
There are those who do not,
we will say, as yet understand

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:90%
their feelings.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And there are those who do.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So the group who don't yet
understand their feelings, who

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:84%
believe that anger
is what they become,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:84%
they are so convinced that their
anger is now their personality,

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:90%
they don't tend to do so well.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:84%
They either lash
out, take revenge,

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:84%
behave in bombastic
or inflated ways,

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:84%
because they do not realize
anger is driving their car.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Whereas there are those who
are aware of their emotions

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and have some understanding
that the emotional system is

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
a field of movement that
moves through you and that

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
your relationship to
it and awareness of it

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:84%
is something that you must
be mindful of in order

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:90%
to be a whole integrated being.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So that group can use
anger as a wonderful signal

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:90%
that something needs to change.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Anger is often a boundary.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
You might get near somebody that
you do not feel aligned with.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And you start to feel
a little agitated,

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:90%
irritated, or frustrated.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you can
truly notice that,

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:84%
you will see that
that's your signal

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:90%
to move away from this person.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:90%
This is not your place.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not either that
you have to judge

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.400 align:middle line:90%
this person for who they are.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Don't get into all of
that old human stuff.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Just move away.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But in the case that
you are bringing up

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:84%
of people getting
angry, their anger

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:84%
is coming because they
are recognizing they are

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:90%
being suppressed and oppressed.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And anger is often
the moment where

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.710 align:middle line:84%
you break through
suppression and oppression.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, for many of
these beings, it's

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.160 align:middle line:84%
a wake-up call that their
system is not safe in the way

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:90%
that they thought it was.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:84%
We have to be careful here,
for there are elements

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
of your systems right now that
if they disappeared tomorrow,

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:90%
none of you would do very well.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So it is not to villainize
the system itself.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:84%
It is to recognize the
seeds of corruption that

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
build the system and to see if
this is the moment in history

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:84%
where Earth as a
humanity, it can

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:84%
rise against that in the
various ways it's happening.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always look like
revolution on the streets.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:84%
For many, there are
energy workers right now

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.940 align:middle line:84%
who are raising frequencies
in areas they go to and visit.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:90%
So anger is very important.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:90%
It is a signal.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.830 align:middle line:84%
It should be a temporary emotion
it is not something any of you

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:90%
should feel for very long.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you are,
however, someone who

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:84%
is coming to your anger
for the first time,

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.140 align:middle line:84%
it might rage through
you like a fire.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And it might take a while for
it to calm down because that

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:90%
is your life force.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So anger is a warning, it is
a protector, it is a boundary.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:84%
If you can start to see it that
way, it will serve you well.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And for the many
who, right now, are

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.110 align:middle line:84%
having a terrible
time in suffering

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and are feeling angry
about the system that

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
is trying to keep
them down, that anger

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:84%
is going to be fuel for
the people revolution.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, when we say
revolution, many of you

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.030 align:middle line:84%
think of past
revolutions have seen.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
This one will be
quite different.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And on the flip
side side of anger,

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:84%
many people are also feeling
the feelings of helplessness,

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:84%
like a true victimhood,
like this is bigger

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:90%
than we can even understand.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:90%
How can we ever move against it?

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
happens when someone sinks

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.047 align:middle line:90%
into despair and helplessness.

00:22:43.047 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, despair as a
brief experience is important

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:90%
for many of you.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.110 align:middle line:10%
It is often a place where
you eliminate sadness

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:52.820 align:middle line:10%
from not just your
own energy field,

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:10%
but sadness you have
picked up from others.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So despair and hopelessness
when you sink, what is happening

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:04.100 align:middle line:84%
is, you are, shall
we say, overtaken

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:84%
by the density of sadness,
hopelessness, and despair.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And what occurs for you
is you can no longer

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.770 align:middle line:90%
reach your higher vibrations.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:84%
You can no longer reach
the higher parts of you.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So the reason some are
in despair right now

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.040 align:middle line:84%
is because they are
in shock and grief

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:90%
as to what they are seeing.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The reason others
are in despair right

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:84%
now is because they are
buying the narrative

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:90%
they are being sold.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can't blame
them for that.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is looking for
information right now.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
how deeply are they

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:84%
looking at the information,
analyzing the information,

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:90%
and feeling the information?

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:44.980 align:middle line:84%
There are many who
are desperately

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:90%
trying to cling on to anything.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And so if the information serves
their emotional resonance,

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:84%
they will dive into it
hook, line, and sinker.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It is no different than getting
yourself into a relationship

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and declaring to
everybody that this

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:84%
is the truest love of your
life because you are having all

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:84%
of the happy romance
hormones and then

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.390 align:middle line:84%
two years later, you are
moving out with a black eye.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So you see, you have
to be very careful when

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:90%
emotion is allowed to lead.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And there are many on the planet
right now who are in despair

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.000 align:middle line:84%
because one of the mainstream
narratives that you have been

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:84%
witnessing over the recent
not just past few years,

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.810 align:middle line:84%
but indeed, it has been
building for decades,

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:30.110 align:middle line:84%
is that this is what's going
to happen on the planet.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.650 align:middle line:84%
This is how you are going
to suffer because of it.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is the solution we are
offering you to get through it.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And not many are
asking, is this true?

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Is this highly accurate?

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And is the solution
the best solution

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:90%
we have available to us?

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So the amnesia that many
have on Earth right now

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.880 align:middle line:84%
is they do not remember a time
where they were in oneness.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:84%
They remember a time where
they are in this government

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.390 align:middle line:90%
formation.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And they have got used
to being told what to do,

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:90%
what they're allowed.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:84%
It's no different to
the school system.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.920 align:middle line:90%
You have to behave.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:90%
You have to trust the teacher.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, most people are
beginning to question

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.850 align:middle line:90%
what is going on on the planet.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And your mainstream media
is, we will say, insidiously

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:90%
scaring you all to death.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:84%
It is doing it
insidiously because it's

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:84%
peppering in enough hope,
enough entertainment

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.330 align:middle line:84%
that you keep going
back to that mainstream

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
source of information while you
are also being indoctrinated

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:90%
to believe you are doomed.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:90%
And we do not see it that way.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for that.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you get
into alternate media,

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:84%
alternative media, then you have
to look at it from both sides.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.650 align:middle line:90%
It enslaves from both sides.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little
more polite language

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:47.560 align:middle line:90%
versus recognizable language.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.598 align:middle line:84%
Both seem to lead us to
the same place of despair.

00:25:50.598 --> 00:25:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, you also have
to remember that many who come

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:84%
here to fight the oppression--
and this is something you

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and Lee were speaking
on earlier personally.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Many who come here to
fight the oppression

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
were the oppressors
in a prior lifetime.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So for example, someone who
is very agitated by dictators

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and decides that they are here
to take down the dictator,

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
they quite likely were a
dictator in some way, shape,

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:90%
or form in their prior life.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
they ran a country.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.670 align:middle line:84%
But they may have been
dictatorial in the way

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.280 align:middle line:84%
that they did not treat
the humans around them.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So they come back
for karmic balance

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.960 align:middle line:84%
to help balance their own
journey and balance the planet.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.820 align:middle line:84%
It's why we say you have to be
a little careful about simply

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:84%
heaping judgment on each
other because if you go back

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:37.270 align:middle line:84%
in time far enough, you would
be a little horrified at some

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:84%
of the things that you have done
at other times, other places,

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and at different levels
of consciousness.

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you were
on the subject of media.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think, let's go ahead
and continue on that.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was reading a document
yesterday that was released.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big thing
about Twitter here on Earth

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:84%
right now that files
are being released

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.700 align:middle line:84%
about information that has been
kept or spun from humanity.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And the shocking thing about
this particular article

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.370 align:middle line:90%
had to do with the positioning--

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.040 align:middle line:84%
this happened to be around
the subject of health, COVID,

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.360 align:middle line:84%
vaccines-- but that the
companies that were positioning

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.720 align:middle line:90%
these influential--

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:84%
making influential positions
were children shows,

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:84%
exploratory shows
on documentaries,

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:90%
history, and so forth.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:84%
These mainstream outlets
that we think of as benign

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and we think of as
educational actually

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.430 align:middle line:84%
have been, to a good
extent, co-opted.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Can you expand on that?

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, most who are
listening to or watching this

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
are quite aware of the levels
of corruption that run through

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:84%
various areas of your
mainstream society.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, we will
go back to, this

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:84%
is the time when more on the
planet will start to see this.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
This will happen
for two reasons.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
We will say that the moves
that are being made are bolder.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So it is a little more
in people's faces.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:84%
But also, there are
many on the planet

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.510 align:middle line:84%
who are on the side of freedom
for the Earth who have even

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:84%
lost faith that any new
revelations could be genuine.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:84%
There is this perception
that it's all controlled.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So there is this idea that
many have where they say,

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.377 align:middle line:84%
well, this person
is being controlled,

00:28:26.377 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:84%
so they're allowed to give us a
certain amount of information.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.490 align:middle line:90%
We would say, don't be so sure.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying
that doesn't exist.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:84%
But what we are saying is there
is a wealth of information that

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:84%
is now coming out
that is coming out all

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.080 align:middle line:84%
over the world in different
ways at different times.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And the end goal of that
is to wake up enough people

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.830 align:middle line:84%
that enough people
start to question

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.650 align:middle line:84%
the narrative next
time they are pushed,

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and we will say
pushed, into fear.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can
get people into fear

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and then offer them
solutions out of their fear--

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.740 align:middle line:84%
because most people do not know
how to be with their emotions,

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.610 align:middle line:84%
nor have they really stopped to
consider what life, which is,

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.320 align:middle line:84%
from our perspective,
and this might

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.410 align:middle line:84%
be a little cold for
some, it's a holodeck.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So you see from our vantage
point and the vantage

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.590 align:middle line:84%
point of you as a soul, you
are in a holodeck simulation

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:84%
experience that will not last
for that long in linear time.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the joy of this
game is to cling to it

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:84%
so deeply, so
personally that when

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:84%
you are asked to
fear for your life,

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.520 align:middle line:84%
you will do anything
to stay on the holodeck

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:84%
if you aren't paying
attention to the options

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:90%
you are being given.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other side
of this is people

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:84%
will often say, well,
if it's a holodeck, how

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.150 align:middle line:84%
come awful things happen to
certain people on the planet?

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And we are saying, yes, there
are some terrible events

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.040 align:middle line:90%
that some go through.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But all of you go
through awful things.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.350 align:middle line:84%
There is not one person
on the planet who does not

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.790 align:middle line:84%
go through some
level of suffering

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.890 align:middle line:84%
on Earth because
suffering is one

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.630 align:middle line:90%
of the frequencies on Earth.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And it will not
change until there

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:84%
is a radical overhaul of the
consciousness of the planet.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's the journey
that you are all

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:90%
moving through right now.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:84%
The holodeck, the notion of
a holodeck, a lot of people

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.600 align:middle line:84%
find themselves feeling
disempowered at the notion

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.860 align:middle line:90%
that this is a holodeck.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But when we stop and consider
that we are non-material

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:84%
by nature, you can
see us, there's

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:32.120 align:middle line:84%
no there there, a few atoms
swirling about in space.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And then, it makes
sense to understand

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that these thought
forms we create,

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:84%
these frequencies
were bathed in do

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.182 align:middle line:90%
create essentially a holodeck.

00:30:39.182 --> 00:30:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's nothing
to be afraid of,

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.930 align:middle line:84%
it's just living in this
dimensional frequency.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yes.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:90%
And we will go one step further.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:84%
If you were what we would call
a very high-frequency planet

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and a very high-frequency
race and it was determined

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that for the balance
of you as a race

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and for the balance
of the planet,

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:84%
you all needed to ground a
bit more, rather than having

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:84%
cannelers or voices of
spirit that you connect

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:84%
with in yourself, you would
have people teaching you

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.120 align:middle line:84%
how to judge, how to hate,
how to bring the level down.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are not
saying that you have

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.420 align:middle line:84%
to judge your hate to
bring the level down,

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:90%
there are other ways to do it.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.700 align:middle line:84%
But our point to you is, you
are not a planet right now

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.470 align:middle line:90%
that needs to go backwards.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.890 align:middle line:84%
You are a planet that
needs to include the higher

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, which is why when
we say a holodeck, because

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:32.180 align:middle line:84%
from our perspective that is
how we see it-- and we can be,

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.750 align:middle line:84%
as you might say, that clinical
about it because we are not

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:84%
in a human body right now,
although that's arguable

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:84%
because we are halfway into
his body at this point.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But our point to
you is, it's not

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that you have to not see
humanity or Earth as real.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.500 align:middle line:84%
But it is that you mustn't
see it as the only real thing.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.530 align:middle line:84%
It's being able to
move your eyes around.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So today, I am seeing this
from a higher perspective.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow, I might be
in despair because I

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:90%
need to burn off some sadness.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.630 align:middle line:84%
But I'm never going to forget
that the other dimensions

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:84%
of existence and seeing
and being aren't within me.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so before we get
into the whole notion of how

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.910 align:middle line:84%
we're using crystalline
structures within the Earth

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and their auric fields, I would
like you to explain a bit more

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.290 align:middle line:84%
about the Earth's other
dimensions because we tend

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to think of Earth as just this
dimension we're experiencing

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:31.930 align:middle line:84%
rather than it as a being in
its full multidimensionality

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:32.730 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you could tell us what
say the next finer frequency

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.130 align:middle line:84%
dimensions would
look like or be like

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.600 align:middle line:84%
or how they would function
from your perspective,

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.040 align:middle line:84%
tell us about Earth from
a higher-dimensional look.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, to do that,
we first want to take you

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:84%
into the Earth, so into
the center of the Earth.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And we will describe
it this way.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:84%
The center of your Earth
is more of a mirror

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and more of a portal
than many would perceive

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.830 align:middle line:84%
it to be, meaning the very
center of your Earth, the core,

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:07.610 align:middle line:84%
has connections
galactically to so many

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.820 align:middle line:84%
other places,
planets, dimensions.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:15.860 align:middle line:84%
It is not solid the way
many may perceive it to be.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It is highly, highly active,
the center of your Earth.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:90%
It is very electrical.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, it is able
to connect across time, space,

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.340 align:middle line:90%
matter and move.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to give you
a very human example of it,

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.890 align:middle line:84%
we could say, well, the
center of your Earth

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.990 align:middle line:90%
is a teleportation station.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can teleport from
the very center of your Earth

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.160 align:middle line:84%
to other places, to other
universes, to other times.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.020 align:middle line:84%
That is the best
way we can describe

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.263 align:middle line:84%
to you what elementally
is taking place

00:33:50.263 --> 00:33:51.430 align:middle line:90%
in the center of your Earth.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you realize that
therefore, your gravity

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:58.480 align:middle line:84%
has to be very
pinned in, we often

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.830 align:middle line:90%
refer to this as programming.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.660 align:middle line:90%
You all have human programming.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Your society has been
programmed to some degree

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.270 align:middle line:84%
to hold you on the
surface of the Earth.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.300 align:middle line:84%
You often think that the
gravity is coming from above,

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.820 align:middle line:84%
that you had to drop
from above and you

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.290 align:middle line:90%
had to land into the Earth.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.139 align:middle line:84%
But you are actually being
pulled down by the Earth

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.880 align:middle line:84%
as well as activated by
the Earth at the same time.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.929 align:middle line:84%
Many of you are
aware that the energy

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:84%
of the inside of the
Earth is actually

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.740 align:middle line:84%
what is causing the shift in
consciousness on your planet

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.540 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.670 align:middle line:84%
It reverberates up
through the surface

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.050 align:middle line:90%
and moves through your bodies.

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:33.880 align:middle line:84%
But equally, you
are being pulled

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:90%
toward the center of the Earth.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So no wonder being human
feels so discombobulating

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:42.190 align:middle line:84%
because you are far more
in movement than any of you

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.290 align:middle line:84%
have ever been
allowed to understand.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is why so many
of you, when you reconnect

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to your spirit, your higher
self, your guide team,

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.230 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that puts
you into that place where

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:57.790 align:middle line:84%
you are expanded again, suddenly
it makes more sense to you.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And most of you can't
and won't maintain it.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, Lee shared his
personal awakening story

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.510 align:middle line:90%
in 2019, the latest one he had.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.880 align:middle line:84%
He can't stay there
because that's not his job.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.320 align:middle line:90%
He could have left.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.690 align:middle line:90%
That was one of his exit points.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:15.310 align:middle line:90%
But he chose to stay.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And he chose to come back.

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:90%
And he chose to double down.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And the gravity of the
Earth welcomed him back

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.090 align:middle line:84%
once his soul had made
the decision to stay.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So we have gone a little
off from the question

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that you originally asked,
but it felt important

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
for us to share that
piece in response

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.240 align:middle line:90%
to the words you gave us.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's OK.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And now, I could go
in 1,000 directions.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:42.220 align:middle line:84%
A glimpse of what
the dimension beyond,

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:84%
in the finer frequency range,
where we are right now,

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.070 align:middle line:84%
the dimension above,
a glimpse of what life

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.380 align:middle line:90%
is like there, how it expresses.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, the thing we
will say to you is twofold.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:84%
At this moment in time, you
are centering what some of you

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.510 align:middle line:84%
would call the fourth
dimension on Earth

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:84%
with options to go into
the fifth and the third.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.243 align:middle line:84%
So you can go a
little up and down.

00:36:03.243 --> 00:36:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we say
you are centering,

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.000 align:middle line:84%
we mean that is
mainstream consciousness.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So mainstream consciousness
is far more fourth dimensional

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.250 align:middle line:84%
than most of you yet understand
because the language is

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.720 align:middle line:90%
taking time to catch up.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:21.250 align:middle line:84%
People are having mystical,
unexplainable experiences

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:24.670 align:middle line:84%
that they have been trained to
not speak to each other about.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:28.250 align:middle line:84%
They have been trained through
use of taboo, manipulation,

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and in certain
periods of history,

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.633 align:middle line:84%
let's burn those witches so they
don't talk about these things.

00:36:32.633 --> 00:36:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
was just a great way

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.520 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of powerful women.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.450 align:middle line:84%
We will say that the
fourth-dimensional experiences

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:84%
that many are having
on Earth is what

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.900 align:middle line:90%
makes this time so different.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
many tend to think

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.120 align:middle line:84%
the reason they feel so strange
about the world is because

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.040 align:middle line:84%
of what they see
going on outside them.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.710 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize
what's going on inside

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:56.810 align:middle line:84%
them also does not match up
to where they were anymore.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So fourth dimension is
the norm at this point.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And we see by 2030,
there is the potential

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.680 align:middle line:84%
that the fifth could
begin to ground.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:84%
If things do not go
at the same speed,

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.900 align:middle line:84%
it would ground by
approximately 2040,

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.140 align:middle line:84%
but no later because it simply
won't be possible for it

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.710 align:middle line:90%
to take longer than that.

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So life at the
next level for many

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:84%
or for those who live
in the fifth dimension,

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.860 align:middle line:84%
we will say love and
harmony are very present.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.440 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
you don't occasionally

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:84%
run into areas where love
or harmony are not the norm,

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.200 align:middle line:84%
but you are not dragged
out of love and harmony

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.560 align:middle line:90%
because you encounter them.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
today who are living

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.260 align:middle line:84%
in the most compassionate state
that they are loving, for they

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:42.100 align:middle line:84%
are no longer knocked off
center by the bruises and wounds

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that humans like to throw
around in order to check,

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.280 align:middle line:90%
are we connected?

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's try connecting
through heartbreak.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good, now I feel connected.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.017 align:middle line:84%
What they don't
know is the kicker

00:37:51.017 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:84%
is going to come in six months
time when heartbreak is not

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:90%
a sustainable connection point.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.770 align:middle line:84%
So we can go on
if you wish us to.

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, no.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.848 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yes, I would love to.

00:38:01.848 --> 00:38:04.300 align:middle line:84%
If we had a three-hour show,
we'd go down every road.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But since we don't, thank you so
much for at least explaining up

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:11.020 align:middle line:84%
to the fifth, that we're
looking at our potential

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:84%
certainly by 2040 of moving
to a more homeostasis of love

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.260 align:middle line:90%
and harmony.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:17.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's beautiful.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: And we will clarify
that not every single member

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:24.070 align:middle line:84%
of the population has to be
in that position for it to be

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.960 align:middle line:90%
the dominant theme.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, wonderful.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
the exit points

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.830 align:middle line:84%
because is I found a
really interesting portion

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:34.810 align:middle line:90%
of your work with Lee.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And also you just mentioned
that Lee could have left

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:38.788 align:middle line:90%
during that experience in 2019.

00:38:38.788 --> 00:38:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yes, he
did not know that.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
learned in this particular book

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:48.100 align:middle line:84%
was that we may have as
many as 100 different exit

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.640 align:middle line:84%
points, when I had previously
believed we had a few.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe there's
only one and it's set.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So can you tell us how fluid
our life and our connection

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.840 align:middle line:90%
to our physical really is?

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yes.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So exit points is a
concept that we gave to Lee

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.000 align:middle line:90%
approximately a decade ago.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And we noticed when
we gave him that, it

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:90%
opened his frequency fast.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So it is something that we
have been speaking about more

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:15.940 align:middle line:84%
liberally because it tends to
wake you up and put you back

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:84%
in the present moment and
make you remember that life is

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.260 align:middle line:90%
a gift and it is not promised.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So exit points are periods
of time in your life--

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:30.850 align:middle line:84%
they may last for 10 minutes,
they may last for 10 days--

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:84%
where you and your soul
have the opportunity

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.600 align:middle line:90%
to take you off planet.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
there are some of you

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.800 align:middle line:84%
who have had
near-death experiences.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.220 align:middle line:84%
There are some of you who
have come back from those

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.480 align:middle line:90%
and have chosen to come back.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But you were very clear
it was an exit point.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is similar to what
Lee went through in Costa Rica.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.110 align:middle line:84%
The other side of
this is your soul

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and you get the opportunity
to decide if it is

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.750 align:middle line:90%
pertinent for you to carry on.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So if an exit point was
hanging around you for 10 days,

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.710 align:middle line:84%
you might not be feeling
great when this happens.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But equally, you could be
feeling higher than ever.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.870 align:middle line:84%
You could be feeling
happier than ever,

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.420 align:middle line:84%
like you've accomplished
more in your life

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.080 align:middle line:90%
than you ever possibly knew.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
there is a window of time

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:84%
where your soul, without your
human necessarily understanding

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.060 align:middle line:84%
what's going on, is
in negotiation to ask,

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.640 align:middle line:84%
is this the right
time for you to die?

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is the piece that many
people don't quite understand.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Your death is never
just about you, ever.

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Your death is perfectly
timed for the group

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.550 align:middle line:90%
that are left behind.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we know some of you
like to never see other humans

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and shut yourself
away in the house.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Even you, your death
and your energy field

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.490 align:middle line:84%
disappearing from that house
at the end of the street

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.160 align:middle line:84%
that you never leave is
going to vibrationally affect

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.890 align:middle line:84%
not only that whole
street, but your area.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:84%
You see, you all have
an incredible part

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.450 align:middle line:84%
to play in the
energy grid that you

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.520 align:middle line:90%
hold while you are incarnate.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if
you have loved ones,

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:84%
how they are affected by
your death and the timing

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:84%
of the death is
key because death

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.930 align:middle line:90%
creates a ripple of awakening.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:16.390 align:middle line:90%
It wakes up everyone near to it.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Even if grief is the
dominant experience

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.730 align:middle line:84%
that you are distracted
by, remember, grief

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.120 align:middle line:90%
is a transformational energy.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you get close
to a death window,

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.930 align:middle line:84%
you return to the place
of your birth, which

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:84%
is the moment where you
came back to the Earth

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and agreed to forget where
you had just come from.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.420 align:middle line:90%
So death energy is very potent.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And exit windows are things
that are actually pre-programmed

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:42.860 align:middle line:90%
for you throughout your life.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So some might decide their life
might go as long as 100 years.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And they are going
to plot 25 exit

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.160 align:middle line:90%
points through their journey.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And those exit
points will activate

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.990 align:middle line:84%
when they complete certain
themes or levels of their life.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you had to
come to Earth to forgive.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.950 align:middle line:84%
By the age of 42,
you've figured that out.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:04.580 align:middle line:90%
You now know how to forgive.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's wheel an exit
point in and see

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:84%
if you want to keep
playing the game

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:11.060 align:middle line:84%
or if this is the
time for you to go.

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So there are those
among you who know

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.460 align:middle line:84%
exactly what we are talking
about because you feel it

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:16.520 align:middle line:90%
when it's happening.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.503 align:middle line:84%
There are, and Lee has
been in this situation too,

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:21.670 align:middle line:84%
where you feel that things
are perhaps just a little

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.130 align:middle line:84%
too permeable in your
life and you aren't

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:90%
quite sure what's going on.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So we always say, if ever
you get that feeling,

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.250 align:middle line:90%
you don't need to go into fear.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:32.410 align:middle line:84%
But you may need to
have the awareness

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:36.190 align:middle line:84%
to say, ah, I just had a strange
vision of me having a car

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.100 align:middle line:90%
accident.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm driving
down the freeway.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I am going to intend,
I am going to be safe,

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:44.410 align:middle line:90%
I am going to drive well,

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to
have any accident.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And you may even want to pull
over or change the route.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So we always say, if you are
cognizant of your exit windows,

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.700 align:middle line:90%
you have a choice.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.515 align:middle line:84%
So allow yourself
to be involved.

00:42:57.515 --> 00:42:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:01.510 align:middle line:84%
That I think that's very
empowering for many people

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.470 align:middle line:90%
listening to this.

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:03.890 align:middle line:90%
And it certainly was for me.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And on a personal level,
I think I've already

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:90%
had quite a few exit points.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But if I may ask, I was tumbling
underneath the Truckee River

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.100 align:middle line:84%
when I was 26 years old,
it's all a blackout.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how I lived.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I ended up
popping up somewhere downriver

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.080 align:middle line:90%
with amnesia, basically.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me what
actually happened?

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I went underwater
and that was it.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.660 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was dead.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: We can
tell you two things.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And we will disclose
some personal things

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.970 align:middle line:84%
about you, which if you do not
want them left in the show,

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.030 align:middle line:84%
you can always
edit them out, ha.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:42.720 align:middle line:84%
You are a tricky one when
it comes to being on Earth

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.030 align:middle line:84%
because you are
crystalline in nature.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.910 align:middle line:84%
It is why you do the
job you do and it is why

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:49.230 align:middle line:90%
you have the mission you have.

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course, like
many who tune in to you,

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.910 align:middle line:84%
you don't always love
what's going on Earth,

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:58.470 align:middle line:84%
even though you have cultivated
a very strong and resilient way

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:02.370 align:middle line:84%
of approaching life
with not naive optimism,

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.860 align:middle line:84%
but a certain level of
optimism that you are here

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.180 align:middle line:84%
for a journey of
growth and change.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So you are, shall
we say, on the Earth

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:12.480 align:middle line:90%
in that level of consciousness.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But your body has
always been something

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:20.580 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't 100% sure was
actually attached to your soul.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So you have an experience where
you can speak to your body

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and you can ask your
body to do things.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:30.480 align:middle line:84%
But most other people are
actually a little more twinned

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:90%
with their body.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And there is more
of, or we should

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.090 align:middle line:84%
say, less of a gap
between the instruction

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.800 align:middle line:84%
to the body of what
the body needs to do.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Whereas you are almost
6 feet above your body

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.610 align:middle line:84%
telling it what to do and
telling it how to go places.

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And you do enjoy the
physical things about life.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And that is good.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But you've had to cultivate
a special relationship

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:51.790 align:middle line:90%
with your own body.

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So what we will tell
you about the exit point

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.120 align:middle line:84%
you describe in your
20s, that was your 17th.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And that was a ferocious
period for you.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Your life pre-40 has been
a lot more challenging

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:09.960 align:middle line:90%
than your life post 40.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is saying something,
for you, like all on Earth,

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.960 align:middle line:84%
are going through all kinds
of different challenges

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.350 align:middle line:84%
right now around the
identity you thought you had,

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:21.210 align:middle line:90%
where you find yourself.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:25.510 align:middle line:84%
That specific death
was actually a rebirth.

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:29.880 align:middle line:84%
So I was wondering for
water to rebirth your soul.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.950 align:middle line:84%
You were born with
a particular level

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:35.220 align:middle line:84%
of courage, which is required
for the job that you do.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:40.170 align:middle line:84%
You were born with a alignment
to truth and the courage

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:44.880 align:middle line:84%
to push through barriers and
people that might be stopping

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.970 align:middle line:90%
you from getting there.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And you had to learn to be
a little more considerate.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.720 align:middle line:84%
You had to learn to be a
little more mindful of people's

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.980 align:middle line:90%
feelings in your earlier life.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Not that you weren't
compassionate in your heart,

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.290 align:middle line:84%
but you didn't always
understand the ripple effect

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.640 align:middle line:84%
your courage and your
power could have on others.

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And as you grew,
you understood that.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But this was the beginning
of that understanding.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.720 align:middle line:84%
This late 20s moment
for you was you

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:14.580 align:middle line:84%
agreeing to come back and
live an even more human life

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:90%
after that point.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And that rebirth in cold water
was very important for you

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.400 align:middle line:84%
because it shocked
your electrical system,

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and it actually rewired you
into your body in a deeper way

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:84%
than you had ever been before,
which is, in some ways,

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.405 align:middle line:84%
strange because you were
a physical young person.

00:46:33.405 --> 00:46:36.270 align:middle line:84%
You were someone who had an
alignment with physicality.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:middle line:84%
You were not someone
who was afraid of being

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.190 align:middle line:90%
physical in the body.

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But when you were
in that alignment,

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:43.770 align:middle line:84%
it was how you felt
connected to your body.

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is often
the case of people

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.990 align:middle line:84%
who need to, we shall
say, be very sporty, very

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:84%
active, it is often the way
they are keeping themselves

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.550 align:middle line:84%
in a body that
they sometimes feel

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:54.990 align:middle line:90%
a little disconnected from.

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But that was your water rebirth
and that was a turning point

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:00.030 align:middle line:90%
for you in your future.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And you started to spiritually
align in a deeper way

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.460 align:middle line:90%
after that point.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You were following your path
in a more, shall we say,

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.340 align:middle line:90%
human way up to then.

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.420 align:middle line:90%
I would say that is true.

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much for that
elucidation on that experience.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And also, I hope some
people have found themselves

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:19.410 align:middle line:90%
in this as well.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Because again, you said that
was the 17th exit point.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.927 align:middle line:84%
I think I was always trying
to get out of the body.

00:47:24.927 --> 00:47:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Yes, but you only had
three that were dramatic like

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:28.650 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes
and several since.

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.400 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Final thoughts
that you would like

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:37.835 align:middle line:84%
us to know before we depart
from this conversation?

00:47:37.835 --> 00:47:39.210 align:middle line:84%
This has been very
powerful well.

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:41.127 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Well, a couple
of different things.

00:47:41.127 --> 00:47:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.630 align:middle line:90%
We are remembrance chamber.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And our job is to activate
remembrance in all of you.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:54.115 align:middle line:84%
And our job is completely
personal to you.

00:47:54.115 --> 00:47:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we have
a contract with Lee.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.032 align:middle line:90%
And Lee has a contract with us.

00:47:57.032 --> 00:47:58.600 align:middle line:90%
And there is that side of it.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But when we are emitting
what we are emitting,

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:04.890 align:middle line:84%
it is not important
that you agree with us,

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:06.270 align:middle line:90%
that you align with us.

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:07.692 align:middle line:90%
It is not important.

00:48:07.692 --> 00:48:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And there will be
certain things we

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.310 align:middle line:84%
say that you will not
align with, even if others,

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:12.570 align:middle line:90%
you really do.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Our job is not to tell
you what's happening.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to help you
remember what's happening.

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Because everything that's
playing out on Earth

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.670 align:middle line:90%
right now is scripted.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:26.910 align:middle line:84%
You are actually on an
ancient loop on Earth.

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:29.550 align:middle line:84%
The difference is, Earth
has never looked like this.

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And Earth's position
galactically,

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:38.070 align:middle line:84%
meaning how close it is to the
galactic boundary being broken

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:39.900 align:middle line:90%
is very unique.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, for
many of you who

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:45.330 align:middle line:84%
have gone through multiple
cycles of lifetimes on Earth,

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:47.880 align:middle line:84%
the reason many of you
feel nervous at a time

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.550 align:middle line:84%
like this is not because
of what you are being told

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.800 align:middle line:84%
or what you are fearing
is going to happen.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.030 align:middle line:84%
You are nervous because you
are going to spiritually die.

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think so many of you
are fixated on death right now?

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.612 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think it's
all over your world?

00:49:03.612 --> 00:49:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think people
are afraid of it?

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:09.280 align:middle line:84%
We say good, you're going to
die, what a beautiful release,

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.890 align:middle line:84%
you will be shocked how
wonderful actual death is

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:13.690 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Once you have left your body.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So we are never worried
about that for you.

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But your spiritual death
is a different matter.

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:24.150 align:middle line:84%
If consciousness
is rising and you

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:26.970 align:middle line:84%
are dying to the old
consciousness in yourself

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:28.690 align:middle line:84%
that you were, this
makes you nervous.

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Many of you have
done a lot of work

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:36.600 align:middle line:84%
on creating a grounded, wide
vessel in which your energy

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.710 align:middle line:90%
field can thrive on Earth.

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:41.430 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that it might be
taken from you or destabilize

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:43.320 align:middle line:90%
makes some of you nervous.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So we want you to just
consider this idea

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.230 align:middle line:84%
that you are facing, over
the next decade or two,

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:53.280 align:middle line:84%
a form of spiritual death of
what you thought Earth was

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.870 align:middle line:90%
and how you feel about it.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:58.032 align:middle line:84%
And hear us not through your
mind with that sentence.

00:49:58.032 --> 00:50:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Because if you hear us
through your mind, many of you

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.410 align:middle line:84%
will go, oh, yes,
well, I've known

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:03.993 align:middle line:84%
this is coming for 30, 40 years,
and I've been waiting for it.

00:50:03.993 --> 00:50:05.550 align:middle line:90%
No, no, you're not hearing us.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:06.900 align:middle line:90%
That's mental.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:10.060 align:middle line:84%
You're hearing information
and you're nodding your head.

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.750 align:middle line:84%
It's your energy
field that is going

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:14.490 align:middle line:90%
to have to go through this.

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is documenting
past and potential future

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.530 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Your energy field is going
to have to go through this.

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So from our perspective,
what you are all in right

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.500 align:middle line:84%
now is a spiritual
death and rebirth

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.770 align:middle line:84%
cycle that is very intense
for you, very potent.

00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But, and we have
said this all along,

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:37.140 align:middle line:84%
the gifts, the love,
the harmony, the power

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.990 align:middle line:84%
that you will access, the
connection that you will access

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:43.540 align:middle line:84%
is unlike anything you've
accessed on Earth before.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So you might say, so we have to
take the rough with a smooth.

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And we would say, you
have to release the rough

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.530 align:middle line:90%
as you go to the smooth.

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And many of you are made
up of events on Earth

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:58.050 align:middle line:90%
that are not high frequency.

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And so because you have ingested
those, and in many cases

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.930 align:middle line:84%
you have even formed your
personality around some

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:07.690 align:middle line:84%
of those things, you now have to
let them come out of your body.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it will
happen in two ways.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:12.960 align:middle line:84%
It will happen simply on
a cosmic, mystical level.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.862 align:middle line:84%
You will have your own
series of awakenings.

00:51:14.862 --> 00:51:16.320 align:middle line:84%
You will have your
own revelations.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.680 align:middle line:90%
You will have your own visions.

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, it will happen
on a mirror reality level.

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Something will
happen outside you

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.110 align:middle line:90%
that will trigger a response.

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Somebody dies is a
good example of this.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.420 align:middle line:84%
It triggers a response in
you because what's actually

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.370 align:middle line:84%
happening when that
person leaves the planet,

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.220 align:middle line:84%
you are having to
reorganize your inner self

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:38.610 align:middle line:84%
on a molecular, emotional,
and psychological level

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:43.650 align:middle line:84%
because you were tethered to
them in some mirroring way.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And now, they cannot play
that in the physical.

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:47.490 align:middle line:90%
So what does it do?

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:50.310 align:middle line:84%
It completely upends
and rearranges you.

00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:54.090 align:middle line:84%
This is why we call grief
the great transformer.

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:56.490 align:middle line:84%
So we understand that
grief, for many of you,

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:58.320 align:middle line:90%
is an undesirable state.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.970 align:middle line:84%
We would say it's
the way through.

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So there will be some grief
in the years and the decades

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:04.350 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And planetary grief
is going to be

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:06.970 align:middle line:90%
something you will deal with.

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.387 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
something that should

00:52:08.387 --> 00:52:10.920 align:middle line:84%
make you hide in your
house it's something

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that should make you recognize
rebirth is taking place.

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:18.650 align:middle line:90%
And we will close with this.

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It is very easy to listen to
even a conversation like this

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that is taking in high
frequency but is addressing

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:27.710 align:middle line:84%
low frequencies on the planet
and to not feel uplifted.

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you can.

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:30.493 align:middle line:90%
But other people will not.

00:52:30.493 --> 00:52:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Things may have been named
in this conversation that

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.310 align:middle line:90%
make them uncomfortable.

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:38.060 align:middle line:84%
We have said this to you before,
and we must reiterate it again,

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.680 align:middle line:84%
we know that many
of you are worried

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.450 align:middle line:90%
that you are under control.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.760 align:middle line:90%
You are not controllable.

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.077 align:middle line:90%
You are not controllable.

00:52:46.077 --> 00:52:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And you may argue that
because you will say, well,

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.950 align:middle line:84%
how come there are
pockets on Earth right now

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:84%
where we are seeing
control or there

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:54.640 align:middle line:84%
are whole countries who are far
more controlled than others?

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.280 align:middle line:90%
We understand it exists.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And we also
understand that there

00:52:58.230 --> 00:53:01.500 align:middle line:84%
are movements in place for it
to become more overarching.

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
brings you fear.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But you as a race
simply are not allowed

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to be controlled on
levels of consciousness.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So we want you to remember
your power as a people.

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.640 align:middle line:84%
We know it is hard in the
dark nights or moments.

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But it is your power as a
people and a group consciousness

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and a sharing,
caring community that

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:27.640 align:middle line:84%
is not only going to pull
you all through this period

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.550 align:middle line:84%
of time, but is
going to contribute

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:36.010 align:middle line:84%
toward the destabilization and
annihilation of certain groups

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:39.610 align:middle line:84%
who would rather see you
living in a more inhumane, more

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:40.960 align:middle line:90%
held down way.

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's a rocky road you
are in right now for sure.

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:49.030 align:middle line:84%
But we want to remind you, you
are not just here on a holodeck

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:52.030 align:middle line:84%
walking through some script
that's already decided for you

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.040 align:middle line:90%
and the ending isn't good.

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:58.300 align:middle line:84%
If you feel that and you
think that, we truly need you

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.150 align:middle line:84%
to wake up because
otherwise, you

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:04.090 align:middle line:84%
will agree to the
disempowering end

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that you are
forecasting for yourself

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and that certain others
would like to convince

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.300 align:middle line:90%
you is where things are going.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:14.780 align:middle line:84%
If nothing else, ask
yourself, why am I here?

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.610 align:middle line:90%
What am I here to do?

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:20.020 align:middle line:84%
How can I influence what's
going on this planet?

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:22.030 align:middle line:90%
And don't judge the answer.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:25.030 align:middle line:84%
If sitting at home by yourself
meditating for the next 10

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:26.740 align:middle line:90%
years is how you do it, great.

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.170 align:middle line:84%
If writing some book is
how you do it, great.

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:31.180 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter the form.

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:35.350 align:middle line:90%
The intention is everything.

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely beautiful.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:39.020 align:middle line:90%
In summary, we have each other.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.948 align:middle line:84%
And we're also
mirrors for each other

00:54:40.948 --> 00:54:42.490 align:middle line:84%
when we're starting
to break through.

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And we can see this
in one another.

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And we should herald that and
respect one another for it.

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:49.900 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like as humanity,
we can be tricked,

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.520 align:middle line:84%
but we can't truly be
controlled in the truest sense

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.320 align:middle line:90%
of the word.

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: Yes.

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And community, as you
have just said, is key.

00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So stay close to your
chosen communities

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and be willing to outreach and
include others in the years

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:04.060 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.810 align:middle line:84%
You will all need each other,
but you will all be stronger

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:09.340 align:middle line:90%
because of each other.

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, a lot
of absolutely necessary

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:16.240 align:middle line:90%
conversation here today.

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: In peace and
in love to you, Regina,

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:20.973 align:middle line:90%
and all of your dear people, ha.

00:55:20.973 --> 00:55:22.015 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And love back.

00:55:22.015 --> 00:55:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:34.810 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I just started
laughing during some of it.

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Just what a wonderful,
wild, direct ride.

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being here and
for not quitting the channeling

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:43.780 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.988 align:middle line:84%
Because I talked to you
through the years many times,

00:55:45.988 --> 00:55:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm really done, this
time I'm really done.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you're not done yet.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>> HARRIS: I'm glad too.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That was beautiful.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Lee.

00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:56.508 align:middle line:84%
Any thoughts of your
own now, not the Z's,

00:55:56.508 --> 00:55:58.300 align:middle line:84%
coming through that
you would like to share

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.218 align:middle line:90%
from the human realm?

00:56:01.218 --> 00:56:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: It's interesting
because I think our biggest

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:06.710 align:middle line:84%
challenge-- and I hear this in
people, I see this in people,

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:07.510 align:middle line:90%
I feel this.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:09.302 align:middle line:84%
And then, I go through
my own layers of it.

00:56:09.302 --> 00:56:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I think our biggest
challenge is, are we OK

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.890 align:middle line:84%
with what we can
see as going on.

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean are
we fundamentally OK

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:17.400 align:middle line:84%
that this is the way
we want things to go.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.910 align:middle line:84%
But how can we navigate
knowing this is a transition?

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's so
important because I

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:27.210 align:middle line:84%
have seen people lose their
way, their faith, their hope.

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
stage of grief that

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.630 align:middle line:84%
happens for you
when you first start

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.830 align:middle line:90%
to learn a lot of this stuff.

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But there is also an
incredible strength.

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:37.500 align:middle line:10%
And I'm really
seeing it in people.

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:40.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm really seeing people who
I would never have thought

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.780 align:middle line:10%
would either be talking
about this kind of stuff

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:45.870 align:middle line:10%
or having experiences
they're having, I'm really

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:46.710 align:middle line:10%
seeing that happen.

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And the Z's have told me
for years that would happen.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.300 align:middle line:84%
But there's always
a delay between what

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.580 align:middle line:84%
they tell me is coming
and me actually as a human

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.460 align:middle line:84%
being able to go, I'm
actually seeing this now.

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:57.880 align:middle line:90%
So I always like that.

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think
hold on to our hats.

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.560 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, hold
on to and nurture our hearts.

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And find the people where our
hearts can resonate and grow

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.035 align:middle line:84%
and be OK with some of the
changes that so many of us

00:57:11.035 --> 00:57:13.410 align:middle line:84%
are being asked to go through
right now because there are

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:18.120 align:middle line:84%
relationship changes, people
are moving in different ways

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.230 align:middle line:90%
together in the ocean.

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:21.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's as it's meant to be.

00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and love,
back to the frequency of love.

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Find your little love
spot, your sweet spot.

00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I have often said to
people, who loves you?

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Then go there now.

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the best place to go.

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Go where you're loved
and where you feel love.

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Because many people are new
to some of these concepts.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.252 align:middle line:84%
I've been with them
for a long time,

00:57:41.252 --> 00:57:43.710 align:middle line:84%
so I've been swimming these
waters and can laugh about them

00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and find it just
outrageous and get mad

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and then say, OK, I'm
picking up that sword.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.633 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting
away with this.

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
go through all of it.

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.675 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: You
made a good point.

00:57:53.675 --> 00:57:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So I have a term that I use
when I see something else

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:57.990 align:middle line:90%
going on in the game on Earth.

00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's those F-ers.

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I use the word,
but it's actually--

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's brief,
doesn't last long.

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But you are also allowed
to be annoyed and to be--

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to allow
the spectrum of emotion.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.125 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting,
the Z's were

00:58:12.125 --> 00:58:13.500 align:middle line:84%
quite clear about
that, don't let

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.750 align:middle line:90%
your emotions drive the car.

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, my dear.

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:19.170 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait until next time.

00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to press
them again to say, OK,

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:23.040 align:middle line:84%
are you ready to tell us
the rest of that story?

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.748 align:middle line:84%
>> HARRIS: Great I'll
look forward to it.

00:58:24.748 --> 00:58:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:28.360 align:middle line:10%
The name of the book is
"Conversations with the Z's--
