00:00:27.573 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: In
our last conversation,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:10%
Mitch Horowitz and I spoke about
the early eccentric players

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:10%
in the history of
occultism in America.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:84%
We left off with one of the big
ones, Madame Helena Blavatsky

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and her partner, Colonel
Henry Steel Olcott.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's pick it up from there.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.024 align:middle line:90%
I loved our last conversation.

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MITCH HOROWITZ: Likewise.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It was just a
wonderful romp through this

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.070 align:middle line:84%
really convoluted, weird cast of
characters that became the New

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Age movement, which ended up in,
you know, a network like Gaia,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:84%
It really started
with these guys.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.350 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes, it really did.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:10%
Everything that we do really
stands on their shoulders.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing how much of modern
life, not only in the new age,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.695 align:middle line:10%
but you find the influence in
presidents like FDR and Ronald

00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:14.495 align:middle line:10%
Reagan.

00:01:14.495 --> 00:01:16.286 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I love those
parts of the story.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have another
two part conversation.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
to both of those eras.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's start out with
Blavatsky and Olcott.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was influenced by
someone called the Poughkeepsie

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.857 align:middle line:90%
Seer as a little kid.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.965 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Launch in and start
telling us our bedtime stories.

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Well, you really
just captured the history

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:84%
of the new age in a
nutshell, actually.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.470 align:middle line:84%
In the mid-19th century,
there was a young kid

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:84%
named Andrew Jackson
Davis who lived

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
in the town of Poughkeepsie in
the Hudson Valley in New York

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:10%
And he was experimenting
with mesmerism, more of what

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:10%
we today would call hypnosis.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And in 1840s, he
discovered that he

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.390 align:middle line:84%
could go into these trance
states and as he reported,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:84%
he traveled to other
worlds, other dimensions,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:90%
other planets.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:10%
And Andrew would return
back to consciousness

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:10%
and he would give lectures
and he would dictate things

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:10%
that he learned about
the cosmos and the nature

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:10%
of the human mind and where
we go in the afterlife

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:10%
while he was in these
out-of-body trances.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:10%
And in the press,
they made fun of him

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:10%
and called him the
Poughkeepsie Seer.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But he took to it and instead
of treating it as a joke,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:84%
he embraced the label
and he became famous

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:90%
all around the nation.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:10%
And a young man, it turns
out, from New York City

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.480 align:middle line:10%
named Henry Steel Olcott
travels up by train

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:10%
to Poughkeepsie one day.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe about 90 minutes
outside of New York City

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle line:90%
by train, north of the city.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And he sees the
Poughkeepsie Seer enter

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:90%
into one of these trances.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:90%
He sits for one of his sessions.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Davis was the person
who popularized the term seance

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:84%
He would refer to contact with
the after world as seances.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So Henry Olcott travels
up to Poughkeepsie

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:84%
as a kid to witness
one of these seances.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And that begins for him
a lifelong fascination

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.740 align:middle line:90%
with the occult.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because he was
doing a medical diagnosis,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:90%
as I recall.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Henry
had a career that

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:84%
was almost impossible
to encapsulate.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.740 align:middle line:10%
He was a journalist, he was an
investigator, he was a lawyer,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:10%
he was a staff Colonel
in the Civil War.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
He covered the execution of
the abolitionist John Brown

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:90%
for newspapers in the Northeast.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.772 align:middle line:10%
Even if he hadn't gotten
involved in the occult,

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:10%
he would have been a
notable personality.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:10%
But that day in
Poughkeepsie, when

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:10%
he witnessed this young kid
going into a trance state, that

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:10%
began his fascination with the
occult. In a certain sense,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.890 align:middle line:10%
that was where the New
Age began in our country

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:10%
because Henry's
interests just had

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:10%
a seismic effect on everything.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about
his work that was going on also

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
in the area of agriculture,
advanced agriculture, as well.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, talk about a
man of many talents.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he reminds me of a
couple other people in history

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that just had extreme curiosity,
intelligence, and genius

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:90%
in many areas--

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:84%
so naturally, the
extent to this.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.045 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about his
background in agriculture.

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:19.640 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: He was, in addition
to all the things we've been

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:10%
discussing, he was a
scientific agriculturalist.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:10%
And he wrote a book at
the onset of the Civil War

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:10%
about a special
syrup that could be

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:10%
grown in mixed climate
environments that

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:10%
could substitute for sugar.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that Northerners
were very interested in this

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
is that when the North
and South went to war,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:84%
it cut off the North's access
to the South's sugar products.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:10%
So Henry comes
along and he writes

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:10%
a book about a form
of syrup and sweetener

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:10%
that actually originated
in China that can grow

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:10%
in mixed climate areas such as
the Northeastern United States.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And the book became
a minor sensation

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.839 align:middle line:90%
because it solved a problem--

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
at least one of the
economic problems

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:84%
that the North was experiencing
at the outset of the Civil War.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And Henry was offered chairs in
both American and international

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:84%
universities as the head
of scientific agriculture.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.100 align:middle line:84%
He didn't take
that job but he did

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
run an experimental
agricultural farm in New Jersey.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.305 align:middle line:84%
That was one of his
many enterprises.

00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and of
course, he ended up an auditor

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.527 align:middle line:84%
for the contractors
in the Civil War.

00:05:37.527 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.662 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How did that figure
in and what did that result in?

00:05:41.662 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Just incredible.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Henry went into the Civil
War as a signals officer.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:10%
And he got sick and was pulled
out of action for a while.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:10%
And then he was
considered to be such

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:10%
a keen scientific and
journalistic mind,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:10%
that he was actually
appointed to a special office

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:10%
as the chief
investigator of fraud

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:10%
among military contractors.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:10%
And in order to give weight--

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.770 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Whoa, where is
he when we need him today?

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Can you imagine?

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Henry would have gotten along
just fine in the 21st century.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And in order to lend
weight and give him

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:84%
authority as an
investigator, he was

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:84%
promoted to the position
of staff Colonel.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So Henry and a team
of investigators

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:84%
looked into the doings of
various military contractors

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
who were over-billing
the Union Army.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:10%
And he later received
a special commendation

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:10%
from the Secretary of War for
saving the Union thousands

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:10%
upon thousands of dollars
that was being bilked out

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:10%
by crooked contractors.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.530 align:middle line:10%
And after the war, Henry and
his team of investigators

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:10%
were actually summoned to
Washington DC following

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.780 align:middle line:10%
Lincoln's assassination.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And they actually made some
of the first interrogations

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and arrests in
pursuit of discovering

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:84%
who Lincoln's assassin
was in the hours and days

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
just following
the assassination.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because he was known
for this incredibly analytical,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:90%
strategic mind?

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: That's it.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
He was considered a great
investigator and one

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:84%
of the most successful
military prosecutors,

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
military investigators
of his time.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And so he was a
natural pick when--

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.680 align:middle line:84%
there was chaos immediately
after Lincoln's assassination.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:10%
The authorities didn't know
how many assassins were there,

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:10%
was there some sort
of conspiracy afoot,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:10%
where did this originate from?

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:10%
And Henry and his team
actually conducted

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.724 align:middle line:10%
some of the very first
investigations and arrests

00:07:32.724 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:10%
as they were trying to piece
together what happened.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.315 align:middle line:84%
Are there any notable
biographies on his life?

00:07:39.315 --> 00:07:42.007 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: There are
a couple out there.

00:07:42.007 --> 00:07:43.590 align:middle line:84%
It's funny that you
ask that question.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, he's
a polarizing figure.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So people write about him
either in a hagiographic way

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:84%
where, you know, Henry
practically walked on water.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.390 align:middle line:10%
Or he's written about when
academic writers write

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:10%
about him in a manner
that tends to be

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:10%
very dismissive of his
occult interests, you know.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:84%
There will be
respectful attention

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:84%
paid to these other
parts of his career,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
as a scientific agriculturalist,
as a military investigator.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as
Henry crossed over

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.419 align:middle line:84%
into interest in the occult
and Buddhism and so forth,

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:84%
he's treated almost
like a carnival barker.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:10%
So that's one of the
gaps in the literature

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.245 align:middle line:10%
that I've tried to
fill in my work.

00:08:22.245 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Why don't
you write a book on him?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:90%
What a fascinating person.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: He became a hero
to me as I was working on Occult

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:10%
America.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:10%
And I devoted a couple of
chapters to him in that book.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:10%
He really did become
something of a hero to me.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Because when I began
Occult America,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
my intention was,
yes, of course,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'll mention Henry
Olcott and Madame Blavatsky

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:90%
and theosophy.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.070 align:middle line:10%
But I came to realize
that everything

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:10%
that we're a part of, everything
that the new age culture is

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.725 align:middle line:10%
about has its foundation
in Henry Olcott, theosophy,

00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:10%
and Madame Blavatsky.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.864 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they introduced
so much into the culture

00:08:54.864 --> 00:08:55.905 align:middle line:90%
that they were catalysts.

00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he was
such a substantial man.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:90%
And she a woman.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So now the war is over, OK,
so it's now 1870s, mid-1870s.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And now he's-- is he introduced
to what you describe as this

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:90%
strange Russian woman.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.814 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:09:11.814 --> 00:09:13.438 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Immediately
after the war,

00:09:13.438 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
Henry's working as a lawyer.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:10%
And you'll love this.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:10%
Not only is he a lawyer
but he becomes involved

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.140 align:middle line:10%
in writing some of
the earliest laws that

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:10%
govern how insurance can be
marketed and sold in America.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:10%
And Henry was a specialist
in fire insurance

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:10%
and some of the laws that
he helped write are still

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:10%
on the books in New York state.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:10%
Laws that require you to
have fire insurance and that

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.350 align:middle line:10%
govern how it's sold.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:10%
So you know, this is just
Thursday afternoon for Henry.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:10%
He also got very interested
at the time in Spiritualism,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.040 align:middle line:10%
seances, table rapping,
talking to the dead, which

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:10%
was, of course,
sweeping the country.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:10%
Something that we talked about
in our previous discussion.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.777 align:middle line:10%
And Henry was bored
with being a lawyer.

00:09:54.777 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:10%
He didn't want to spend
the rest of his life

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:10%
as a specialist
in fire insurance.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.350 align:middle line:10%
So he gravitated
toward journalism.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.500 align:middle line:10%
And he began to investigate
seances and the claims

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:10%
of spirit mediums and so forth.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote actually
a very good book

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
that you can still find
online called People

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
From the Other World, which
was his record of investigating

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
trance mediums and
seances and such.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And what was his--

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in there, tell us
what was his position on this.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: Oh, he felt it was
a mixture of fraud and truth.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.821 align:middle line:10%
He said, you know, you really
have both things going on

00:10:24.821 --> 00:10:26.070 align:middle line:10%
in this world.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:10%
And so in pursuit of
his investigations,

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:10%
Henry gets lured up to
a farmhouse in Vermont

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:10%
where there's a pair of mediums.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle line:10%
They're brothers,
the Eddie brothers,

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:10%
who have nightly sittings
where they manifest supposedly

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.820 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of phenomenon.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:84%
They perform for people from the
Northeast who kind of come up

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
there and they spend
a couple of nights

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and they get treated to ghostly
bugles and the appearance

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:84%
and disappearance
of Indian squaws

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and other supposed spirits that
the Eddies are conjuring up.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So Henry shows up there
just to investigate matters

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and he's standing on the
porch of the Eddie brothers'

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.780 align:middle line:90%
farmhouse.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:10%
And he is asked to
light a cigarette

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:10%
by this enormous
hugely impressive

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:10%
hypnotic-eyed Russian woman
who tells him that she just

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:10%
got back from Italy
where she fought

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:10%
with the forces of a
man named Garibaldi who

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:10%
was a Freemason who was
fighting for a democratic Italy

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:10%
at the time.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And he was a very
Avant Garde figure,

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
he was a figure who
excited a lot of romance.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:10%
And he found it hard to
believe but she showed him

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.500 align:middle line:10%
a couple of injuries
that she said

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.630 align:middle line:10%
she had sustained in battle.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:10%
And they got to talking
and they discovered

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:10%
they both had a shared
passion for the occult, which

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.620 align:middle line:10%
is why they were at the
Eddie brothers farmhouse.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:10%
And Madame Blavatsky, as
she identified herself,

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:10%
told Henry that she
was born in Russia,

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:10%
had traveled the world,
been to India, Tibet.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:10%
But it was America
that she wanted

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:10%
to come to because
America, as she put it,

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:10%
was the birthplace
of Spiritualism,

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:10%
the cradle of Spiritualism.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And she also was deeply enamored
of the religious freedom

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.080 align:middle line:84%
that was already enshrined
in American life.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And she thought this
was a great place

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:84%
to begin her studies into
an occult philosophy,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
a hidden philosophy, a secret
doctrine, as she put it,

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
that she said underscored
all of our religious faith.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.370 align:middle line:84%
She believed there was this
hidden, primeval doctrine.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Occult knowledge.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Occult knowledge
that was like an underground

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:84%
river out of which all
contemporary faiths grew.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:84%
But humanity had
forgotten it, had lost

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:84%
this primordial wisdom,
the occult wisdom.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to rediscover
it, recapture it, bring it

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.440 align:middle line:90%
to light among modern people.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:90%
And Henry was entranced.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
He found the
purpose of his life.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
talk about theosophy.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, who were the influences
that really captured Blavatsky?

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.885 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming this was their
joint or parallel journey.

00:12:58.885 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: It was
a parallel journey.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, Blavatsky
brought to the table

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:10%
a very interesting claim
which remained controversial

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:10%
throughout her career and
remains controversial today.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:10%
She maintained that for
all her world travels,

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:10%
for all her wide reading,
her true influences

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:10%
were these mahatmas or great
souls, these hidden masters,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:10%
these hidden adepts from
Tibet, from India, from Persia,

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:10%
from Egypt, from other
parts of the world.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.060 align:middle line:84%
She said there were
these learned beings who

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:84%
had reached kind of apotheosis
of human development.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.010 align:middle line:10%
And they were her tutors,
they were her goads,

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:10%
they were her guides.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones who set
her on her journey to America.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And said to her, this
is a land of destiny.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:10%
America, as they
put it, is a kind

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:10%
of holy grail among nations.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
religious liberty that

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:84%
exists in American life, which
was unparalleled anywhere

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:84%
in the world at
that time, you will

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:84%
be free to undertake your
occult investigations there

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:84%
without molestation,
without being

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.905 align:middle line:90%
jailed, without harassment.

00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And these things had happened
to her back home in Russia,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So she said that she
was sent to America

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.090 align:middle line:84%
by these hidden
masters, these adepts.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And they would
communicate with Blavatsky

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.334 align:middle line:84%
and later with Henry through a
series of letters and so forth.

00:14:25.334 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:10%
And this became
very controversial

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:10%
and remains very controversial.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
The letters that she
said were sent to her

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.150 align:middle line:84%
by the mahatmas are actually now
housed in the British Library

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and people still
fight over them.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Some claim that these letters
were phenomenologically

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
produced, that there's
actually no imprint of a quill,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
of the tip of a
pen on the paper.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And you know, these arguments
go on today in the 21st century

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:84%
as if we were still living in
the mid- to late 19th century,

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.960 align:middle line:90%
that the fire's still burn.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.675 align:middle line:84%
But that was her claim,
that was her claim.

00:14:59.675 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And among those
was also Francis Bacon saying

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.530 align:middle line:90%
the same thing.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
This kind of new
thought is going

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.287 align:middle line:84%
to happen in that new world,
America, even back then.

00:15:07.287 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And this was not--

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, adepts of all
kinds, including him,

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:84%
believed that America was
going to be the birthplace

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:90%
of the new thinking.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And there were many,
many such people.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes they
went under the name

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:10%
of groups like the
Rosicrucians or the Freemasons

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:10%
and so on and so forth.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:31.060 align:middle line:10%
But it was a point of view among
the Avant Garde intelligentsia

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:10%
that there was going to be
some new thought system born

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:10%
in the modern world
and that it was

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:10%
going to be born
in America because

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:10%
of the relative degree
of religious freedom

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:10%
that existed there.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:10%
That was her point of view.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.131 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what these adepts
were telling her essentially

00:15:47.131 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
was that this transcends
any religious dogma.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.475 align:middle line:84%
They're going to hidden deeper
truths of the nature of reality

00:15:54.475 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:84%
The cosmos, reality, and
that extends into every area.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>> HOROWITZ: Right.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:10%
And she took that
ethic to a point

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:10%
where she articulated
the basic equality

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:10%
of all the historic
faiths, the quality

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:10%
of all religious and
spiritual experiences.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.005 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As the
hermetics do to this day.

00:16:16.005 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: As
the hermetics do.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:84%
A brotherhood and
sisterhood among all people.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, in some
regards, all of that

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:90%
sounds fairly ordinary today.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.010 align:middle line:90%
We think of that as good civics.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:10%
Although it's under
assault, it's under assault.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
sensitive people

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:90%
regard that as good civics.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:10%
But this wasn't something
that modern people commonly

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:10%
heard in the 1870s.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.450 align:middle line:10%
This was extraordinary.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this country
had just completed

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.300 align:middle line:10%
this horrific civil war.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Based over really
lower thinking on all levels.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It was just greed in resources
and financers and financiers

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Aluminum money.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:57.390 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: And in the
balance was a sense of a common

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:10%
humanity.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.950 align:middle line:10%
People's humanity was degraded.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:10%
And here you have this Russian
woman saying, I'm here,

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm visiting the
cradle of Spiritualism;

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:10%
the cradle of the
new spirituality.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:84%
And honoring this idea that
all religions converge.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:84%
Which again, today,
is good civics.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.720 align:middle line:84%
But back then was an
extraordinary message.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.468 align:middle line:84%
And Americans heard
it, they heard it.

00:17:19.468 --> 00:17:21.009 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
reason they heard it,

00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
you know, people criticize
her for being controversial

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and people call her
fraudulent and say,

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:84%
you know, she was the equivalent
of a carnival performer.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:90%
Here's what they misunderstand.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Some of her ethics had
been articulated earlier

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
by Emerson and Thoreau and
the transcendentalists.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
But almost because of
her theatrical persona,

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:84%
she was a popular figure in
the press, the press loved her.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So when she would talk about
the equality of all religions,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.760 align:middle line:84%
those things would make
it into newspapers.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if, you know, Ralph
Waldo Emerson or Bronson Alcott

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:84%
said it, it would
reach a certain segment

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.230 align:middle line:90%
of the American public.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:10%
But Madame Blavatsky made
for a good evening reading,

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:10%
good Sunday reading.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.116 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She was brilliant.

00:18:05.116 --> 00:18:06.490 align:middle line:84%
She was brilliant
intellectually,

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.573 align:middle line:90%
but she was a charismatic.

00:18:07.573 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ:
Tremendously charismatic.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And her ability to be
a kind of thespian,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.610 align:middle line:84%
her ability to make herself
into this sensational figure,

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and she was a self-made
figure, it made her famous.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:90%
It gave her an entree.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:84%
It allowed her
message to resonate.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, sure, there were
some other people around,

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Quakers and Unitarians
and others, who

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:84%
may have been enunciating
some of these ethics.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.234 align:middle line:84%
But this occult
Russian noble woman,

00:18:32.234 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
she's the one who brought
it to American ears.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Meanwhile,
going back to Olcott, now,

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.295 align:middle line:84%
somewhere along the way, he
became involved with Thomas

00:18:40.295 --> 00:18:41.095 align:middle line:90%
Edison.

00:18:41.095 --> 00:18:43.017 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: Oh, yeah.

00:18:43.017 --> 00:18:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're going to
do these parallel paths.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.375 align:middle line:90%
And these two were partners.

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:48.041 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: That's
right, that's right.

00:18:48.041 --> 00:18:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Talk about what our kids don't
learn in school, you know.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Edison was an early member
of Theosophical Society.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.730 align:middle line:84%
The Theosophical Society
was the occult organization

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle line:84%
that Madame Blavatsky
and Henry Olcott formed

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:90%
in New York City in 1875.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:84%
For the express
purpose of uncovering

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
this occult or primeval
philosophy that they felt

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:90%
underscored all religions.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:10%
And early members included
Thomas Edison and Major General

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:10%
Abner Doubleday, who
is reputed to have

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:10%
invented the game of baseball.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Not actually the case but
that was what made him famous.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:10%
Edison would get together with
Madame Blavatsky and Olcott

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:10%
in a little cramped
apartment that they had

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:10%
on the West side of Manhattan.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:10%
It's still there, I take
people there on tours.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:10%
It's at the corner of 8th
Avenue and 47th Street.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:10%
And the press called
it the Lamasery.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.510 align:middle line:90%
The name of a Tibetan monastery.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you know,
this is the place where

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:84%
everything weird is going
on for New Yorkers who

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.180 align:middle line:90%
are interested in the occult.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was this weird
cramped little collection

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:84%
of rooms where
people would gather

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.940 align:middle line:84%
to hold seances
and go into trances

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and debate Kabbalah and other
topics, talk about Buddhism,

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and things that were
new to the Western mind.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.030 align:middle line:10%
Edison was a regular
at these meetings.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And he told Henry
Olcott that he was

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:10%
intent on creating
a machine that

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:10%
could detect the ethereal
presence of spirits,

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:10%
of nonphysical entities.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:10%
That he was determined to bring
scientific rigor to the sands

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:10%
table.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And Edison did, over
the course of his life,

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:84%
experiment with certain
kinds of machines like that.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.412 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They'd had electrodes
connected to the head.

00:20:36.412 --> 00:20:38.078 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: That's
right, that's right.

00:20:38.078 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Electrodes connected
to the head.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And he also created some
sort of a machine that

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:84%
was this very enormously
sensitive, like,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:84%
light sensor that was intended
to be able to pick up--

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's almost
a plasma kind of--

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> HOROWITZ: Yeah, any kind of
nonphysical presence or light

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.380 align:middle line:84%
source in an otherwise
darkened room.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And so Edison experimented
with these things,

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:90%
but it spoke to the times.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:10%
It spoke to the times because
this was in the 1870s.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:10%
Blavatsky and Olcott
left America to journey

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.730 align:middle line:10%
to India in early 1878.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But there was an Avant
Garde culture growing up

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
in the wake of the
Civil War, and they

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
were interested in
questioning everything.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't as if you
had people of science

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:84%
on one side and people who were
interested in the nonphysical,

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.000 align:middle line:84%
or the paranormal,
on the other side.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
You could, in the form
of somebody like Edison,

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:84%
have someone who was just
fascinated with questioning

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:90%
all old orthodoxies.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And they
didn't see themselves

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:84%
as these figures on
the fringes of society.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.342 align:middle line:84%
They saw themselves as
people who were fulfilling

00:21:47.342 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:90%
the promise of enlightenment.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.230 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
question religion,

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
question matters of the
spirit, understand science.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.700 align:middle line:90%
It was an exciting time.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just as a
little aside, did anything

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:84%
come of those experiments
with the electrodes

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:90%
during seances, and so forth?

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: There have
been journals and diaries,

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.095 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have a piece of
technology that's come down

00:22:08.095 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:90%
to us today, where we can--

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no,
I'm just wondering

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.131 align:middle line:90%
what their notes may have said.

00:22:11.131 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Did they notice anything?

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: You have different
claims and counterclaims.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Edison said that he did
have some experiments

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.495 align:middle line:84%
where he had some progress
and some frustrations.

00:22:22.495 --> 00:22:23.454 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK, OK.

00:22:23.454 --> 00:22:24.994 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah,
nothing conclusive.

00:22:24.994 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.639 align:middle line:84%
So now they go to
India, you just

00:22:27.639 --> 00:22:28.930 align:middle line:90%
talked about that a second ago.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:90%
They go to India.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And he was a hero among the
Buddhist population as well,

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.370 align:middle line:84%
in India, aside from
all of this in the US.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's go there.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: This was a whole
other phase of Henry's career.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, first,
why did they leave?

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.980 align:middle line:84%
After that kind of attention and
success in the United States,

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.890 align:middle line:84%
why did they leave for
India to begin with?

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, it's
just extraordinary.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.350 align:middle line:84%
While they were
in New York City,

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:84%
they completed Madam
Blavatsky's first book,

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.180 align:middle line:84%
which was called "ISIS
Unveiled," which is actually

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:90%
my favorite of her books.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.960 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of an
occult encyclopedia

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:10%
and it's the first place
we talk a lot today

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:10%
about the Akashic records, the
existence of Akashic records.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:10%
She was the one who introduced
that concept into Western life,

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:10%
and the first
enunciation of there

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:10%
being some kind
of Akashic records

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:10%
can be found in "ISIS Unveiled."

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.180 align:middle line:84%
It later got developed
by other people.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.680 align:middle line:84%
She later returned
to it in the book

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.070 align:middle line:84%
called "The Secret Doctrine,"
which came out in 1888.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:24.850 align:middle line:10%
But "ISIS Unveiled,"
which appeared in 1877,

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:10%
gives us our first
articulation of some notion

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:10%
of there being Akashic records.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:84%
That's just one
of many, many ways

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.246 align:middle line:84%
in which she gave us the
vocabulary that we even

00:23:35.246 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:90%
use in the New Age culture.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.780 align:middle line:90%
She was remarkable.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, she and Henry
finish up this book.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And as he describes
it, one night,

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:84%
he is dozing off
at the apartment

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
that they share on the
west side of Manhattan.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:53.830 align:middle line:10%
And he says that this turbaned,
ethereal figure just appears

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:10%
in front of him and offers
him words of encouragement,

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.807 align:middle line:10%
and talks to him about
the work he's doing,

00:23:59.807 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:10%
and where they must go, and
what they must do, and tells

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:10%
him, your next sojourn,
you and Madam Blavatsky,

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:10%
together, must be to India.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Because India is the cradle of
one of the oldest civilizations

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and religions, Hinduism, and it
is currently being chipped away

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:90%
by Western colonial efforts.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And you need to go
to India and you

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
need to instigate a rebirth
of the traditional religions--

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Buddhism, Hinduism.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And something more--
you need to go to India

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:90%
and help free the nation.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:10%
So on this instigation,
which Henry writes about

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.780 align:middle line:10%
very vividly in a book
of his called "Old Diary

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:10%
Leaves," the first volume, he
and Madam Blavatsky pick up.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:10%
And in early 1878, they
decide, well, we're

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.510 align:middle line:10%
being given our new assignment.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:10%
We're being given our
new orders, so to speak.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:10%
And they sojourn to
India, a nation where

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:10%
they don't know the language.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:10%
Neither of them are in
particularly good health.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:10%
She's extremely obese.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.560 align:middle line:10%
Henry suffers from a gouty leg.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.010 align:middle line:10%
And I often tell people, try to
imagine the physical courage.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.350 align:middle line:10%
Try to imagine the
physical courage.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:10%
In New York City in 1878, you
could live a fairly good life.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It was very affordable to
have servants in your home.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.490 align:middle line:84%
You could take a train
out to Coney Island.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:10%
There were restaurants,
there were theaters,

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.350 align:middle line:10%
there was ice for your drinks.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It could be a reasonably
comfortable life

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:90%
if you had middle-class means.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.350 align:middle line:90%
They leave all of that.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:90%
They leave all of that.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:10%
Well into middle-age and
not in the best of health,

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:10%
they sojourn to
India, where they

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.320 align:middle line:10%
don't know the language, where
they have no contacts, where

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:10%
they have no employment,
or economic prospects.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.530 align:middle line:10%
They uproot themselves.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:10%
And Henry begins to travel
around India, Sri Lanka, even

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:56.750 align:middle line:10%
as far as Japan, and talk about
the need to revive Buddhism.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:84%
He starts a program of
opening Buddhist schools.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time that some
people of that generation

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:84%
are even hearing a Westerner
talk about the values

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.880 align:middle line:84%
of Eastern religion, because
most Westerners with whom

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.310 align:middle line:84%
people in the East
would come into contact,

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.100 align:middle line:84%
would either be military,
or colonial officials,

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
or missionaries who
are trying to get

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:84%
them to dispense with the old
faith, so that's superstition.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.453 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly, right.

00:26:23.453 --> 00:26:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Which was actually
what that generation was doing.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.350 align:middle line:10%
Buddhist and Hindu
practice was withering

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:10%
in many parts of India
because the missionary efforts

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.919 align:middle line:10%
were tied in with the machinery
of colonial governance.

00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And the missioners were
actually very successful.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So the two of them
locate to India.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.730 align:middle line:10%
They instigate a
Buddhist revolution.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:84%
They instigate a revival
of traditional Hinduism.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.700 align:middle line:10%
And astonishingly enough,
and this is something

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:10%
that most of our historians
have never really wrapped

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:10%
their minds around,
they help instigate

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.620 align:middle line:10%
the Indian
Independence Movement.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:10%
They are founding members of the
Indian National Congress, which

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.780 align:middle line:10%
was the policy-making board
of the Indian Independence

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.590 align:middle line:10%
Movement.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.470 align:middle line:10%
Later Blavatsky flees
India because of scandals.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.860 align:middle line:84%
She tended to be dogged by
scandals throughout her life.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:16.740 align:middle line:10%
She meets a young Gandhi
in London in the late 1880s

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.020 align:middle line:10%
while she's completing
"The Secret Doctrine."

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
He is absolutely floored and
astonished to meet this woman

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:84%
because he was part of a
generation that considered

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:84%
the old religions just nonsense
and superstition that belonged

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.225 align:middle line:90%
to his parents' generation.

00:27:31.225 --> 00:27:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was part of
academia, in that sense.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He was
part of academia.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to be a right
and proper barrister.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.415 align:middle line:84%
He dressed in a proper
English coat and collar

00:27:38.415 --> 00:27:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and parted his
hair in the middle.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.230 align:middle line:10%
And he was trying to fit
in with Western society.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:10%
And he listened to Blavatsky
and he wrote about this,

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.090 align:middle line:10%
up till his death, in
letters, diaries, articles.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:10%
He was very forthright about it.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:90%
He listened to Blavatsky.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.860 align:middle line:10%
And he said for the first
time, for the first time,

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:10%
I heard someone talking
about my religion, Hinduism,

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.940 align:middle line:10%
as something that was filled
with dignity and wisdom

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:10%
and ideas, and that could
be a guide to life, not just

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.950 align:middle line:10%
an outdated superstition.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.990 align:middle line:10%
And through her
influence, he returned

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:10%
to reading "The Bhagavad Gita,"
which he, earlier in life,

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.760 align:middle line:10%
had dismissed.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.030 align:middle line:10%
And he came to embrace it
as the guide to his life.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:10%
And what's more, what's
more, he was electrified

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:10%
when he heard Madam
Blavatsky talk

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:10%
about the idea of
universal brotherhood

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.400 align:middle line:10%
and the commonality
of all races,

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:10%
and the commonality
of all religions.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And this moved
him, this moved him

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.230 align:middle line:84%
toward his first conception
of his own philosophy

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.619 align:middle line:84%
of nonviolence and
universal brotherhood.

00:28:39.619 --> 00:28:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the word that
came up even in the day was

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:42.615 align:middle line:90%
'the white brotherhood.'

00:28:42.615 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.229 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now this has
been seriously misunderstood--

00:28:47.229 --> 00:28:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Very much so.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --throughout history.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what that actually

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.040 align:middle line:84%
meant, being
rendered in that time

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:90%
through her lens of thinking.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Right, it certainly
doesn't connote anything racial

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:58.170 align:middle line:90%
in any way.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.270 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the members of
The White Brotherhood,

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.430 align:middle line:10%
which she said were
a group of adepts,

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:04.479 align:middle line:10%
were largely from
non-Western nations,

00:29:04.479 --> 00:29:06.270 align:middle line:10%
some of the ones I was
mentioning earlier--

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.620 align:middle line:10%
Persia India,
Tibet, and so forth.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.007 align:middle line:84%
And she maintained, she
and Henry maintained

00:29:11.007 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:84%
till the end of their
lives, that these were

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:90%
the figures who guided them.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.100 align:middle line:84%
That these were the figures
who delivered them to India.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.040 align:middle line:10%
And I often say to
historians and people

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:10%
who are studying
their lives that even

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:10%
if you want to dismiss that
as metaphor, as fantasy--

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.480 align:middle line:10%
you can call it
fraud if you want to.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:10%
But the fact is, you take
a look at the physical

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.230 align:middle line:10%
and intellectual strength
that it took for this couple

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.150 align:middle line:10%
to move from New
York City to India,

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.030 align:middle line:10%
and to undertake the things
that we've just talked about--

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:10%
and what I was
describing about Gandhi?

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:10%
The sources for that are
Gandhi's own letters,

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:10%
journals, articles,
interviews that he gave up

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:10%
until the end of his life.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I have all of it sourced
in "Occult America."

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to find.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:10%
What it's difficult to do is
to wrap one's mind around it,

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:10%
because if you wrap your
mind around it, what it does

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.080 align:middle line:10%
is it gives you a
whole counter history

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.899 align:middle line:10%
of our lives in the modern era.

00:30:05.899 --> 00:30:06.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: We don't
understand the occult

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.120 align:middle line:10%
as being at the foundation
of contemporary life,

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:16.620 align:middle line:10%
but India today is the largest
democracy in the world.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:10%
Gandhi's was probably the
most significant nonviolent

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.400 align:middle line:10%
revolution in human history.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:10%
And he speaks-- and he spoke
and wrote very forthrightly

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:10%
about Blavatsky
being the catalyst

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.631 align:middle line:10%
for his way of thought.

00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:34.982 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, how did they
hook up with Mary Todd Lincoln?

00:30:34.982 --> 00:30:35.786 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:35.786 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: An
interesting question.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, we could just
talk about this couple all day.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we probably will
for most of the interview.

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so
fascinated with them.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So how'd they hook up
with Mary Todd Lincoln?

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:44.860 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.818 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: The connection
to Mary Todd Lincoln

00:30:46.818 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:10%
is through the thought of Andrew
Jackson Davis, the Poughkeepsie

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:10%
Seer.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:10%
Davis was the one who,
in the late 1840s,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.147 align:middle line:10%
introduced the idea of
seances into American life.

00:30:57.147 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:10%
And there were other
influences, there

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.689 align:middle line:10%
were the Fox sisters, a
pair of teenage girls--

00:31:00.689 --> 00:31:02.521 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right, from
our last conversation.

00:31:02.521 --> 00:31:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --upstate
New York, yes.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And the Fox sisters were
extraordinary catalysts,

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.720 align:middle line:84%
but it was Davis who
wrote things down.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:10%
It was Davis who produced
these massive books,

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.750 align:middle line:10%
and who gave people instructions
in the early 1850s on how

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.960 align:middle line:10%
to form themselves into
seance circles, and so forth.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:10%
And among Davis's
friends and adversaries

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.440 align:middle line:10%
in New York City
in the late 1840s,

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.350 align:middle line:10%
were Edgar Allan
Poe, who attended

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:10%
some of Davis's seances,
and a Reverend George Bush,

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.970 align:middle line:10%
who was a first cousin
four times removed

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.190 align:middle line:10%
to the Bush presidential clan.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And George Bush wrote in
defense of Davis and said,

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I've been at his
trance sittings and I

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:84%
can say, as a biblical
scholar, with certainty,

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.990 align:middle line:84%
that the things he's
saying couldn't come

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:50.180 align:middle line:90%
through any ordinary source.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the young man who,
until a few months ago,

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:84%
was a cobbler's apprentice
up in Poughkeepsie, New York.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.947 align:middle line:84%
And today, know he speaks
in ancient Arabic, Hebrew,

00:31:59.947 --> 00:32:01.280 align:middle line:90%
and he's in these trance states.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.420 align:middle line:84%
There's something
extraordinary going on here.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.340 align:middle line:10%
So Davis, through his public
persona and his writings,

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:10%
helps instigate interest
in Spiritualism.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:10%
And Mary Todd Lincoln takes an
early and impassioned interest

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.820 align:middle line:10%
in Spiritualism.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after she and Abe
Lincoln moved into the White

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
House, they lose a
beloved 10-year-old son

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.660 align:middle line:84%
of theirs, Willie,
to tuberculosis.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:84%
It was a very, very
common story in the day.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, Americans
often don't realize--

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.260 align:middle line:84%
we ask, why did spiritualism
become so popular so quickly?

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:84%
People were in terrible grief
over these childhood diseases

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and there was no such thing at
the time as grief counseling.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:50.030 align:middle line:10%
In Calvinistic Protestantism,
you didn't get counseling.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.150 align:middle line:10%
You didn't get any kind
of therapeutic approach

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.560 align:middle line:10%
to spirituality.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.140 align:middle line:10%
It was a sin-and-salvation
spirituality,

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.890 align:middle line:10%
where you would go to a funeral,
hope that the deceased loved

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:02.694 align:middle line:10%
one or child was in
the hands of the Lord,

00:33:02.694 --> 00:33:03.860 align:middle line:10%
and then you were expected--

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And then whatever
happened was God's will,

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.180 align:middle line:10%
and it didn't make sense
to people a lot of times.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It didn't
make sense to people.

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had to try to
find a way to make sense of it.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right,
and spiritualism served

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:90%
a kind of therapeutic role.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.140 align:middle line:10%
Who knows what was going
on around the seance table

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.210 align:middle line:10%
night after night, after night?

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that long
ago, in a certain sense.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.580 align:middle line:84%
But in other ways, it was
a very different time.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't even know
what darkness is today.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:10%
I mean, darkness as a
physical phenomenon.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.710 align:middle line:84%
You can't darken a room because
there's LED lights everywhere.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:84%
In a darkened room, in the
gaslight or pre-gaslight age,

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:84%
when people were
closer to nature,

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.500 align:middle line:84%
closer to the cycles
of day and night,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
were experimenting for the first
time with mesmerism, hypnotism,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:90%
trance states--

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.790 align:middle line:84%
who knows what was
going on every night

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.400 align:middle line:90%
around those trance sittings?

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.900 align:middle line:10%
That was something in which
Mary Todd was deeply interested,

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.530 align:middle line:10%
as were our friends Olcott
and Madam Blavatsky.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:10%
And she brought seances
into the White House.

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.650 align:middle line:10%
And there was a reporter present
for at least one seance session

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.510 align:middle line:10%
that she and Abe
Lincoln had in the White

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.370 align:middle line:10%
House during the Civil War.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And again, people have
difficulty wrapping their minds

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.280 align:middle line:84%
around this, but I've done
my very best to crunch the

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.800 align:middle line:84%
numbers by looking
at clubs, newspapers,

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:90%
and other civic organizations.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.440 align:middle line:84%
About 10% of adults
in the early 1850s

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.780 align:middle line:90%
were involved with spiritualism.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a minority to be sure,
but a very large minority.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's still
a large number of people.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where did
Nettie Colburn Maynard

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.889 align:middle line:90%
come into the story?

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Because that was really
into a very interesting--

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: A very
interesting story.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.549 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --session
with President Lincoln.

00:34:38.549 --> 00:34:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:42.739 align:middle line:10%
Nettie Colburn Maynard
was a trance medium who

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:10%
was popular in the Northeast--

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.409 align:middle line:10%
Boston, New York, Washington DC.

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:52.850 align:middle line:84%
She was brought into the
White House for a seance

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:53.840 align:middle line:90%
during the Civil War.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.239 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were two seances
occurred in the White House

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.030 align:middle line:90%
during the Civil War.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.350 align:middle line:10%
At one of these seances
there was a reporter present

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:10%
from "The Boston
Gazette," so we have

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.190 align:middle line:10%
a factual, checkable
source for that.

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:10.040 align:middle line:10%
For Nettie's seance, we
have only her memoirs,

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.470 align:middle line:10%
so I can't speak
to its factuality.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:17.210 align:middle line:84%
But her memoirs are very
vivid and her memoirs do jibe

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.610 align:middle line:84%
with Mary Todd
Lincoln's activities,

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and they do place
people at the seance

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:27.180 align:middle line:84%
who are traceable by reportage
and letters of the day

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.830 align:middle line:84%
to having an interest
in spiritualism.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So as a source, I can't say
that it's absolutely valid,

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:33.831 align:middle line:90%
nor can I dismiss it.

00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:35.580 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
difficulties when you're

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.950 align:middle line:90%
a historian of occult history.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.720 align:middle line:84%
One of the chief
questions you face

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.490 align:middle line:84%
is what sources do
you truly believe?

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where's the truth?

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah and why?

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So Nettie writes this very
sensitive, thoughtful memoir.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And she says that
they had a seance

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.900 align:middle line:84%
in the red room
of the White House

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and that she gave Lincoln
a message from the spirit

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:90%
world, which was this--

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.761 align:middle line:84%
that the greatest
thing he would do

00:36:00.761 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:84%
during his presidency and
the thing for which he would

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:06.040 align:middle line:84%
be most remembered would be
the signing of the Emancipation

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Proclamation.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.660 align:middle line:10%
And one of the congressmen who
was present reportedly said

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.667 align:middle line:10%
to him Mr. President,
have you been experiencing

00:36:12.667 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:10%
a great deal of pressure
over whether or not

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.420 align:middle line:10%
to sign this proclamation?

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And Lincoln said, more pressure
than you can possibly imagine.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And so some period
of time later,

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln did, of course, sign
the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The important thing
about this story

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:84%
is not the question
of whether it's

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:36.370 align:middle line:84%
true or false, because
our sources are limited.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:40.090 align:middle line:10%
What's important is that it
underscores how spiritualism

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:44.080 align:middle line:10%
associated itself with
progressive and emancipatory

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.820 align:middle line:10%
politics of the day.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Spiritualists were
abolitionists.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Spiritualists were suffragists.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:10%
There was a
spiritualist newspaper

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.090 align:middle line:10%
called "The Banner of
Light" that started just

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.410 align:middle line:10%
after the Civil War.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And their first editorial,
their first editorial,

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:04.780 align:middle line:84%
was calling for there to be a
ban, a moratorium on the death

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.270 align:middle line:84%
penalty for leaders
of the Confederacy.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:10%
Spiritualism had social
concerns and they saw themselves

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:13.480 align:middle line:10%
as part of the
march of progress.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.600 align:middle line:10%
That's what's significant
about Nettie's story.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.050 align:middle line:10%
Because back in Europe,
back in the old world,

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:23.680 align:middle line:10%
the occultist was regarded
as this somewhat sinister,

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.190 align:middle line:10%
sneaky figure who
maybe was maleficent,

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.070 align:middle line:10%
who hung around on the
fringes of court life,

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:34.390 align:middle line:10%
manipulating nobles, figuring
out ways to gather power.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
That's, of course,
a stereotype and it

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.070 align:middle line:84%
wasn't really true in practice,
but that was the conception

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.180 align:middle line:90%
in the public mind.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:45.910 align:middle line:10%
But here, in America, here
was a new form of occultist,

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.250 align:middle line:10%
a new form of
spiritualist, somebody

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:10%
who saw what they were
doing as in league

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:10%
with the march of progress,
including political progress.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.310 align:middle line:10%
So the idea that Nettie would
say that of all the things she

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:00.100 align:middle line:10%
could have told Lincoln--
advise him on affairs of power

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.210 align:middle line:10%
or the War--

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.420 align:middle line:10%
the things she says she
told him was to sign

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.490 align:middle line:10%
the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:07.979 align:middle line:10%
That was the tone
of spiritualism.

00:38:07.979 --> 00:38:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
was the very thing

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:84%
he was struggling with the most,
because of the pressure on him.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, he certainly
wasn't at that time.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was an
appropriate message.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and I have been to
seances and wild table-tapping,

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
where the table seems to
just take off and run around

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.030 align:middle line:90%
the room on its own.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:26.200 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty wild stuff
when you're involved.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of hyped-up
energy in this room--

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that seems
to animate things.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.094 align:middle line:84%
But OK, so along
that line, we're

00:38:34.094 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:84%
going to move on now to
the story of the Ouija

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Board and its entrance onto
the scene, which was also--

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:41.880 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the dial plate
and alphabet boards--

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.755 align:middle line:84%
it was called the Egyptian
Luck Board, right?

00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:44.555 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
how the Ouija Board came in.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.300 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, it went
under many different names--

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.510 align:middle line:10%
the Talking Board, the Alphabet
Board, the Witching Board,

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.610 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptian Luck Board, and
so forth, and most famously,

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.910 align:middle line:10%
of course, the Ouija Board.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:02.410 align:middle line:10%
There was a newspaper
in northern Ohio in 1886

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.260 align:middle line:10%
that ran a story of a craze
that was popular among Ohio

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:10%
spiritualists.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's important to realize
spiritualism was spread out

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.050 align:middle line:90%
across the country.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just in the
salons of New York City,

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:90%
or Princeton, New Jersey.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.420 align:middle line:90%
It was everywhere.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So spiritualists living in
northern Ohio got an idea.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.430 align:middle line:10%
It was a very American
idea, and it was this notion

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.400 align:middle line:10%
that, hey, you know what?

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:10%
We're going to cut
out the middleman.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.010 align:middle line:10%
Why do we need to have some sort
of a spirit medium conducting

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.120 align:middle line:10%
us to the other side?

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To seances
and such, yeah.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.810 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Right, we'll
pierce the veil ourselves.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:41.680 align:middle line:10%
So spiritualists began to
invent all sort of devices.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.820 align:middle line:84%
The idea was that you could
use these devices to produce

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.940 align:middle line:84%
automatic writing, or
somehow conduct messages

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
from the spirit world right
at your own kitchen table.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.980 align:middle line:90%
It was very American.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the devices
that they produced

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and that took off in northern
Ohio was the Alphabet Board.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's an article
in the newspaper showing

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:84%
a picture that is the spitting
image of what we call the Ouija

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.170 align:middle line:90%
Board, from 1886.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:14.590 align:middle line:10%
And even the illustration
that the newspaper

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:17.980 align:middle line:10%
ran of a couple, a man and
a woman, using the board

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.060 align:middle line:10%
was almost identical, but
for style of clothing,

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:10%
to the same image
that later appeared

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.320 align:middle line:10%
on the back of the box
of the Ouija Board,

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.050 align:middle line:10%
and did for many decades, which
was a man and a woman sitting

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.750 align:middle line:10%
across from one another,
somewhat flirtatiously

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.870 align:middle line:10%
balancing the Ouija Board
on their knees between them,

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:39.520 align:middle line:10%
and guiding a planchet, or
this little triangular plank,

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.940 align:middle line:10%
across the board to spell
out a spirit message.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So a group of novelty
manufacturers in the city

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:49.600 align:middle line:90%
of Baltimore get wind of this.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And in 1890, they
decide to patent it

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.130 align:middle line:84%
as the Ouija Board, or
the Egyptian Luck Board.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:01.190 align:middle line:10%
They get awarded their
patent in February of 1891.

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:05.830 align:middle line:10%
And thus, is born the Ouija
Board, this occult technology

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.870 align:middle line:10%
from the age of
spiritualism, that

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.830 align:middle line:10%
still can be found today at
slumber parties, in basements,

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:12.910 align:middle line:10%
in toy rooms.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:18.640 align:middle line:84%
You can buy it off the rack at
Toys 'R Us, or in drugstores.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.909 align:middle line:84%
And this is an object from
the age of spiritualism

00:41:20.909 --> 00:41:21.950 align:middle line:90%
and it's absolutely wild.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's fascinating.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And on a personal
note, Sheila Gillette,

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.980 align:middle line:84%
who is another one of our
guests, she's a channeler,

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.720 align:middle line:84%
she started with
the Ouija Board.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:28.895 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:41:28.895 --> 00:41:29.695 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:41:29.695 --> 00:41:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She and I, when we
talked the first time years

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.880 align:middle line:90%
ago, I said, that's funny.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.338 align:middle line:84%
That's the same
thing that happened

00:41:35.338 --> 00:41:38.110 align:middle line:84%
to me when I started that
opening up journey, one day.

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Just we were playing
with the Ouija Board

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and then the Ouija Board
said, go get a pencil.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the pencil said,
go to the typewriter.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.217 align:middle line:84%
And it just kept going on
until I finally realized well,

00:41:49.217 --> 00:41:50.800 align:middle line:84%
there's something
else happening here,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.082 align:middle line:84%
because it certainly doesn't
feel like my thoughts.

00:41:53.082 --> 00:41:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure whose
thoughts they are.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I, like
a lot of other people,

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.240 align:middle line:84%
started, really, on this
kind of pedestrian level

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.490 align:middle line:84%
onto a journey that started
blasting through other layers,

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:05.290 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.108 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
thing is about it

00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:10.965 align:middle line:84%
that even then, and
certainly even-- and now,

00:42:10.965 --> 00:42:13.090 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of controversy
around the Ouija Board

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:15.400 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know
exactly what it is we're

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.670 align:middle line:90%
opening up to, right?

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it'll
even say, danger.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: You are
opening a doorway.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:25.810 align:middle line:10%
And whether that doorway
is to some other realm,

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:28.880 align:middle line:10%
or whether that doorway is
to your own subconscious,

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.760 align:middle line:10%
something is there and
something is happening.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of frightening stories

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.690 align:middle line:90%
about the Ouija Board.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:38.470 align:middle line:10%
And I receive more emails
and social media messages

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.140 align:middle line:10%
from people who have had
horrifying experiences

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:45.070 align:middle line:10%
with the Ouija Board than
I do on any other topic.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.900 align:middle line:10%
Now when people have
bad experiences,

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.250 align:middle line:10%
it often follows a pattern.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:50.770 align:middle line:10%
And the pattern is that
at first, the Board

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:54.340 align:middle line:10%
offers advice that may be
interesting, or helpful.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'll find a
lost pair of car keys,

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.210 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the
messages start to get

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.590 align:middle line:84%
coarse and degraded
and threatening--

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As the person is
opening up without discretion.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Without
discretion, yes.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And people have
horrifying experiences

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.291 align:middle line:90%
and I sympathize with that.

00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And some of those same people
come to me and they say,

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.267 align:middle line:84%
well, look, why are
you talking about this?

00:43:16.267 --> 00:43:17.350 align:middle line:10%
People shouldn't use this.

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:19.480 align:middle line:84%
People shouldn't
experiment with this.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's a subtle question
because I will never discourage

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.410 align:middle line:90%
nonphysical experiment.

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I am the first to acknowledge
that one should never

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:34.420 align:middle line:84%
approach a Ouija Board lightly
and in a discretionary way.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not a toy.

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:37.840 align:middle line:84%
It may be shrink-wrapped
and have a barcode on it,

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.990 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a toy and it
shouldn't be treated as one.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:42.730 align:middle line:84%
You're getting behind
the wheel of a car

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and you would never get
behind the wheel of a car

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.860 align:middle line:84%
in kind of this blind way,
without being trained,

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.630 align:middle line:84%
without having
the headlights on,

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.047 align:middle line:84%
without having a
learner's permit.

00:43:51.047 --> 00:43:53.046 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there are
some really simple rules

00:43:53.046 --> 00:43:54.400 align:middle line:90%
of engagement, in my opinion.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Please, yeah.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.155 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:56.155 --> 00:43:57.340 align:middle line:90%
It's dog-simple.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.520 align:middle line:84%
When you start hearing
instructive things that,

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.620 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, of a
negative order, when

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:06.190 align:middle line:84%
you start hearing things
that put something above you,

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:09.820 align:middle line:84%
or someone else, anything
that starts smacking

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.450 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of hierarchical
or dark messaging

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and has a feeling of that to
it, you put the Ouija Board away

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.359 align:middle line:90%
and go get some real training.

00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, those
are the same instructions

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I give my own kids
for social media.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.140 align:middle line:84%
How similar is social
media to an Ouija Board?

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.800 align:middle line:84%
We all get excited and worked
up over the Ouija Board.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the same phenomenon
of social media.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.976 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: You're putting
yourself out there.

00:44:32.976 --> 00:44:36.190 align:middle line:84%
You're getting these anonymous
messages from who knows where.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.269 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
they're reassuring,

00:44:38.269 --> 00:44:40.060 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they're
useful, sometimes they're

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.370 align:middle line:84%
very coarse and
violent messages.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So the same rules
of the road apply.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.505 align:middle line:10%
But I cannot close the door on
nonphysical experimentation.

00:44:48.505 --> 00:44:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The fact is, one
of the largest religions today

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.580 align:middle line:90%
in Vietnam is called Caodaism.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.710 align:middle line:10%
It's the largest
religion outside

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.420 align:middle line:10%
of Catholicism and Buddhism.

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:03.340 align:middle line:10%
It began in the 1920s through
the use of a Ouija Board.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.640 align:middle line:10%
And another piece of history
that Americans do not know--

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.840 align:middle line:10%
the Caodaist religion was,
itself, very pro-American,

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.660 align:middle line:10%
because they saw themselves
as having been born out

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.990 align:middle line:10%
of the age of
American spiritualism.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:20.530 align:middle line:10%
They had a private militia
that sided, first with French,

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.440 align:middle line:10%
and later with US forces,
right up until the end

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.750 align:middle line:10%
of the war in 1975.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:10%
That religion, which had
its own private army,

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.750 align:middle line:10%
was one of America's
staunchest allies,

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:33.220 align:middle line:10%
right up until the
end of the war.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.054 align:middle line:10%
And they were founded
through a Ouija board.

00:45:35.054 --> 00:45:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Little known
piece of history,

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.050 align:middle line:90%
that's very interesting.

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:41.202 align:middle line:84%
Now comes the subject of new
thought and Phineas Quimby.

00:45:41.202 --> 00:45:42.002 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:45:42.002 --> 00:45:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've done a couple
interviews with Stephen Ross.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know Stephen Ross,

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:51.240 align:middle line:84%
but Phineas Quimby plays a very
large role in his philosophies

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.040 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So people can go take a
look at that interview

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.266 align:middle line:84%
too, because we're
going to touch on it.

00:45:55.266 --> 00:45:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about Phineas' role.

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.530 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Phineas
Quimby was a clockmaker

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:02.980 align:middle line:10%
who lived in New
Hampshire and Maine.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And he, too, was among
the many Americans

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.820 align:middle line:84%
who was influenced
by experiments

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.440 align:middle line:84%
in mesmerism, hypnotism,
going into trance states.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Quimby, when he lived in
the state of New Hampshire,

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:21.700 align:middle line:84%
was suffering from tuberculosis,
which was very often a death

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.810 align:middle line:90%
sentence in those days.

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:23.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:23.685 --> 00:46:26.260 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: And not only
that, but the supposed cures

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.085 align:middle line:10%
were often worse than
the disease itself,

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:29.710 align:middle line:10%
because there was a
practice in America

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:32.860 align:middle line:10%
at the time called heroic
medicine, which basically

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.132 align:middle line:10%
involved poisoning someone to
the point of expunging disease.

00:46:36.132 --> 00:46:37.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, you mean
like chemotherapy?

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.590 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah,
and in this case,

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:42.910 align:middle line:10%
they would actually inject
people with mercury,

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:46.540 align:middle line:10%
or other toxins, to induce
bodily sweating, to--

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Purge.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.740 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --induce to
purge, to induce salivating.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Physicians, barely
worthy of the word,

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.530 align:middle line:84%
would even cause open
wounds, weeping wounds,

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:57.637 align:middle line:90%
would use leeches.

00:46:57.637 --> 00:46:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this was medical--

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.386 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To get rid
of the evil humors.

00:47:00.386 --> 00:47:03.790 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, and this
was medieval medicine being

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:07.450 align:middle line:10%
used in pre-Civil War America.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:10.490 align:middle line:10%
So Quimby was suffering
not only from tuberculosis,

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:14.770 align:middle line:10%
but from the horrible effects
of so-called heroic medicine.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:18.690 align:middle line:10%
And he took, on a
friend's advice,

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:22.890 align:middle line:10%
this rousing horse and buggy
ride in the New England

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:24.690 align:middle line:10%
countryside one day.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.690 align:middle line:10%
And he found that,
as an aftereffect

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:33.180 align:middle line:10%
of this exciting horseback ride,
the symptoms of tuberculosis

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.880 align:middle line:10%
receded, and receded
for some time.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.670 align:middle line:90%
There was a lasting aftereffect.

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:39.211 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
he was exhilarated.

00:47:39.211 --> 00:47:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He was
exhilarated and he

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:44.820 align:middle line:84%
began to draw connections
between our mood

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and our physical state,
our physical well-being.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.540 align:middle line:10%
And Quimby basically
came to a theory

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.250 align:middle line:10%
which he summarized this way--

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:55.950 align:middle line:10%
man's happiness
is in his belief.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Man's happiness
is in his belief.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:02.430 align:middle line:84%
That was the opening
note of everything

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:05.820 align:middle line:84%
that we, today, call the
power of positive thinking,

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.874 align:middle line:84%
or The Secret, or the
law of attraction.

00:48:07.874 --> 00:48:09.540 align:middle line:10%
People talk about
these things extending

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:13.350 align:middle line:10%
backwards to hermeticism and so
forth, and they certainly do.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But New England
farmers in the 1830s

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.580 align:middle line:84%
were not reading translations
of "The Hermetica."

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.030 align:middle line:10%
>> HOROWITZ: They
didn't have that.

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:24.210 align:middle line:10%
So another thing that I try to
explain to my academic friends

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:28.380 align:middle line:10%
is the very fact that you can
create a thread of connection

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.200 align:middle line:10%
between contemporary thought,
like New Thought, law

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.630 align:middle line:10%
of attraction and
ancient spirituality,

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:37.080 align:middle line:10%
only tells us that people
across vast stretches of time

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.520 align:middle line:10%
are often thinking
about the same things

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.650 align:middle line:10%
and have the same concerns.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.790 align:middle line:84%
There's no actual family
tree of connection.

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: A New
England household

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.700 align:middle line:84%
in the 1830s, if they
have any book at all,

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.560 align:middle line:84%
will have a copy
of the King James

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Bible and maybe
"Pilgrim's Progress,"

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:53.550 align:middle line:90%
or some other devotional book.

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:56.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't have "The Bhagavad
Gita" or "The Hermetica."

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.530 align:middle line:10%
In fact, a book like
"The Tao Te Ching,"

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.870 align:middle line:10%
for example, the first
English translation

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.330 align:middle line:10%
didn't even appear until 1838.

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:05.550 align:middle line:10%
It's not as if these
things were accessible.

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:08.280 align:middle line:10%
So Quimby, like other
American experimenters,

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:12.900 align:middle line:10%
arrives at this independently
and he promulgates the idea

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.390 align:middle line:10%
that through changing
your thinking,

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:17.830 align:middle line:10%
you could actually
reorganize your health,

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.990 align:middle line:10%
improve your health, reorganize
your entire mental state.

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And he gains some
influential students,

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.870 align:middle line:84%
including a woman named Mary
Glover, who later became

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of
The Christian Science Church,

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:34.321 align:middle line:84%
one of the most influential
of all modern religions.

00:49:34.321 --> 00:49:35.820 align:middle line:10%
And there were many
other people who

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:39.220 align:middle line:10%
passed through Quimby's world,
all of them very interesting,

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.390 align:middle line:10%
many of them very learned.

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:44.220 align:middle line:10%
And in their own way, they
created the modern movements

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:47.770 align:middle line:10%
that, again, we today refer
to as New Thought, power

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:50.280 align:middle line:10%
of positive thinking, law
of attraction, The Secret.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.485 align:middle line:10%
It began that day in 1838 on
Quimby's horse and buggy ride.

00:49:53.485 --> 00:49:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
said this was already

00:49:55.110 --> 00:50:00.680 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of-- it was called
then, "pray and grow rich."

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, the
prosperity angle came in later.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's funny,
it's interesting.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:12.390 align:middle line:10%
In the 1890s, there were
a lot of prayer therapists

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:16.080 align:middle line:10%
in the country who were taking
a leaf from Quimby's book,

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.360 align:middle line:10%
but licensing laws
began also getting

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:19.844 align:middle line:10%
passed against some
of these people

00:50:19.844 --> 00:50:21.510 align:middle line:10%
and they were being
run out of business.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.460 align:middle line:10%
The country was also
going through a period

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:25.740 align:middle line:10%
of enormous growth
and prosperity.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:28.590 align:middle line:10%
The Sears catalog was finding
its way into every home

00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:30.780 align:middle line:10%
and Americans wanted
a piece of the action.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:35.130 align:middle line:10%
And some journalists and mental
healers and experimenters

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.680 align:middle line:10%
in Quimby's philosophy
thought, well, wait a minute.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.320 align:middle line:84%
If this works in terms
of physical wellness,

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.790 align:middle line:84%
couldn't it work in terms of
finance, relationships, career?

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And we
Americans, we take an idea

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.379 align:middle line:84%
and we immediately
say to ourselves, A,

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:50.670 align:middle line:90%
how do I cut out the middleman?

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:52.067 align:middle line:90%
How do I do this myself?

00:50:52.067 --> 00:50:53.150 align:middle line:90%
So we get the Ouija Board.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:57.027 align:middle line:10%
And then B, how do I
expand it beyond the point

00:50:57.027 --> 00:50:58.860 align:middle line:10%
that the person who
originally introduced it

00:50:58.860 --> 00:50:59.790 align:middle line:10%
even conceived of?

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:02.580 align:middle line:10%
So Quimby and mental
healing almost

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:06.660 align:middle line:10%
fall by the wayside to a certain
degree, and by the 1890s,

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:09.269 align:middle line:10%
and so forth, Americans
want to think and grow rich,

00:51:09.269 --> 00:51:11.310 align:middle line:10%
and the movement becomes
the Prosperity Movement,

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:12.090 align:middle line:10%
to a great extent.

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Wallace Wattles, let's
kind of skipped through him

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:14.870 align:middle line:90%
pretty quickly.

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Remarkable man.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.419 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: He wrote, of
course, a famous book in 1910

00:51:18.419 --> 00:51:20.170 align:middle line:10%
called "The Science
of Getting Rich."

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.890 align:middle line:10%
Wattles was somebody who
took all these experiments

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:25.920 align:middle line:10%
in mental healing,
mesmerism, spiritualism,

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.620 align:middle line:10%
and various other
reaches of philosophy,

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:31.410 align:middle line:10%
including idealist philosophy,
and he came to the conclusion

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:33.210 align:middle line:10%
that the mind is a force.

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.690 align:middle line:10%
The mind does have a
causative influencing element,

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:38.940 align:middle line:10%
and that if he
could use the mind

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.180 align:middle line:10%
to dwell on pictures
and emotionalize

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:45.110 align:middle line:10%
thoughts of prosperity,
you could come into it.

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:49.350 align:middle line:10%
And Wattles was another of
these fascinating figures who

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:51.690 align:middle line:10%
kind of brings into
focus the connection

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:55.890 align:middle line:10%
between occult spirituality
and the march of progress.

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:59.460 align:middle line:10%
Wattles was a socialist
and he ran for office

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:03.640 align:middle line:10%
twice on the ticket of Eugene
V. Debs socialist party.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.340 align:middle line:10%
Now I reissued his
book, "The Science

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.980 align:middle line:10%
of Getting Rich," in 2007.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.960 align:middle line:10%
And my reissue
went to number one

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.060 align:middle line:10%
on the "Businessweek"
bestseller list.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.160 align:middle line:10%
And I thought to myself,
the vast majority

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.260 align:middle line:10%
of go-getters who
are reading this book

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:19.980 align:middle line:10%
have no idea that it was written
by an occult socialist who

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:22.860 align:middle line:10%
believed that you could
use the powers of the mind

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:25.530 align:middle line:10%
not only for personal
enrichment and well-being, which

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:28.320 align:middle line:10%
he certainly did believe,
but to create a better

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.310 align:middle line:10%
common environment for everyone.

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And he spells this
out in the book,

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and I sometimes wonder
whether people see that,

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:35.670 align:middle line:90%
or they'd just skip past it.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: But
again, it's all there.

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:41.370 align:middle line:10%
It's all there, it just
requires reorienting our focus

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:44.010 align:middle line:10%
to understand who some
of these people were

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:48.060 align:middle line:10%
and how deep their impact
has been on modern life.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.805 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Then we
go to Ernest Holmes.

00:52:49.805 --> 00:52:51.600 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes,
Ernest Holmes was

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.010 align:middle line:10%
one of the most beloved and
popular figures in the New

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:54.810 align:middle line:10%
Thought tradition.

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:57.150 align:middle line:84%
He founded what is
called "Science of Mind."

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:59.850 align:middle line:84%
He's a figure I hold
in great esteem.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:02.320 align:middle line:84%
He was an influence
on Elvis Presley.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.990 align:middle line:84%
He was an influence all across
Hollywood, on Cecil B. DeMille.

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:09.900 align:middle line:84%
George Lucas has a copy
of "The Science of Mind"

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.100 align:middle line:90%
in his library.

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.260 align:middle line:10%
It was spine-out
on his bookshelf

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:16.050 align:middle line:10%
in a photograph that
was taken of him.

00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Some people speculate that
Ernest's idea of "Science

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:22.770 align:middle line:84%
of Mind" was the basis for
Lucas' concept of the force

00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:24.300 align:middle line:90%
in the Star Wars movie.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.910 align:middle line:84%
But Ernest Holmes was a
very, very lovely man,

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:29.580 align:middle line:90%
popular in the 1930s, 40s, 50s.

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:32.370 align:middle line:10%
He was a direct influence on
Norman Vincent Peale, who,

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:36.060 align:middle line:10%
in 1952, wrote "The Power
of Positive Thinking"

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.940 align:middle line:10%
and interjected the phrase
'positive thinking' into living

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.635 align:middle line:10%
rooms across America.

00:53:40.635 --> 00:53:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then we go--

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:43.470 align:middle line:90%
where else?

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Napoleon Hill.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Napoleon Hill,
also a remarkable figure.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:52.230 align:middle line:10%
He, in 1937, wrote a book called
"Think and Grow Rich," which

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.510 align:middle line:10%
is probably more widely
read today than it

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.220 align:middle line:10%
was during his lifetime.

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.830 align:middle line:10%
And he was an interesting
figure because Hill

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:02.490 align:middle line:10%
had an extraordinary program
for how to use your mind,

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:07.480 align:middle line:10%
but also actions and organized
thinking, to gain prosperity.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.454 align:middle line:84%
He took a leaf from
New Thought, but he

00:54:09.454 --> 00:54:11.370 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to be
identified with New Thought.

00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:14.200 align:middle line:10%
What you'll find in the
bestsellers of the 30s,

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.220 align:middle line:10%
40s, and 50s, is people
using New Thought methods--

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.140 align:middle line:10%
this was true of Dale
Carnegie and "How to Win

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:20.460 align:middle line:10%
Friends and Influence People."

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.680 align:middle line:10%
It was certainly true
of Norman Vincent Peale.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.780 align:middle line:10%
All these people
made New Thought--

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:28.440 align:middle line:10%
they made the idea
of thought causation

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.906 align:middle line:10%
into the bedrock of
American self-help,

00:54:30.906 --> 00:54:32.280 align:middle line:10%
but they didn't
particularly want

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.760 align:middle line:10%
to be associated with any
mystical occult movement.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.610 align:middle line:10%
So the term 'New Thought'
fell by the wayside.

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:41.400 align:middle line:10%
The more popular terms
became "Think and Grow Rich,"

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.930 align:middle line:10%
"The Power of
Positive Thinking,"

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:46.540 align:middle line:10%
phrases that we know today that
are woven into our culture,

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:49.660 align:middle line:10%
but we forget where
they came from.

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Frank B. Robinson--

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and we can spend a
little bit of time here.

00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: My favorite figure.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.226 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What an
interesting character.

00:54:55.226 --> 00:54:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just thinking over
what you wrote in my notes.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.997 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, this is
the fellow-- let's talk

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:02.830 align:middle line:84%
about everything he was
kicked out of first.

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, sure.

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.703 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about what-- and
then we go back into his life.

00:55:05.703 --> 00:55:06.970 align:middle line:90%
But he set a record.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Frank B. Robinson
is one of my favorite figures

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.920 align:middle line:90%
in American spirituality.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.600 align:middle line:10%
And anybody who
wants to be inspired,

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:10%
anybody who feels that they're
at a dead end in their lives,

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.310 align:middle line:10%
should read the story
of Frank B. Robinson.

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole chapter dedicated
to him in "Occult America,"

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.899 align:middle line:84%
it's called "The
Mail-Order Prophet."

00:55:22.899 --> 00:55:23.940 align:middle line:90%
That's how he was known--

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.300 align:middle line:90%
"The Mail-Order Prophet."

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Frank Robinson was a kid who
grew up more or less homeless

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:31.044 align:middle line:10%
in Canada--

00:55:31.044 --> 00:55:32.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Violent
situation in his home.

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Violent
situation-- he grew up

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.880 align:middle line:84%
in the turn of the
century in Canada

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.540 align:middle line:84%
to a Baptist minister who
really didn't want Frank

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:44.794 align:middle line:84%
or his brother around, sent
them penniless to America

00:55:44.794 --> 00:55:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to live with a relative who
had never heard of them,

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.070 align:middle line:84%
never even heard of
this arrangement.

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With $5
in his pocket--

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: $5.

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --for he
and his brother.

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Two young boys--
two young boys, barely

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:55.150 align:middle line:90%
had entered adolescence.

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a more brutal time.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.670 align:middle line:90%
It was a different time.

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could just pack a
kid off onto a freight train,

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.680 align:middle line:84%
or on a steamer,
and say, goodbye.

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.930 align:middle line:10%
You're going to live with
your relatives in Wisconsin.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.304 align:middle line:84%
And if you got there and they
didn't want to take you in,

00:56:07.304 --> 00:56:08.740 align:middle line:90%
you had nowhere to turn.

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So Frank-- Frank
had nowhere to turn.

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Frank had nowhere to turn.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And as a teenager, he bopped
around to different jobs

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.750 align:middle line:90%
in the American West.

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.850 align:middle line:84%
As you were referencing,
he got kicked out

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:21.700 align:middle line:84%
of all these different
branches of the military.

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The British Navy, the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police,

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.555 align:middle line:90%
the US Navy, and Army.

00:56:26.555 --> 00:56:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: And army.

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --for drunkenness
and bad behavior.

00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Right,
I think he actually

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.290 align:middle line:84%
may have set a modern
record for a guy who

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:35.790 align:middle line:84%
had been kicked out the most
Western military organizations.

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:37.540 align:middle line:84%
They took him and then
they'd kick him out

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.560 align:middle line:90%
for binge-drinking, basically.

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.760 align:middle line:10%
And so Frank eventually
pulled his life together

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:44.860 align:middle line:10%
and was living in the
Pacific Northwest,

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:47.650 align:middle line:10%
working as a druggist
in the 1920s.

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:52.090 align:middle line:10%
And he began to get wind of some
of these metaphysical religious

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:54.640 align:middle line:10%
ideas, the basic
premise of which

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.680 align:middle line:10%
is thoughts are causative.

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.336 align:middle line:10%
Thoughts are causative.

00:56:58.336 --> 00:56:59.960 align:middle line:10%
Frank was very
interested in this idea,

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.260 align:middle line:10%
but he was deeply
depressed and he felt

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.450 align:middle line:10%
that his life had gone nowhere.

00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:06.700 align:middle line:10%
He had straightened
his life out.

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.840 align:middle line:90%
He was married.

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:10.510 align:middle line:90%
He had a relatively stable home.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:12.260 align:middle line:90%
He had a job as a druggist.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.050 align:middle line:84%
You would think, well,
he should be happy.

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.470 align:middle line:84%
But like many of us, in
the midst of stability,

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:20.470 align:middle line:84%
he felt this gnawing
emptiness within him,

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:23.380 align:middle line:84%
something was missing
from his life.

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually living
in Los Angeles at the time,

00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and he went to a very
uninspiring church service

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.850 align:middle line:90%
in LA.

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And he came back home
and he closed himself up

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:37.900 align:middle line:84%
in his bedroom, and he
said, my spiritual search

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.160 align:middle line:90%
has been a failure.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:42.310 align:middle line:84%
My life is stable, but
it's going nowhere.

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm just
winding down the clock

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:46.790 align:middle line:90%
until the day of my death.

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:48.820 align:middle line:10%
And he challenged God.

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.920 align:middle line:10%
He got on his
knees, and like one

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.340 align:middle line:10%
of the old biblical prophets,
he challenged God and said,

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:58.760 align:middle line:10%
God, if you're real, if you
truly exist, reveal yourself.

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Show yourself to me.

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, suddenly,
he felt this coursing

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:06.760 align:middle line:84%
energy just passing
through his entire body.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.040 align:middle line:90%
He felt vibrantly alive.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.870 align:middle line:90%
He felt enthusiastic.

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:13.710 align:middle line:84%
He felt uplifted to a
new plane of existence.

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:15.340 align:middle line:10%
And he came to
the conclusion, as

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:20.200 align:middle line:10%
many American metaphysical
thinkers independently have,

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.080 align:middle line:10%
that your mind is God.

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:27.580 align:middle line:10%
That your mind is the God of
scripture, the great creator,

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:31.330 align:middle line:10%
the one whose word spoke
the universe into being,

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:35.470 align:middle line:10%
and that if you can learn to
properly channel the focus

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:38.260 align:middle line:10%
and energies of your
mind, you can actually

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.900 align:middle line:10%
forge a different
reality for yourself.

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So Frank, through personal
testing and experiment,

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:46.090 align:middle line:90%
came to feel that this was true.

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:48.760 align:middle line:10%
And again, in a great
American tradition,

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.520 align:middle line:10%
he decided that he had to
bring this to the masses,

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.650 align:middle line:10%
and his way of doing it
would be through a series

00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:55.330 align:middle line:10%
of correspondence courses.

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But not only courses, he would
found a new religion, something

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:00.850 align:middle line:90%
we're very good at in America.

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And he called it
Psychiana, Psychiana.

00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:07.600 align:middle line:10%
And the idea was this is the
new psychological religion.

00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.840 align:middle line:10%
This teaches you that the
transcendent is actually

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.450 align:middle line:10%
in here, that your
brain is a receptor

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.870 align:middle line:10%
of transcendent energies, that
you can pass out into the world

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:18.910 align:middle line:10%
to improve your
situation, improve

00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:20.290 align:middle line:10%
the situation of others.

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.770 align:middle line:84%
He scraped together
$500, began to take out

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:27.400 align:middle line:84%
advertisements on the back
of matchbooks and magazines.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.940 align:middle line:10%
He sat down one day at a
typewriter for about 24 hours

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:33.490 align:middle line:10%
straight-- a
borrowed typewriter.

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:37.150 align:middle line:10%
And he typed out the first
20 lessons, correspondence

00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:40.800 align:middle line:10%
lessons, of his new
psychological religion

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.610 align:middle line:10%
of Psychiana.

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:42.650 align:middle line:90%
It became a sensation.

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:44.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of the first
many-back religion.

00:59:44.875 --> 00:59:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, he
proudly told reporters,

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I am the only money-back
religion on Earth.

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:53.600 align:middle line:10%
And traditional
religionists hated him

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.330 align:middle line:10%
because they thought,
this fraud, this huckster.

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And he would challenge
them back and say, you

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.590 align:middle line:84%
call me what you
want, but is there

01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:02.960 align:middle line:84%
any other religion
that backs its claims

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.150 align:middle line:90%
with a money-back guarantee?

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.787 align:middle line:10%
He was so audacious
and he was so American.

01:00:07.787 --> 01:00:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And during the Great
Depression, he probably

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.924 align:middle line:90%
had about 2 million followers.

01:00:10.924 --> 01:00:12.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's just amazing.

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:14.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Hugely
popular, hugely popular--

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:15.760 align:middle line:10%
you can find his lessons online.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.480 align:middle line:90%
They stand up rather well.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.250 align:middle line:84%
He was really in New
Thought tradition--

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's still
called-- under Psychiana?

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.138 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Still
called Psychiana.

01:00:21.138 --> 01:00:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Now Frank died in 1948.

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:25.040 align:middle line:10%
He died of heart failure.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.410 align:middle line:10%
And he didn't really
leave any heirs.

01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:31.190 align:middle line:10%
He didn't really leave anyone
to tend to the flock after him.

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:35.000 align:middle line:10%
He did have a son named Alfred,
who graduated from the US--

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.840 align:middle line:10%
who was actually
in the Air Force.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.930 align:middle line:10%
Alfred came out of
the Air Force and he

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:42.230 align:middle line:10%
was going to resume
his father's religion,

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:44.050 align:middle line:10%
but his heart
wasn't really in it.

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And I had one
exchange of letters

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
with Alfred, where I asked
if I could talk to him

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.503 align:middle line:90%
and get together with him.

01:00:48.503 --> 01:00:50.200 align:middle line:84%
He sent me a very,
very nice letter,

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.241 align:middle line:84%
and he said he would like
to, but his health just

01:00:52.241 --> 01:00:53.670 align:middle line:90%
didn't permit it.

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:55.780 align:middle line:90%
But Frank was forgotten.

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:59.060 align:middle line:84%
If you mentioned Frank
Robinson's name in the 1930s,

01:00:59.060 --> 01:00:59.930 align:middle line:90%
people heard of him.

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:02.330 align:middle line:90%
People who knew who he was.

01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But when he died, he left
no way for his religion

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:08.060 align:middle line:90%
to perpetuate itself.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even Benito
Mussolini had come in contact

01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:11.110 align:middle line:90%
with his work.

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:14.540 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Very strange-- yeah,
Frank would send his books out

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.340 align:middle line:10%
to people.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.580 align:middle line:10%
And he got some letter of
acknowledgment from Mussolini.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:23.960 align:middle line:10%
Frank also wrote to the
president of Finland.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.350 align:middle line:10%
During World War II, Finland
was beset by an axis invasion

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:30.650 align:middle line:10%
and he announced to
the Finnish president

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:33.410 align:middle line:10%
that he had a mantra
that he was going

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:36.560 align:middle line:10%
to say every day for the
safety of the Finnish people,

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.660 align:middle line:10%
and that he thought that
the president, and that

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.240 align:middle line:10%
his cabinet, and the parliament,
should say this every day.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.448 align:middle line:10%
And the Finnish president
actually wrote back to him,

01:01:43.448 --> 01:01:46.280 align:middle line:10%
and I swear he had his
tongue-in and he said, thank you

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.260 align:middle line:10%
very much for your suggestion.

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:51.020 align:middle line:84%
We will begin to undertake
this program of yours

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.595 align:middle line:90%
as soon as it is practicable.

01:01:52.595 --> 01:01:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: So I
thought there was

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.100 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of humor in that.

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.849 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with
Mussolini, as I recall,

01:01:56.849 --> 01:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
he actually wrote
to him and said,

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.550 align:middle line:84%
essentially, he was trying to
stop the efforts of Hitler.

01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:02.634 align:middle line:90%
He called upon his flock--

01:02:02.634 --> 01:02:03.841 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, yes, he did.

01:02:03.841 --> 01:02:06.133 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to use mental
imagery to stop Hitler from--

01:02:06.133 --> 01:02:07.174 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: That's right.

01:02:07.174 --> 01:02:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Frank would pass around these
buttons to people that said,

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I am affirming the
power of right,

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:14.750 align:middle line:84%
or God, to overcome Hitler
and the axis powers hourly.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:17.410 align:middle line:84%
He asked his followers to
do that by the hour, yeah.

>>REGINA: Yeah.

We're out of time and we have
so much more to cover, here.

01:02:21.697 --> 01:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do
is because we didn't get

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.140 align:middle line:84%
to everything in
this conversation,

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to would push it
to the next conversation,

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.310 align:middle line:90%
and pick it up there, OK?

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Sounds great.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.213 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, it's been a blast.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:32.245 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Likewise.

01:02:32.245 --> 01:02:34.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: As Mitch and I
continue our conversation,

01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:37.250 align:middle line:10%
we'll come upon the lives
of Manly P. Hall and Edgar

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:38.922 align:middle line:10%
Cayce in the next talk.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.880 align:middle line:84%
