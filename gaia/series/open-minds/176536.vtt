00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Jerry
Wills is back with us again.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:10%
This time we're going
back to his roots

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.280 align:middle line:10%
in healing and looking
at some of the illnesses

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:10%
that are becoming epidemic, as
well as how we can powerfully

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:10%
engage with our own
healing processes,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.259 align:middle line:10%
rather than waiting
for a healer, like him,

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:10%
to do it for us.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:10%
And on that note,
as I just say that,

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:10%
I know I've been a bit of a
whiner the last few hours,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:10%
but you just performed the
most wonderful healing on me

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:10%
because I'd burned one, two,
three, four bandages there.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I burned the heck
out of four fingers

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:90%
this morning, all blistering up.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
really excruciating.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And Suzanne, our lovely
makeup artist and friend,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle line:84%
texted you and said, Jerry,
when you get to the studio,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.720 align:middle line:90%
do some ju-ju.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And last show I did I
had my fingers stuck

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:84%
in a bucket of ice the whole
show because it hurt so much.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.520 align:middle line:90%
But you did something.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:90%
And you were blowing on it.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.411 align:middle line:84%
And you were doing
some other things.

00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And the pain's virtually gone.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:10%
>>JERRY WILLS: I figure it'll
be gone within the next 30

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:10%
minutes.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:10%
It usually takes about
an hour for something

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:10%
that serious to really
have a turn around.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Usually when I work with
someone, I try to set things up

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:84%
so the body moves more
slowly so it isn't taxed.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of when I've
worked with someone that

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
has something seriously
that's going on,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.220 align:middle line:90%
I try to fix things immediately.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, when
I do it that way,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:84%
it can sometimes cause
a little bit more pain

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.409 align:middle line:90%
before it feels better.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.208 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
My eyes were forming
tears when you

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.560 align:middle line:84%
were working on it, because
I burned it three times.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Not once, but three
times in a row,

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.340 align:middle line:84%
which I don't even want
to get into the stupidity

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:90%
that allowed that to happen.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:90%
So it was really burnt.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The skin was now
feeling like paper.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And so oh, I'm going
to lose all the skin

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:90%
on my thumb and three fingers.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
But what you did to
bring the energy up

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:90%
caused immense pain initially.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I had to bring a great
deal of blood into the area,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:90%
really saturate it.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you were
breathing pretty deeply

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that anyway.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So a lot
more oxygen was there.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But I was bringing all
the resources of your body

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to bear to bring
it up to that point

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:84%
so that even though
it was hurting,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
there were immense changes
that were being initiated.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Within 10 minutes the
pain started subsiding.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And I figure within
an hour, which

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.766 align:middle line:84%
now is about a half hour from
now, before the show's over,

00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%
it should feel pretty good.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I just
wanted to say thank you.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.526 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the first time.

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I remember one time you
came into the studio.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking at
lunch with some people.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I laughed,
or coughed, or something,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
but it burst the blood
vessels in my eye.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing
was blood red.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And you came in
and did your ju-ju.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:90%
And I woke up.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:90%
And by morning it was gone.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you just
always come right

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:90%
at the right time for me.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Not only to deliver
your beautiful messages

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of us.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: When someone's in
pain, it really hurts my heart.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I know you have a very
sweet, tender heart.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I just don't like
it when someone's in pain.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:90%
It really bothers me.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I can feel it.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
When I finished
working with your hand,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%
it was burning the
inside of my hand.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I could feel what
you were feeling.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And, of course,
I can get rid of it.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's just a
mirror image of energy.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But you getting rid of it
was much more difficult.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.346 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:39.346 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to talk
to you about that.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's where our
conversation really begins

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:90%
is when you encounter someone.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Something's happened.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Especially if it's
acute like that.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.740 align:middle line:90%
But even if it's chronic.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I know healers operate
in different ways

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and have different ways of
accessing the information.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's go on the inside
of Jerry's head, and inside

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:84%
of your feeling and
the senses in general,

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and tell us what
it looks like when

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
you start entering in
to someone else's body

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:90%
to see what's going on.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I know even with my
burnt fingers, you went, oh.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:84%
You jumped back
and like something

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:90%
when you connected in.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.654 align:middle line:84%
So tell what it looks
like from your viewpoint.

00:04:19.654 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, the first
thing that happens--

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:84%
let's just use you
as the example first,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.780 align:middle line:90%
because that's most recent.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And you'll understand
this more comprehensively.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Let me see your hand.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:84%
When I first got
close, like this--

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and you can probably
feel my energy

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:90%
coming towards your right now.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I was receiving.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't sending.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Because I wanted to know.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to get all the images.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to feel what
you were feeling.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's what made me jump.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
It was just something
I couldn't control.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It just kind
of shocks the system.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, after I
had that as an idea,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
the next thing
that I wanted to do

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
was to start pulling
all of this energy,

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:90%
because it was all dispersed.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to pull
it into a focus.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain
that in a moment.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But when I had it
into a focus, then I

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:84%
could start reconstructing
the patterns of the energy

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
around your hand
and your fingers

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
more specifically so that it was
more like it's supposed to be.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like jump starting
a car, perhaps.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Once I had that in place,
then I sent energy down

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
through your arm
and into your body

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and started pulling from your
entire body up to this point.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you started
feeling all that pain.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But I was pulling nonspecific
cells, all kinds of material

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
to bring it up here,
minerals, enzymes.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:84%
How did you know
what to bring up?

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So how does that
show itself to you

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:84%
so that you know what to
call upon and draw forth,

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:84%
before we get into this
whole notion of focus?

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the way that it
occurs to me is because--

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I really don't know
how to answer that.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I have a sheet
of paper with details on it.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like I have
any medical background.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
But I just intuitively
know things,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:90%
which is hard to explain.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:90%
But I also see things.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And these things
that I see when I look at you,

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:84%
or look at your hand,
or look at any person,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.220 align:middle line:90%
I can just see the person.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But if I drop into another
frame of reference,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
then I can see the
field around you.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And every person that
I've ever encountered

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:84%
has a beautiful field,
a beautiful soul inside.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:84%
When I see the field
around the person,

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
things that are or are not

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.940 align:middle line:84%
correct from what my
experience has taught me.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically that
it's coherent, that it flows,

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
that it moves, and that there
aren't any gaps, that there

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.144 align:middle line:90%
are smooth features.

00:07:05.144 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, for your
hand, that wasn't the case.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It was diffuse, as
though someone had--

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Incoherent.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Incoherent.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So because of that, that's
where it came into the focus,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:90%
to reconstruct that field.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Once I have that
in hand, to where

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I can see that that's
occurred, the next step

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
is to go down inside
the person's body.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.891 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And when I go
inside of a person's body,

00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and I do this every day with
my clients all over the world,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:90%
then I see things.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's
say that a person

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:90%
had an issue with their liver.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:84%
When I take a look
at the outside first,

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:90%
then I see there's an issue.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, well,
I have this liver issue,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might be.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's hepatitis, or a fatty
liver, but some liver issue.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Then I can see it in the field
before I ever get inside.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Then I go inside, because
I try to change it

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
on the outside
first to see what's

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:90%
going to happen if I change it.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's enough.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that
changes it, and I know

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.050 align:middle line:84%
things are going to move
in the right direction.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But if it doesn't
really change the way

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that I think it should change
as fast as it should change,

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.430 align:middle line:84%
or if I change it
and it changes back,

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.290 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't want to stay
there, these are things I see.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:90%
So then I go inside.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And I take a walk
around the liver.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Size is not something that
is a consideration here.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Instead it's like
my consciousness

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:90%
goes into this area.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like a little
bot, a little nanobot?

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:44.859 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Exactly.

00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And it can be as big as this
room or as small as a pea.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's no benefit
in small as a pea.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So I get myself seemingly
small so I can go and look.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You downsize,
as the recent movie.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.790 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLS: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:10%
And I go looking.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:10%
And the smaller I become,
the larger, in this case,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:10%
the liver becomes.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I can see the patterns
on the shape of the liver.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And I can see the
fields moving through.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's one there
that isn't quite right.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So I get smaller still
and go into that area

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:84%
until I get to the
point where I'm

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:84%
at the size I need to be
to see what the problem is.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:90%
That's how it is for me.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm seeing, I didn't
realize I was seeing exactly

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:90%
the way that things look.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.556 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
you find that out?

00:09:40.556 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, there was
a fellow that I worked on.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:90%
He was a doctor.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And in this case he
had a liver issue.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:84%
He was terribly sick,
not expected to live.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And his friend had brought
me there to see him.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.450 align:middle line:90%
This is in northern California.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.889 align:middle line:90%
I went and took a look.

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
the liver looks like.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I've never really
studied anatomy.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So I went down, doing the
same process I just described.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
all these details.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So the fellow is
a doctor as well.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying,
what do you see?

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.444 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:10:18.444 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I see the liver,

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:84%
but I see these round
areas that kind of have

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:84%
a greenish tint to them with
kind of another round area

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a little paler.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:90%
And there's wrinkles here.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:90%
And I could see my own liver.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.460 align:middle line:90%
It didn't look like that.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
describing it to him.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, that's
exactly what it looks like.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I've done autopsies
on a lot of cadavers.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:90%
I've seen this before.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what this
disease does to the liver.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.489 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It must
have freaked him out.

00:10:50.489 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: He was pretty shocked.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.024 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I was like,
well, how about that.

00:10:56.024 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Because I didn't know.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, this is over
the course of over 20 years

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:90%
ago that this happened.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And since that time I've
tried to make it a point

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:90%
to get to know more about this.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Some people are very squeamish.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:84%
They probably could
never do an autopsy.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: If I had an
opportunity, I would.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to look inside
to really see for myself

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.030 align:middle line:84%
what's there, versus
what I'm seeing.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think in most
cases, when I've

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:84%
spoken to clinical
researchers and doctors,

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
surgeons, at least those
who have done the autopsies

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and know what they're
talking about,

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:46.460 align:middle line:84%
what I'm seeing goes far
beyond what they've ever seen.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I can just
keep getting smaller.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I can get down to the
red blood cell size

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:90%
and walk into a red blood cell.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I get down to
the red blood cell size,

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I can go into the red
blood cell to take a look

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:90%
and see whatever is there.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are some
folks of some races

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:90%
who have sickle cell anemia.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone in and
taken a look at that.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's surprising
what it looks like.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:17.196 align:middle line:84%
It kind of looks like a weird
shape of a red blood cell.

00:12:17.196 --> 00:12:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean like
a sickle shaped cell?

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.163 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen
that under a microscope.

00:12:22.163 --> 00:12:24.440 align:middle line:90%
But I'd love to.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.171 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, beyond
going even that small,

00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:84%
the smallest I've ever gone
was down to see what genes

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:90%
look like, and to observe that.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I've done that a
couple of times.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
There comes a
point when I get so

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.980 align:middle line:84%
small that it's as though I'm
entering another universe.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Cause it's not material anymore.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I know.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It's just points of light
in a vast empty space.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Which is all we are
composed of anyway.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, I know.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But still,
to go into that,

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
where is your
point of reference.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:90%
There's no point of reference.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.259 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And what would happen
if I continued getting small?

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Would I end up in a
world where there's

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:90%
another world with people?

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I've asked myself
this question, and it

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
does sound kind of strange
and perhaps far fetched.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:84%
But as a matter of curiosity,
I just wonder about this.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's astonishing to be
able to see things like this.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there
have been novels

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and search based on
almost such things, right?

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh yeah.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:90%
"Fantastic Voyage."

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.253 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Where you discover
yet another universe.

00:13:36.253 --> 00:13:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you just look
at the notion of fractals,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
the fractal universe, for
example, and fractal form,

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.740 align:middle line:90%
it's that.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It keeps drilling
down into itself,

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:90%
replicated again and again.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So now, when you get
into an area that

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:84%
is even smaller than DNA, where
there is no point of reference,

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.230 align:middle line:84%
now you're getting
into consciousness.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And, again,
consciousness is what

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.440 align:middle line:84%
superimposes itself
and creates the effects

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
that we start seeing
from the genetic level

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:90%
all the way back up.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And even I had a weird
experience this morning.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Not weird.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I actually had time to meditate
before I came into work.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Had a lovely
meditation, just kind

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.420 align:middle line:84%
of going through a lot
of constituents of life.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
my being or my guide

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
said was still the one
thing you have not mastered

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and you have not learned is
how to care for yourself,

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:84%
in that I don't take
time for massages,

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:84%
or really anything to
take care of myself.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:38.232 align:middle line:84%
It's like everybody else's need
or desire kind of comes first.

00:14:38.232 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
in any sacrificial way.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:84%
It's that I don't
have any boundaries.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.215 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK, well, I
need to learn to do that.

00:14:44.215 --> 00:14:45.014 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:14:45.014 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:84%
A few minutes later I burned
the heck out of my fingers

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:90%
three times.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And now all these people are
so lovely, and helping me,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:84%
including you, in this
whole notion of care

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't take the
time to do it for myself.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, that didn't
go unnoticed, because now I

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.201 align:middle line:90%
have to pay for it for a while.

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But in each of these
things, right down

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:84%
to cirrhosis of the
liver, or whatnot,

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:84%
there's a consciousness
that's pervading that too.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
intertwine with or start

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.782 align:middle line:84%
reading into the consciousness
then that created the problem?

00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I don't know
about what created the problem,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
because I think there is another
force at work there within us

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:84%
that guides and directs
us in an unseen way.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And quite often it
approaches our consciousness,

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:90%
and we question it.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:90%
We don't really trust it.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:90%
And you'd think that I would.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But this afternoon I went to one
of the cannabis dispensaries.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was holding in my
hand a bottle of CBD oil.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.096 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I'm thinking
to myself, because I

00:15:50.096 --> 00:15:52.680 align:middle line:90%
felt so compelled to do it.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, why do
I feel like I need this?

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't need this.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And it just kept
washing over me.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, it
must be the altitude.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I got way too cold,
cause it's real cold here,

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.490 align:middle line:90%
It's very cold right now.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So I handed
it back to the guy.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'll think
about this and come back.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.575 align:middle line:84%
And then I find out from Susan
that you've hurt your fingers.

00:16:22.575 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
already on your way here.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I was.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't go back and get it.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just was kicking
myself, why didn't I do this?

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I have
found over and over again

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
when I've gone small
and come back out again

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
is that no matter
how small I've ever

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
gone, how deep I've
ever gone into this,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
the vast expanse
of consciousness

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and the presence of
incredible awareness,

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.520 align:middle line:84%
because those are
two separate things--

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain the
difference in a moment.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.589 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: No matter
how small I've gotten,

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:84%
it's just as powerful there
as it is where I sit today.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And the difference between
consciousness and awareness

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness is like
the light that hits the wall.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:90%
And you're conscious.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.369 align:middle line:90%
It's a light hitting the wall.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Awareness is looking at
the wall and understanding

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:90%
what you're seeing.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The more aware you are, the
more aware you can become.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And awareness is what gives you
back the feedback that allows

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.070 align:middle line:90%
you to ask the question, why.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Like why did I not
pick up the CBD

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:84%
oil when a few minutes
later I was going

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:90%
to get a text that someone--

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:84%
in this case me-
really needed it.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
intuitively picked up

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:84%
would be the best thing to
use for the next several days,

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, til skin starts
removing itself or whatnot.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, well,
the way I did this,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.540 align:middle line:90%
the skin is going to be fine.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My god.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:84%
It sure looks ugly now,
all gray and bloated.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Many years
ago I was in Mexico.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it would be fun
to light off a handful of bottle

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.304 align:middle line:90%
rockets with my cigarette.

00:18:10.304 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
sounds like a swell

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.042 align:middle line:84%
time, an accident waiting
to happen in other words.

00:18:15.042 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I
had my kids there.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.458 align:middle line:90%
And we were on a beach.

00:18:17.458 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the
middle of nowhere.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.795 align:middle line:84%
You know how we go in
the middle of nowhere.

00:18:20.795 --> 00:18:21.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yup.

00:18:21.595 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: So I lit it off.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:90%
And they all went off.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, jeez.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I had
second and third degree

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:90%
burns over my whole hand.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.972 align:middle line:90%
It was just burned up.

00:18:32.972 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:90%
I was going into shock.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ow.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:90%
Ow.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It was just terrible.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, usually with
third degree burns,

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:90%
you don't end up scarless.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.492 align:middle line:84%
You end up with
some evidence of it.

00:18:44.492 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:90%
And I did what you did.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I went and found some ice,
stuck my hand in the ice.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going into shock.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I remembered
that what I needed to do

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:84%
was to focus energy
there and just heal it,

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:90%
which is what I did with you.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Instantly the pain was gone.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And within two weeks,
all the skin just

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.390 align:middle line:84%
dried up, flaked off
like a bad sunburn,

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.391 align:middle line:90%
and there were no scars.

00:19:09.391 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:90%
There aren't.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So the
process of awareness

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
is far beyond the boundaries
of just consciousness.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness isn't
that big of a deal.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:84%
People want to get
higher consciousness.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:90%
What is higher consciousness?

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:90%
It's just a brighter light.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But awareness is actually
when you can take a look

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and see the intrinsic
details and understand

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:90%
what you're seeing.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what the
difference is between the two.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
were using obviously

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.225 align:middle line:84%
a combination of both when
you go inside someone's body.

00:19:48.225 --> 00:19:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Consciousness
is the light.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.895 align:middle line:90%
That exposes the issue.

00:19:51.895 --> 00:19:52.695 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:19:52.695 --> 00:19:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Awareness can suss out
what it is and then what to do.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does their
consciousness and the issues

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:84%
that may have led to something
start feeding in at all?

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Or do you start at the
cellular or DNA level

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.714 align:middle line:84%
when you start the
healing process?

00:20:09.714 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I've had people
who thought that what I did

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:90%
was a lot of hooey.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Didn't want it.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
But they were coerced into it by
a family member or a loved one.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Their consciousness
and their awareness

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.441 align:middle line:84%
had no bearing on
this whatsoever.

00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what they believe.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:90%
What matters is what I believe.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.240 align:middle line:90%
They will change their mind.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:90%
They always do when it works.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what to think.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:90%
So no.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Their level, where their
at, it doesn't really

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.252 align:middle line:84%
have a significant
impact on what I do.

00:20:45.252 --> 00:20:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what about
their unconscious patterns

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that created the
underlying problem?

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
They created the problem
with the liver, for example.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Or my underlying issue
of not taking the time

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.572 align:middle line:84%
to just care for myself
and take time to myself?

00:20:58.572 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, maybe this
was a wake up call for you.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.071 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, I think it was.

00:21:02.071 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And that's
why I say that there

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.570 align:middle line:90%
is that small presence.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not so small, but
we'll call it a small voice,

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:84%
metaphorically so
it's understandable,

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:84%
a small voice that
prompts us that pushes us,

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that directs us in ways that
aren't overt, or even sometimes

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:90%
obvious.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:90%
But it still helps us to grow.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And whether that's coming
from some god like being

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
or it's just the greater
part of ourselves trying

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:84%
to express through our
actions and our motivations

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.522 align:middle line:84%
what it is that we're lacking
that we need for ourselves.

00:21:45.522 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you able to
reflect that back to people

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
after you've dealt
with them sometimes?

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Do you have permission?

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Or do you feel inclined to share
back with them, this is maybe

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:90%
part of how you ended up here?

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sometimes.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.522 align:middle line:84%
It depends if they're
willing to listen.

00:22:02.522 --> 00:22:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Cause there's a lot of things
that happen during a healing.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: This is
just one part of it.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I've also worked on people, and
had their loved ones show up

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:90%
who have passed away.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And they'll stand by
them and tell me things,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and wanted me to tell them
things they needed to know.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:28.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot in this territory
that if I'm aware, then

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I can help them to
become more aware.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these messages
are very significant for them.

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Other times I see things and
I try to give them guidance.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's accepted.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, most people
want to have the magic bullet.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm hurt.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:90%
Fix me.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.390 align:middle line:90%
I need to go.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wanted the
magic bullet today.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, and
it's understandable.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.570 align:middle line:90%
And you really needed it.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.236 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have three
interviews ahead.

00:22:57.236 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: When Kathy dropped
that coffee cup on her toe

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and broke the big toe bone,
she wanted a magic bullet too.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I knew it was going
to hurt when I fixed the bone.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I had to scoop her up
in my arms and carry her

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
into the living room, and
just go right to work on that.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.626 align:middle line:84%
And within an hour the bone
was healed and she was fine.

00:23:19.626 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've done
this to yourself as well.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh yeah.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.850 align:middle line:90%
I did it to myself.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.954 align:middle line:90%
I know what to expect.

00:23:27.954 --> 00:23:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where bones can
knit together miraculously

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:90%
in very short periods of time.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.333 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, yeah.

00:23:32.333 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's all just energy.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And time doesn't
exist in that realm of healing.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No, it doesn't.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:43.440 align:middle line:84%
When I'm working on
someone, my typical pattern

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:50.760 align:middle line:84%
is to do the work that I
do and posture their body

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:90%
so that I'll do this much.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's not go into percentages.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:90%
But let's say I'll do this much.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And now it's postured so your
body can do that much as well.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:90%
And then you'll heal.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
take a few days.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:84%
In some instances, depends
on their condition,

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:90%
it might take a week.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.850 align:middle line:90%
But usually it's a few days.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But in a case where you're
hurt, like you, or like Kathy,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:84%
or like the little girl in
the jungle with a broken

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:84%
arm in the middle of nowhere,
I have to fix it immediately.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's talk
about when you don't.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:84%
There is something about
our vesting ourselves

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:84%
in our own well-being
that does matter.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:90%
And talk about that part of it.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, that's very true.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.440 align:middle line:84%
When you are going to
take an active role

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:84%
in your own well-being,
that's a good sign.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Because in my way
of thinking, that

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.150 align:middle line:90%
means you care about yourself.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:90%
I've worked with a lot of folks.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And what I found happening
with a lot of folks--

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking
at the beginning

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:84%
when you were introducing
this about things

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.042 align:middle line:84%
that I see that are going
on that are rampant.

00:25:03.042 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I see some of the
same things over,

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.999 align:middle line:84%
and over, and over
again with people

00:25:05.999 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:90%
that are my age and older.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And I give them the details
of what they need to do.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times
from person to person

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.480 align:middle line:84%
it'll be the same information,
because the same thing applies

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:90%
to so many people.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Some people will take that
and do something about it.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And others will listen
to it and go, well,

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.704 align:middle line:90%
that's what you told my friend.

00:25:30.704 --> 00:25:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Because your friend had
the same thing going on.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.780 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't know it.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:84%
When you get information
that can change your life

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and you do nothing about
it, well, that's fine.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:45.980 align:middle line:90%
It's your life.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.210 align:middle line:84%
You can do something,
or you can do nothing.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But I found, by and
large, that most people

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.430 align:middle line:84%
are curious to know
why something happened

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and what they can do to make a
difference so they don't need

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.570 align:middle line:90%
me.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I do try to teach
people how to do what

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.190 align:middle line:90%
I do so they don't need me.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be needed.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I want to help when I can
help, like in your case.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:84%
When it comes down
to the final mix,

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:19.152 align:middle line:84%
some people actually
do take the incentive

00:26:19.152 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:84%
to do something to
help themselves.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And all they were
missing was knowledge.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I get things set
up to a point where

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:84%
if they do this next
thing for themselves,

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.530 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be fine.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And when it doesn't work out for
them, that they don't do this,

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're not fine,
I've done the best I can.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about our
own underlying belief systems

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
where you've set them up, and
they're obsessed with health,

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.270 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.775 align:middle line:90%
They're going to do everything.

00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:84%
One thing I've
found about people

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:55.500 align:middle line:84%
who are obsessed with health is
that they're operating always

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:90%
from a position of lack.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The assumption
is they're not good enough.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:00.990 align:middle line:90%
They're not whole enough.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Or they're
not well enough.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.241 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or they're
not well enough.

00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Even though they
look perfectly well.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing you
can see externally.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And so even though they're
dedicated to improving

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.890 align:middle line:84%
their health, there is this
subconscious belief system

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:90%
they're not well enough.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Have you dealt with
people like that?

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, I
did everything you said,

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.770 align:middle line:90%
and nothing's happening.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I ask them,
what did you do,

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.960 align:middle line:84%
they basically tell me that
they did everything I said,

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.130 align:middle line:90%
They got close.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But they missed
one or two pieces.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes those one or
two pieces are so significant.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
that you take.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:42.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that you drink.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not an injection.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's not fresh air.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.720 align:middle line:90%
It is who you believe you are.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
If you think, for example,
that you have something

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.350 align:middle line:84%
wrong with you, and you
won't let go of that,

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:84%
you're basically reinforcing the
issue to remain in your body.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell folks when I work
with them, first, take a look

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:90%
at the things I've told you.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Understand these things.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Make this knowledge yours.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Feed your mind.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing I want
you to do afterwards,

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
start living as though this
isn't a problem for you

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:90%
any longer.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: You need to change
your mind about who you are

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.870 align:middle line:90%
and what's going on.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are folks who
say, well, how could I do that?

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I've got this terrible
pain, and how can I do that?

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:44.010 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Find a way.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Try.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Just try.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.270 align:middle line:90%
You were in terrible pain.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.229 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:51.229 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And now
how are you feeling?

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:53.686 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I feel good.

00:28:53.686 --> 00:28:58.097 align:middle line:84%
I really can barely feel the
burns now, barely at all.

00:28:58.097 --> 00:28:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's almost
an hour since I did it.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.055 align:middle line:90%
I told you it'd be an hour.

00:29:01.055 --> 00:29:03.162 align:middle line:90%


00:29:03.162 --> 00:29:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But I'm having fun.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.680 align:middle line:84%
See, I've already
moved on down the road.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.721 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, of course.

00:29:07.721 --> 00:29:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mentally, emotionally.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, the
point is, though,

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.390 align:middle line:84%
if you start living
as though you

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.610 align:middle line:84%
are something different
than what you are,

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.190 align:middle line:90%
you'll become that.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.540 align:middle line:84%
There's something very real
about seeing yourself different

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.210 align:middle line:84%
that compels every
cell in your body

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.350 align:middle line:90%
to move in a different way.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean move like
take a step to the left

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:90%
and step to the right.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Not a hokey pokey thing.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:38.596 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it is a state of
awareness within your body.

00:29:38.596 --> 00:29:39.720 align:middle line:90%
The consciousness is there.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.320 align:middle line:90%
You're awake.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:40.890 align:middle line:90%
You're alive.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:41.690 align:middle line:90%
You're breathing.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:42.750 align:middle line:90%
That's consciousness.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:47.280 align:middle line:84%
The awareness is how you see
yourself, what are you seeing?

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.170 align:middle line:10%
And it's in that
part of your reality

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.910 align:middle line:10%
that changes can
be made manifest.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:58.140 align:middle line:10%
Because now we're talking about
manifestation at its core.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And who you are is
basically a product

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.190 align:middle line:84%
of who you have believed
yourself to be all this time.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
I've noticed with people,

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and especially
people that I know,

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and friends who really
their whole focus

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.350 align:middle line:84%
is to wake up, and
research about health,

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.860 align:middle line:84%
take care of their bodies, get
the newest supplement, and so

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.660 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's very anxiety
producing for me to even listen

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:84%
to all of the incredible
amount of work

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:84%
it takes to live at that
level of whatever you

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:30.690 align:middle line:90%
want to call it.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
too I noticed in common

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.200 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of the people.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.260 align:middle line:84%
They tend to have
kind of long memories.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And so the patterning,
and like you say,

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.930 align:middle line:84%
the way they vision
themselves, often

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.600 align:middle line:84%
does something
from long ago that

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:84%
has long been kind of reversed
or moved past, but holding on

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:84%
to their feelings that
they're still not well.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It comes
down, Regina, to where

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:90%
is their fear really located?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.340 align:middle line:84%
What is the
intellectual process?

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people with
baskets full of supplements

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.020 align:middle line:84%
taking enough stuff to
where you don't have to eat.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.867 align:middle line:84%
Your stomach's full
of all these pills.

00:31:11.867 --> 00:31:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the water
it took to wash them down.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.230 align:middle line:90%
And why is it?

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:19.820 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.220 align:middle line:10%
Now, these are all
part of an aspect

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.860 align:middle line:10%
of manifestation and awareness.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And number one, there is
underlying doubt, or fear,

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.610 align:middle line:90%
or both--

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:84%
those are kind of
the same thing--

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:90%
that something is wrong.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:84%
I've got to do something
because I'm so afraid.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.800 align:middle line:84%
The second part of
this is to understand

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:84%
that if you have that going
on, you have no confidence.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:84%
There is no
confidence with fear.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.028 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
there's no confidence

00:31:47.028 --> 00:31:50.879 align:middle line:84%
in your own body's intelligence
and ability to recover either.

00:31:50.879 --> 00:31:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So when you take
a look at this overall,

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.510 align:middle line:84%
what you see is
that a person who's

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.130 align:middle line:84%
trying to grab a
hold of something,

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and struggle with it, and make
it what they imagine it should

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:04.320 align:middle line:84%
be, instead of allowing
it to be what it should

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.200 align:middle line:84%
be through the confidence of
knowing that they're going

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.890 align:middle line:84%
to be fine, they need to
just see themselves this way

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:11.529 align:middle line:90%
and just allow it to be.

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:84%
It comes down to what
I see a lot of people

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:90%
doing with prayer.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.380 align:middle line:84%
How many people do
you know that will

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.171 align:middle line:84%
sit there and pray for
the same thing over,

00:32:18.171 --> 00:32:19.370 align:middle line:90%
and over, and over again?

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:20.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.400 align:middle line:84%
It's showing a lack of
confidence in that very thing.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe that
it's going to work.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So they
have to keep asking.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:36.480 align:middle line:84%
That's where belief and knowing
become very black and white.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
knew, you wouldn't

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.680 align:middle line:90%
have to ask more than once.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to manifest
something, know what you want,

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and just direct the universe
to bring it to you the way

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:50.880 align:middle line:90%
that you expect it.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.144 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I mentioned
this on another show one time.

00:32:54.144 --> 00:32:55.726 align:middle line:84%
And I can't get into
any great detail.

00:32:55.726 --> 00:32:57.230 align:middle line:84%
It's another one
of our interviewees

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
that shared this process
of instant healing

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:90%
that I happen to intuitively--

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:08.210 align:middle line:84%
he told me one evening
on a Saturday evening--

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:11.015 align:middle line:90%
he's pretty well known.

00:33:11.015 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:84%
My guides were
telling his guides

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.250 align:middle line:84%
to tell me that I needed
to start healing again,

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.410 align:middle line:90%
but other people.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So he said, yeah, call me up,
and I'll show you what to do.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So a couple days
later I got this urge.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I woke up.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:25.780 align:middle line:90%
I have to know now.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I went
over, and he simply

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:84%
dumped out a bag of
notes onto the floor

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:36.540 align:middle line:84%
that were thank you notes from
people who had been healed.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I said I read
about half a dozen.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.870 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, that's enough.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
so what do I do?

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.494 align:middle line:84%
And he handed me
another piece of paper

00:33:44.494 --> 00:33:45.720 align:middle line:90%
with a paragraph on it.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Then he handed me this beautiful
picture of an angelic being,

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:84%
with their wings around a little
child that was being revived.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.270 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.560 align:middle line:90%
That was my lesson.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK,
well, thank you.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:90%
And I appreciate it.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.980 align:middle line:90%
And I left.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.688 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
a dear, dear friend

00:34:01.688 --> 00:34:03.112 align:middle line:90%
was having a stroke.

00:34:03.112 --> 00:34:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that
piece of paper.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Where's that piece of paper?

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:90%
And boom.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:90%
But this gets to the next point.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So I followed what was
on the paper to the T.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.489 align:middle line:90%
And it stopped itself.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
even find any markers

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:17.730 align:middle line:90%
when she was at the hospital.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:18.810 align:middle line:90%
It just stopped.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.574 align:middle line:90%
It reversed its symptoms.

00:34:20.574 --> 00:34:22.199 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't find any
markers in the blood.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:90%
She'd had a stroke.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:90%
And they wouldn't believe her.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Even though she had come
in, this side of her body.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is, I had
confidence in the other man,

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:90%
because I know he's real.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:84%
I had confidence
in my own ability,

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:37.980 align:middle line:84%
probably from past
lives, and doing it

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.420 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime too that
just simply follow this

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.639 align:middle line:84%
with a strong will
and an understanding.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.830 align:middle line:84%
But it collapses time to
a state of perfection.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:50.500 align:middle line:84%
There is no time in that
particular little healing

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.300 align:middle line:90%
modality.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.320 align:middle line:90%
It happens in a minute.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.556 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how often is it
that the person, especially

00:34:56.556 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:84%
if they're working
on themselves,

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:03.630 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have that same clarity,
or strength of mind, or will?

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.807 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, that's where
you have to help them.

00:35:05.807 --> 00:35:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I'm wondering, though,

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:10.380 align:middle line:84%
is because we're
taught in this society

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:84%
to give our power
away to everything.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Everything and everyone.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're going to
do the truth seeking part

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.120 align:middle line:90%
of our site, that's an agenda.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It is.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So sovereignty is not a desired
outcome for society at large.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So we lose our strength
of will and our clarity.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So how do we begin
re-instilling that in ourselves

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.660 align:middle line:84%
so that when it's time to
heal ourselves or others,

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.760 align:middle line:84%
we have that
absolute knowingness,

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and that strength
of mind to simply

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.730 align:middle line:84%
be able to project
and accomplish this?

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, it's
a bit of a journey.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.440 align:middle line:84%
There are ways of
doing it, I'm sure.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.810 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of philosophers
and truth speakers from ages

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:84%
immemorable who've
approached this, because this

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:56.610 align:middle line:90%
is an old question.

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line
is, know yourself.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Stop believing in other things.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Because belief is basically
suggesting that you're not sure

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:08.370 align:middle line:84%
if it's real or not, or
if it's got any value.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.310 align:middle line:84%
But I'll believe in
it until I have reason

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.970 align:middle line:90%
to believe in something else.

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Stop believing in
something else.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Start knowing yourself.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And what this
fellow did for you,

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:26.010 align:middle line:84%
he helped you to know yourself,
to have confidence in you.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:29.250 align:middle line:84%
However he accomplished
that, it worked.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And, look, you're still doing
a wonderful job of healing.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Your program is helping
immeasurable numbers of people.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.020 align:middle line:90%
On that level too.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So your presence
is a healing presence.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Healing through
knowledge is just

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.780 align:middle line:84%
as valuable as healing
through illness,

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.640 align:middle line:90%
bringing a person out of it.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
levels of healing.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.220 align:middle line:84%
You operate with a great
deal of confidence.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:57.780 align:middle line:90%
It's evident.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.809 align:middle line:90%
And you do it well.

00:36:59.809 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And this healing that you
do, whether it's on your show

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.730 align:middle line:84%
or in person, with working
on this person you're

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:11.010 align:middle line:84%
talking about or others,
this is you knowing yourself.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And for others who
want to approach this,

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.538 align:middle line:90%
not everybody's a healer.

00:37:16.538 --> 00:37:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody wants to be.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:18.510 align:middle line:90%
But some people do.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But even just to
take charge of your own being,

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:90%
your own well being.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
that's exactly right.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And taking charge
of your own being,

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and having that sovereign state
within yourself that I am.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the end
of that sentence

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:38.820 align:middle line:84%
is, however you imagine it to
be, when you know that you are,

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that's when the
entire cosmos starts

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:48.300 align:middle line:84%
working towards fulfilling
that desire within you.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Listen, energy doesn't
have any awareness really.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.100 align:middle line:84%
It just is like
water over a stone.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.360 align:middle line:84%
It's directed by
gravity with water.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.520 align:middle line:84%
But in this energy that's
permeating the universe,

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.850 align:middle line:90%
it's just flowing every place.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.960 align:middle line:84%
In order to harness it, it has
to be done through confidence.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's an emotional
state of being

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:90%
that causes this to occur.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:17.970 align:middle line:84%
When you have that emotional
aha moment, where you go,

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I know who I am, I
know I can do this,

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:30.361 align:middle line:84%
I am this, that's when all this
energy, you're like a magnet.

00:38:30.361 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It becomes coherent.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It does.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.780 align:middle line:90%
And you can start directing it.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.790 align:middle line:84%
That's why I did
those three classes

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.830 align:middle line:84%
that I have on my
website, so people

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:42.380 align:middle line:84%
can take those and get
some of this dime store

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.950 align:middle line:84%
philosophy of mine,
and put it to work

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.640 align:middle line:84%
so they can see the energy,
so they can move things

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.440 align:middle line:90%
with their mind.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.580 align:middle line:84%
They need to have a
tangible piece of evidence

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:84%
so that when it comes time
to really find out if this

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:59.520 align:middle line:90%
is real, there is no question.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Being able to see
energy is easy.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Moving things with
your mind is easy.

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:84%
But you have to get to
a point to where you

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:08.550 align:middle line:90%
are confident with who you are.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:13.680 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of what the
soul complex, higher mind

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and the body can do
together, it certainly

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.960 align:middle line:84%
goes beyond anything we could
even term as miraculous.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.450 align:middle line:84%
You've done a lot
of it yourself.

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:21.700 align:middle line:90%
We've seen it happen.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I've been involved in it, where
you see things just knit up

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:28.560 align:middle line:84%
in heal, in the moment, right
there, against all, quote,

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.190 align:middle line:90%
material, physical reality odds.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So this gets into
the notion that we

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:84%
each have essentially kind
of exit points in our lives.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.142 align:middle line:84%
I always call it
an expiration date.

00:39:46.142 --> 00:39:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And you might have two or three
potential expiration dates,

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.308 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
everyone's fearing is

00:39:50.308 --> 00:39:53.920 align:middle line:84%
loss of this reality when they
go into that kind of fear.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what that looks

00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.600 align:middle line:84%
like through your lens, the
notion of if you're scheduled

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.040 align:middle line:90%
to kind of have an exit point.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And your most
likely exit point is

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.130 align:middle line:84%
going to happen when
you're 93 years old,

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and you're 50 years old, and you
discovered something just awful

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:14.510 align:middle line:84%
going on in your body, what
happens if you understand

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.760 align:middle line:84%
that your body and your soul
is capable of taking care

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:84%
of anything, and you're not
going until it's your moment,

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.980 align:middle line:90%
you're agreed upon moment to go?

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.510 align:middle line:90%
What's your philosophy on it?

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, you're right.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't go until it's
your time, unless you

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.660 align:middle line:90%
push the point, or you give up.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get to
the reverse of that too.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.540 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:39.000 align:middle line:84%
As far as an exit point, I
fell out of an airplane hangar

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and died.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.900 align:middle line:90%
That was a big splat.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: That was a big splat.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:90%
And it hurt--

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.282 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In a lot of ways.

00:40:46.282 --> 00:40:47.082 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:40:47.082 --> 00:40:48.556 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't comfortable.

00:40:48.556 --> 00:40:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I came back
it wasn't comfortable.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.540 align:middle line:84%
It didn't hurt so bad
when I was sitting

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.840 align:middle line:84%
upon a cloud looking to myself
going, oh, how about that.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm dead.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm dead.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:84%
What I've seen with so many
people I've worked with--

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and some people I've
worked with have expired.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:04.380 align:middle line:90%
They've gone.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.590 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:11.160 align:middle line:90%
I believe-- no.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I know that a person will
not go until it's their time.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that there
is a delineated point of exit.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:24.490 align:middle line:90%
I think it's implied.

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:28.150 align:middle line:84%
That when you get to this point,
and these things are happening,

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.140 align:middle line:90%
if you choose to go, you can.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.430 align:middle line:84%
That's what I call different
kind of exit points.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:36.990 align:middle line:84%
You can call them kind
of crisis choice points.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Probably there is
one or two that

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.180 align:middle line:84%
are more likely than
others where these

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.420 align:middle line:90%
are going to come together.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.878 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So many
people I've worked

00:41:44.878 --> 00:41:50.190 align:middle line:84%
with who have since
passed on, these folks

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:53.890 align:middle line:84%
knew that it was
going to happen.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:58.200 align:middle line:84%
They knew it was going to happen
in the last couple of weeks.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.825 align:middle line:84%
And I was called in to see
if I could make a difference.

00:42:00.825 --> 00:42:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, usually when people
call me in, in these instances

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.260 align:middle line:84%
anyway, I get called in
when there's no hope.

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.643 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Now, if
they'd have called me

00:42:09.643 --> 00:42:12.240 align:middle line:84%
in like six months
earlier maybe.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.130 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:84%
These folks, there was
really no hope for this.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I told them
that's what I saw.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Cause I don't want
to tell any stories.

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I want to be honest
with each person.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And it hurts my heart sometimes
to say that, but at least

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.530 align:middle line:90%
it's honest.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:30.330 align:middle line:90%
No games.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:33.250 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:39.960 align:middle line:84%
In every instance,
once they knew,

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.920 align:middle line:90%
it was like, OK, that's fine.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.770 align:middle line:84%
All the records, all
the medical things

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.200 align:middle line:84%
said that there's
no hope of survival.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.974 align:middle line:90%
Now they've accepted it.

00:42:51.974 --> 00:42:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're in a lot of pain,
because most of these people

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.450 align:middle line:90%
had cancer.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:58.680 align:middle line:90%
And I said, give me your pain.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.150 align:middle line:90%
You don't need it any longer.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.530 align:middle line:90%
It's served its purpose.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And I run my hand over their
body, actually both hands.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.570 align:middle line:90%
And their pain goes away.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And they no longer
have any issues.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And they pass over peacefully,
usually, with their loved ones

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:18.060 align:middle line:90%
nearby.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's happened
so many times.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Not to say that there had been
those who were expected to go

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.510 align:middle line:90%
that didn't.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's because it
wasn't their time.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.030 align:middle line:84%
I bring that up, because it
seems to me, that's really

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.790 align:middle line:84%
the X factor here is
this understanding.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:40.844 align:middle line:84%
Because all of society
is set up to make

00:43:40.844 --> 00:43:42.260 align:middle line:84%
us feel like we're
not well enough

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.430 align:middle line:90%
and we're not good enough.

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And we certainly better
not rely on ourselves.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.480 align:middle line:84%
There are experts to
take care of that for us.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of a
walking time bomb

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.570 align:middle line:84%
of neuroses just waiting
for something to get us,

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:56.370 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.994 align:middle line:84%
But if we understood, there's
this incredible grace.

00:43:59.994 --> 00:44:01.910 align:middle line:84%
There are these times
when it's time to leave,

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:03.410 align:middle line:90%
and there's the time to be here.

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And maybe before we get into
some of the epidemic things

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that you're seeing
and working with,

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe give us one of
your most miraculous

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:13.470 align:middle line:84%
stories about this
person should be so gone,

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:16.400 align:middle line:84%
but this spirit was so
strong, besides yourself,

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.280 align:middle line:90%
that here they are.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.940 align:middle line:90%


00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Gosh.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.230 align:middle line:90%
There are quite a few like that.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I think the most dramatic
one that I can pull up

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.730 align:middle line:84%
at the moment has to do with
a little girl named Natalie.

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:34.930 align:middle line:90%
And this was so many years ago.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Natalie was, I don't remember
now, seven, eight years old.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Childhood leukemia.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.480 align:middle line:84%
They tried everything,
lots of chemo.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Nothing worked.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.470 align:middle line:90%
They had a feeding tube.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:51.830 align:middle line:84%
She was just a
little pretty face

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:55.280 align:middle line:84%
with a mostly hairless
head on a pillow,

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.530 align:middle line:84%
with tremendous
amounts of morphine

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:59.836 align:middle line:90%
coursing through her body.

00:44:59.836 --> 00:45:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And the feeding tube
to keep her alive.

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And they had basically
told the family

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:08.520 align:middle line:84%
that she would probably not
make it through the night.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I was called in.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I found out what
the problems were.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I found out why it happened.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:21.200 align:middle line:84%
It had to do with relationships
in the family that were very

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:90%
troubling to her, to Natalie.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And I set about changing things.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.420 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.720 align:middle line:10%
And the story, I
think, is in the book.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.620 align:middle line:10%
"Healer, The Jerry Wills Story."

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, this was on Good Friday.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:84%
On Easter Sunday, I went
back to the hospital

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and stood beside
Natalie as she wrapped

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:49.220 align:middle line:84%
her head in a little scarf,
feeding tube gone, no cancer.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.140 align:middle line:84%
No problems really,
except to recover

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.330 align:middle line:90%
from all she'd been through.

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:55.980 align:middle line:84%
She'd been sleeping through
the night every night since,

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and now Natalie has
gone through college,

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and I think she
has her own family.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:07.440 align:middle line:84%
It was an extraordinary
thing to witness.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.054 align:middle line:90%
It was so many years ago.

00:46:09.054 --> 00:46:10.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how many years.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.520 align:middle line:90%
30 years or more.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.085 align:middle line:84%
There's Kelly,
the guy from Tonga

00:46:16.085 --> 00:46:18.350 align:middle line:84%
that got beat in the face,
and kicked in the face

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:21.470 align:middle line:84%
with steel toed shoes, and
beat in the face with a shovel.

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't expected to live.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.030 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:27.305 align:middle line:90%
I was called to the hospital.

00:46:27.305 --> 00:46:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Took a look.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:33.520 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty bad.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.790 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even touch him.

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:90%
I just put my hands near him.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Saw the problems.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Fixed it.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And then instead of
dying that afternoon,

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:47.710 align:middle line:90%
he woke up the next day.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's fine now, except he
lost an eye because the doctors

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:52.670 align:middle line:90%
did that to him.

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:55.570 align:middle line:90%
They had to.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:58.265 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
stories like this.

00:46:58.265 --> 00:47:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just
shows that the strength

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.450 align:middle line:84%
of the will of the human
spirit, of the soul

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.310 align:middle line:84%
to continue on,
if you can remove

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:10.180 align:middle line:84%
an impediment in this case,
like you say with Natalie,

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.820 align:middle line:84%
did you start
talking to or working

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.970 align:middle line:84%
with the family in terms
of what was going on?

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or just through her?

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:20.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
anything about her.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I just got a
phone call as it happens.

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:26.103 align:middle line:84%
I mean, after you realized
there were family issues that

00:47:26.103 --> 00:47:27.030 align:middle line:90%
were plaguing her.

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, well, I
saw it in her memories.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.312 align:middle line:84%
Like I was saying before,
I see a lot of things.

00:47:32.312 --> 00:47:33.520 align:middle line:90%
And I saw it in the memories.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And I saw all of it.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you worked
with that part of her too?

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So I talked
to the family.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:39.998 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: While we're
in the room watching

00:47:39.998 --> 00:47:43.090 align:middle line:84%
her potentially
expire, I said you guys

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:44.225 align:middle line:90%
are responsible for this.

00:47:44.225 --> 00:47:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you talking
about on the psychic plane

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.110 align:middle line:90%
you said this to them?

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:48.130 align:middle line:90%
I told them in person.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or on
the physical plane.

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:49.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was asking.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:50.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Said, this
is what's gone wrong.

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:54.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry folks.

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:90%
But this is what's happened.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:00.990 align:middle line:90%
You need to fix this.

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:02.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll fix her.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:03.220 align:middle line:90%
You fix this.

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
fix this, nothing I do

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.409 align:middle line:90%
is going to make a difference.

00:48:06.409 --> 00:48:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, my
first question would be,

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.980 align:middle line:84%
how did her family
respond to the news?

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
they were shocked.

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I wasn't
supposed to know anything

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.800 align:middle line:84%
about the intrinsic workings
of their family or what issues

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.400 align:middle line:90%
were happening.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't supposed
to know any of that.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:25.620 align:middle line:90%
But I did, because I found it.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And they were
embarrassed and shocked.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this
is what you need

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to do if you want this
little girl to live.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.290 align:middle line:90%
This is how you do it.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:38.770 align:middle line:90%
And I had them be participants.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:43.480 align:middle line:84%
When it comes down
to how all of this

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.720 align:middle line:84%
manages itself, working
with this little girl,

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:84%
for example, or working with
Kelly, who is completely

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.000 align:middle line:84%
unconscious, and
nearly brain dead,

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and bleeding on the brain,
they're not expected to live,

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:56.770 align:middle line:84%
or any of these
other people, they

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:59.109 align:middle line:84%
don't have a state of
belief in me at all.

00:48:59.109 --> 00:49:00.400 align:middle line:90%
They don't even know I'm there.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So it isn't
a question of what

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.871 align:middle line:84%
someone else has in mind of what
they accept or don't accept.

00:49:09.871 --> 00:49:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it does
matter that the soul

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.930 align:middle line:84%
is ready to heal, and
accept, and continue living.

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.569 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's always
down to that choice.

00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, those are beautiful.

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.206 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have just a
little bit of time left.

00:49:21.206 --> 00:49:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to talk
about some of the things

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.660 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing that are kind
of almost becoming epidemic,

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.862 align:middle line:84%
even since we talked
a few years ago.

00:49:27.862 --> 00:49:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Which if anyone wants to
know about your whole story,

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:31.445 align:middle line:84%
they need to go
back to interview

00:49:31.445 --> 00:49:35.440 align:middle line:84%
number one, and including
the point where you're

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.040 align:middle line:84%
about 19 years old, and
a tent revivalist faith

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.010 align:middle line:84%
healer takes you under his wing
and says, you can do stuff.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:45.800 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you a red Corvette,
and you'll have a nice suit,

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.511 align:middle line:84%
and all the babes
you want if you

00:49:47.511 --> 00:49:48.760 align:middle line:90%
want to come and work with us.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: And plenty of money.

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And plenty of money.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And you said, no thank you.

00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:53.355 align:middle line:84%
I think because they
were going to have

00:49:53.355 --> 00:49:54.560 align:middle line:90%
you cut your hair off too.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.765 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I'd have
to stop smoking pot.

00:49:56.765 --> 00:49:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you'd have
to stop smoking pot.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Stop listening
to rock and roll.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I couldn't
drink a beer.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I
couldn't swear anymore.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
things that I enjoy.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Of course,
I'm not swearing now

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.140 align:middle line:90%
because it's being polite.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.660 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is that
when it comes right down

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:22.720 align:middle line:84%
to what others see you
as or expect you to be,

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.820 align:middle line:84%
you're either going to
wear a mask to please them,

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:25.760 align:middle line:90%
or you're going to be yourself.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.898 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I figured, if I
have to do all this stuff just

00:50:28.898 --> 00:50:31.164 align:middle line:90%
to get a nice red Ford Mustang--

00:50:31.164 --> 00:50:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, Mustang.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:32.596 align:middle line:90%
Not Corvette.

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:33.396 align:middle line:90%
Got ya.

00:50:33.396 --> 00:50:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: A convertible.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.440 align:middle line:90%
I've tried to sit in a Corvette.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.751 align:middle line:90%
They're too small.

00:50:37.751 --> 00:50:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't
working for you.

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:40.870 align:middle line:84%
The point is, you just
said, no thank you,

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and went on your way, and
did your healing anyway.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I just continued with
what I was doing.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that whole
story, in interview number one

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.750 align:middle line:84%
in the Gaia archives, I'd
recommend people go back to it

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:50.850 align:middle line:90%
and take a peek.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So continuing along
the lines of epidemics,

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.250 align:middle line:84%
what are you seeing even in
younger parts of the population

00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:00.010 align:middle line:84%
that's really starting to
rise, and we need to look out

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:02.057 align:middle line:90%
for it in our own well-being?

00:51:02.057 --> 00:51:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: There are
a number of things.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:07.060 align:middle line:84%
But it all comes right down
to the endocrine system.

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:11.350 align:middle line:84%
People don't understand that
their hormonal system directs

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:14.170 align:middle line:84%
how their body
functions, whether it's

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.450 align:middle line:84%
growing hair, and
nails, or skin,

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:20.530 align:middle line:84%
or repairing the pads
in their vertebrae,

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:26.470 align:middle line:84%
or their major organs, or
their eyes, or whatever.

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:30.450 align:middle line:10%
The hormonal system of the
body is incredibly powerful

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:33.450 align:middle line:10%
because it directs all of
these things to happen.

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:36.100 align:middle line:10%
Have someone with a bad
thyroid and see how they feel.

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:36.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:42.090 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLS: Have somebody with low
testosterone or, in a woman's

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:44.820 align:middle line:10%
case, still low testosterone.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Women have testosterone.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Look how they feel.

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.420 align:middle line:84%
The epidemic that I'm seeing
with people right now,

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and I have been seeing
for the past many years,

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.902 align:middle line:84%
is that folks don't
know about this.

00:51:58.902 --> 00:52:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I tell
them about it, it's

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.980 align:middle line:90%
like, really, are you serious?

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.440 align:middle line:84%
That could be the responsible
party of what's going on?

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I keep seeing
it person to person.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:10.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why it's happening.

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, wait a minute.

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:12.800 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that we
talked about off camera,

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and we've talked
about it before,

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:17.280 align:middle line:84%
is the incredible load of
industrial and other types

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.130 align:middle line:84%
of pollutants and the
way they're affecting--

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:22.810 align:middle line:84%
they're disruptors to
our endocrine system.

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, there
are so many disruptors--

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.640 align:middle line:84%
bisphenol A. I mean,
how many people

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.140 align:middle line:84%
drink water out of
a plastic bottle.

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: What's in that water?

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And most folks
say, well, if it's

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.190 align:middle line:84%
in there it's just
like that much.

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:41.490 align:middle line:90%
How much is too much?

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And like you said
earlier, they're

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:46.350 align:middle line:84%
trusting some other person
in a power of authority

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:49.000 align:middle line:90%
to tell them that it's OK.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Whether it comes down to some
kind of additive in their food,

00:52:55.830 --> 00:53:01.920 align:middle line:84%
or fluoride in their toothpaste,
or salt that has no iodine,

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.820 align:middle line:84%
or some other industrial
chemical solvent.

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So if people want to make a
difference in their lives,

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:13.590 align:middle line:90%
they need to become educated.

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And trusting other people
to tell you the truth,

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.490 align:middle line:90%
it might be a mistake.

00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:24.660 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking that the
people who are in that position

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:28.650 align:middle line:84%
are going to tell
you accurately,

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:34.369 align:middle line:84%
as far as the endocrine
system, bisphenol A kills it.

00:53:34.369 --> 00:53:35.910 align:middle line:84%
How many bottles of
water do you have

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to drink before it damages
the epithelial cells,

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and they no longer function and
produce any of the hormones?

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm glad
you brought this up,

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and the way you did, because
this has such a broad effect

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:51.690 align:middle line:84%
within the human body that
everyone responds differently

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:54.020 align:middle line:84%
to a disruption in their
endocrine function.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what kind of
diseases can that look like?

00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh my goodness.

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Pretty
much everything?

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: How about something
wrong with your eyes,

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.470 align:middle line:84%
to ringing in your ears,
to heart conditions,

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:08.595 align:middle line:90%
to your bowels not working.

00:54:08.595 --> 00:54:13.050 align:middle line:90%


00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On and on.

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I mean, there
are so many things.

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just pick a
thing, and name it,

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.280 align:middle line:90%
and you probably hit a bullseye.

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can probably
trace it back, in its origins,

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.970 align:middle line:84%
to some malfunction in
the endocrine system.

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to me that
obviously number one

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.510 align:middle line:84%
is you've got to go with the
cleanest source of everything

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:31.684 align:middle line:90%
you can possibly find.

00:54:31.684 --> 00:54:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: If you can find it.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If you can find it.

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:34.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.890 align:middle line:90%


00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:38.800 align:middle line:90%
And that makes sense.

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people go on
cleanses, and healing diets,

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:43.620 align:middle line:90%
and obviously organic.

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Eat organically as much
as you possibly can.

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Don't drink stuff out of
a bottle and so forth.

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:52.320 align:middle line:84%
What else can we do to
protect our endocrine systems

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.150 align:middle line:90%
and give them a fighting chance?

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And can we repair them
once they've been damaged.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No.

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.280 align:middle line:90%
I can't even fix that.

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.270 align:middle line:90%
I've tried.

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I tried with Kathy.

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:03.450 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't.

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I've tried with so many
people, even myself.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Those cells are about as
fragile as a butterfly's wings

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.710 align:middle line:90%
in a flame.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And when they're gone,
they're gone forever,

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:18.300 align:middle line:84%
unless something happens
and science comes up

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.950 align:middle line:84%
with a new way of
doing something.

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:22.770 align:middle line:90%
But as it stands now, no.

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:26.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So clean it up
as best you possibly can.

00:55:26.775 --> 00:55:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, but
see, you're talking

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.135 align:middle line:84%
about people who are our
age looking at this going,

00:55:31.135 --> 00:55:32.470 align:middle line:90%
well, we got to clean this up.

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It's too late.

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:38.674 align:middle line:84%
So really this message needs
to go into your kids' lives.

00:55:38.674 --> 00:55:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: The 20 something's.

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:41.760 align:middle line:90%
And your kids' kids.

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: And younger.

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Because you see, you're
looking at people like us.

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm 63.

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't thinking about
this stuff when I was 27 or 28.

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I'd grab a bottle of
water and drink it down.

00:55:57.690 --> 00:55:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Been sitting in the sun.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:00.090 align:middle line:90%
It tastes a little off.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.080 align:middle line:90%
So what.

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm thirsty.

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:02.450 align:middle line:90%
I drink it.

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:05.280 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:09.210 align:middle line:90%
These are cumulative poisons.

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And the things that I'm seeing
that are disabling people

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:18.150 align:middle line:84%
now are in the age range of
the late 40s and higher in age,

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:21.450 align:middle line:84%
where these things
have damaged them.

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know how
to cope with the issues,

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.180 align:middle line:84%
whether it's things like
arthritis, inflammation

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.320 align:middle line:90%
in the fingers or the joints.

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Why is that happening to me?

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Or heart conditions.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Or they're just putting
on lots of weight.

00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:36.240 align:middle line:90%
They can't get it off.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.970 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to eat well.

00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:40.540 align:middle line:84%
They're taking lots
of supplements.

00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Going back to what
I said earlier,

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:48.290 align:middle line:84%
they're moving in a level
of apprehension, and fear,

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:49.900 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know what to do.

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we only have
a couple minutes left.

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
saying, OK, that's me.

00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:56.560 align:middle line:90%
That sounds just like me.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.610 align:middle line:90%
What can we do?

00:56:57.610 --> 00:56:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we can
always do something.

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, you
can do something.

00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:05.950 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know what it is.

00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Because, you see, every
person is different.

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:11.550 align:middle line:90%
And because they're different--

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:14.980 align:middle line:84%
When I'm working with someone,
I can look inside and see,

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and I can make an assessment,
and then say, oh, well,

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:18.430 align:middle line:90%
here you go.

00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.850 align:middle line:90%
This and this.

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:20.242 align:middle line:90%
That's one off though.

00:57:20.242 --> 00:57:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
that other thing we

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:25.560 align:middle line:84%
talked about, about having
that internal confidence

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.360 align:middle line:90%
in yourself.

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:26.525 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, yeah.

00:57:26.525 --> 00:57:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
it's not your time.

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:30.056 align:middle line:84%
So even though you may have
a little corruption here

00:57:30.056 --> 00:57:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and there and your endocrine
system not optimized,

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:36.550 align:middle line:84%
just by applying that level
of confidence to our lives,

00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:38.920 align:middle line:84%
certainly it can
shift something within

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.210 align:middle line:84%
so at least if the anxiety's
taken away, at whatever level

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:45.640 align:middle line:84%
our immune system or
our endocrine system

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.790 align:middle line:84%
is functioning, it can kind of
continue on till our expiration

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:49.960 align:middle line:90%
date, right?

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.670 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:53.470 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:57.820 align:middle line:84%
The level of confidence that
you have within yourself,

00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.440 align:middle line:90%
keep that going.

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.250 align:middle line:90%
Be confident.

00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:02.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:06.250 align:middle line:84%
If there isn't a solution for
whatever is bothering you,

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.260 align:middle line:84%
then live confidently
with what you have.

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And see yourself as
something different than what

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.820 align:middle line:84%
you see when you
look in the mirror,

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.830 align:middle line:84%
or what you think
when you reflect back

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:18.870 align:middle line:84%
on the past period of time where
you've not been very happy.

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's because of
emotional stresses or health

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:23.410 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:24.730 align:middle line:90%
See yourself differently.

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Be the person that
you really imagine

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:31.450 align:middle line:84%
would be the happy person,
the happy version of you.

00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:33.430 align:middle line:90%
Live in confidence.

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:37.510 align:middle line:10%
And if there's something
that you want to find out,

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:39.850 align:middle line:10%
you want to find out
why this is happening,

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:42.850 align:middle line:10%
what you can do about
it, well, there's

00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:44.560 align:middle line:10%
a way of getting a hold of me.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll be happy to try and help.

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As you did me again.

00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: How are your fingers?

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They don't hurt.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Perfect.

00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you said
it would be an hour.

00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And I did not believe that
the pain would go away that

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:00.190 align:middle line:84%
quickly, even though
I know you, and I know

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:02.650 align:middle line:90%
what all bodies are capable of.

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:05.110 align:middle line:84%
I was really surprised
when I'd say 80% of it

00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:06.260 align:middle line:90%
was gone in 10 minutes.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:08.170 align:middle line:90%
So I love you to pieces, Jerry.

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for saving
the day personally

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:13.460 align:middle line:84%
