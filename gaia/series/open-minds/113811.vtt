00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Nearly 30
years ago, I produced a series

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.659 align:middle line:10%
on the nightly news
about using psychics

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:10%
effectively to solve crime.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Still, this has not become
a mainstream practice

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.660 align:middle line:84%
due to the prejudice
about dipping

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:84%
into the less understood
world of the psyche.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, the practice
hasn't gone away.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And one might argue it
should be on the increase

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to adding new
clues to a case gone cold.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.400 align:middle line:84%
We have with us today Robbie
Thomas, a lifelong crime

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:84%
fighter, using his
intuitive skills

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
to help solve what has been
insolvable or unsolvable.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:90%
I love your hat.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBBIE THOMAS: Thank you.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and your
earrings and your tattoos.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
You're quite the
picture-- beautiful.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Whole nine yards.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.198 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So first of all-- I mean,
we have a fair amount

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to talk about
today, so I thought

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:84%
we would start when
you were a little kid.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.289 align:middle line:84%
You look like a guy that
should be on a Harley, right?

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you are on
a Harley, but the fact

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
is you're surrounded
with daughters,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and you've always
been super sensitive,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and you were very sensitive
toward your mother as well.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about stuff from
when you were a little kid.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Absolutely.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:10%
Being the age of two and
three, you're inquisitive,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:10%
you're a child, and you're
always poking your nose

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:10%
into everything.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.605 align:middle line:10%
So I would approach
my mother at times

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:10%
and say, either I'm
adopted or I have someone

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:10%
out there who's a part
of me and adopted.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And she'd say, Ron--
that's my father's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:90%
name-- he's doing it again.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
My father would say, Robbie,
quit it and get in here.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:90%
So then it would stop.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And then again, I would
approach my mother

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and keep poking at her about
either a part of me out there.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Take you full circle to
1994, my mom passed away.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:84%
My family pulled
me aside and said,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:90%
she's been looking for you.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
because I'm still

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.839 align:middle line:84%
distraught from
my mother passing.

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.755 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, she's
been looking for you,

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and she's the spitting
image of your mom.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
So her name's Mary, and so
I got introduced to Mary.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who said this?

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.139 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I'm sorry, my
mom's brother and sister.

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: After the funeral.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.605 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: After the funeral, OK.

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I met my sister for the
first time in all those years.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And so now going back to
being that nosy child,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
it kind of paid
off, because that's

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:84%
when I was sensing and
being told that there was

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.359 align:middle line:90%
another part of me out there.

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.358 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where was she?

00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:45.770 align:middle line:84%
What had happened
to your sister?

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Back in
the early '60s,

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Roman Catholic-- the church,
my mother being unwed,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:90%
became pregnant.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You went to a
home, and then the kids

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:90%
were adopted out.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.016 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right.

00:02:57.016 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:90%
So they took her daughter.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And then years later,
she met my father,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
married him, and had me, the
one who was poking his nose.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.494 align:middle line:84%
But you were still feeling
like there was something,

00:03:08.494 --> 00:03:09.660 align:middle line:90%
you had a sibling out there.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.076 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: There was something
out there, yeah, absolutely.

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And so come full
circle, I meet Mary,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and then FOX Radio
does this big special

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:84%
in 1994, which was uplifting,
because I lost a piece of me

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:90%
and then I gained a piece of me.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was something like
a present left behind

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:90%
for me from my mother.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.424 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
there was something

00:03:28.424 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
surrounding your mother's
departure as well, as I recall.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yes.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:90%
And we all have our signs.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this sign was the
night prior to her passing,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:84%
which they said her
cancer was cured.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Everything was fine.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:90%
I met with the doctors.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.051 align:middle line:84%
I was the one who was taking
her down for her radiation

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:90%
treatments.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And so they said
she's in remission.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Come that night, it was
almost like a suppression.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
can relate to this, where

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:90%
they feel they're trapped.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:90%
They can't move.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:90%
They're struggling.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.969 align:middle line:84%
And they're having an
apparition or a vision to them.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was the four horsemen.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And the one horseman
was in white and said,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing to worry about.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:90%
You'll be taken care of.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he showed me what
was going to happen that day.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
After that moment with them
and coming to the morning,

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.404 align:middle line:84%
I usually go to
my mother's house

00:04:20.404 --> 00:04:22.630 align:middle line:84%
for coffee-- I'm a
mommy's boy-- and have

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:90%
tea or coffee or toast.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And I approached into her
kitchen, sat down in the chair,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:90%
and I addressed to her.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.106 align:middle line:84%
She's not looking
at me, and I said,

00:04:31.106 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm compelled to have
to tell you this.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And I explained what
happened last night.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.450 align:middle line:84%
She said to me, well,
you go come home,

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'll call you later
to watch your daughter.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt kind of funny,
how she's asking me to leave.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's that
push-pull factor, where

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:84%
you know you want to stay
because there's an urgency,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:84%
but you have to leave
because you've been asked.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:90%
So I leave.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:90%
Nonetheless, I'm at home.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting with my
wife, and my good friend

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:90%
came over after.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.804 align:middle line:84%
And we're drinking coffee,
and the phone rings.

00:05:01.804 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's about an
hour and a half later.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.467 align:middle line:84%
And my father's on the
other line screaming,

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:06.175 align:middle line:90%
it's your mother!

00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It's your mother!

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:90%
So we raced over.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.715 align:middle line:84%
And what I remember is
the EMTs pulling her out

00:05:11.715 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:84%
on the gurney, her
little purple sock,

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
her hand hanging over
the side, the one

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:90%
EMT on top doing compressions.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.849 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it was
that moment where--

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She knew.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: She knew.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She asked you
to leave for a reason.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: She knew.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.599 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And oftentimes
when people do pass,

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.812 align:middle line:84%
it's when they're
alone and often

00:05:31.812 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
night where there's no one

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:84%
to create the drag on them
when they're trying to release

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:90%
themselves from the body.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right, right.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
It's that integral moment when
spirit steps in and takes those

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.660 align:middle line:84%
problems and those problematic
moments away from--

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.717 align:middle line:84%
even the burden,
if you will, on--

00:05:49.717 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yes.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's funny
because so many of us

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:84%
think, oh, God, I don't
want to die alone.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'd love for my children
to be with me or my husband

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:90%
or wife or whatnot.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But then you slip away
at 2:00 in the morning

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
when nobody's
there, or whoever's

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:84%
there is asleep in the
chair, because the soul needs

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.232 align:middle line:90%
to do its own thing.

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: That's right.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.023 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is not
a sentimental process.

00:06:09.023 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not a project.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: But yeah,
and that's perfect,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:84%
because it's like
signs from heaven.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And I speak very much
about signs from heaven

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and how we're all
in this interlude

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and how we have the
retainment, if you will,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:84%
of spirit, because we
have our spirit guides,

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
we have our angels, and they
do caress us, if you will,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:90%
all through our lives.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a gradual
progression of atonement.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's how we are.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And so this whole
notion of people leaving

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:84%
their lives, a lot
of them in the cases

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that you work on, violently,
people disappearing, people

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.130 align:middle line:84%
being murdered, cases
that are difficult.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.270 align:middle line:84%
When Jerry Wills,
who I've interviewed,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
first introduced
me to you, he said,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:84%
he's kind of like Allison
DuBois, but he's the real deal.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:90%
He's the real Medium.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: That's
quite the compliment.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But as a kid,
you knew right away

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.210 align:middle line:90%
you wanted to be in crime.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:90%
You wanted to fight crime.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:90%
What was that in you?

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: That in
me was a drive.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:90%
That was a drive.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
There were two
professions, if you will.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Father Pidelt had a very
overbearing draw to me,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and I was so much wanting
to be a priest when

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.800 align:middle line:90%
I was a young child.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't understand
why they spoke Latin facing away

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
from you, or to you, or they
turned and they were away.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Then they sung different
things in church.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And growing up, I kind
of have my own grievances

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:90%
of why they would do that.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:90%
And it was an inner struggle.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So then I wanted to
be a police officer.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
So then I want through to
be a police officer twice,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.882 align:middle line:90%
hired and fired in one day.

00:07:51.882 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah talk about
that, how you somehow

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.700 align:middle line:84%
got under the wire as
an underage young man.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yes, I did.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:90%
I infiltrated the police.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because
I did all the testing.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:90%
I did all the written part.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were taking three
auxiliaries that day.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.682 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in Chief Cook's office,
and we're signing papers.

00:08:11.682 --> 00:08:12.890 align:middle line:90%
He does the other two fellas.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:90%
I let them go first.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.988 align:middle line:84%
And then he looks at mine
and sees the date of birth,

00:08:15.988 --> 00:08:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and he just had a big
chuckle and he said, son,

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.550 align:middle line:90%
you come back when you're 20.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.183 align:middle line:84%
I looked 20 because
I had a moustache.

00:08:22.183 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] And
you were 17 years old.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I was 17 years of age.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.034 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's
talk-- so you came back.

00:08:28.034 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I came back.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.284 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:08:30.284 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's pick it up from there.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.761 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Sure.

00:08:32.761 --> 00:08:34.469 align:middle line:84%
I went through to be
a police officer out

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
of a town outside of Toronto,
Canada, Peel Regional Police.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I got hired on, did the final
brass interviews, come home.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm elated, tired
from all the testing

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
days of doing the physical
and then the written.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I finally come home.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting in the
kitchen, and I hear,

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:90%
accident, accident, screaming.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lady
behind the fence

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
of my home in the
townhomes that were

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:90%
running like this to the road.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So I hopped the fence, and first
thing is a reaction to help.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at her, and
she's pointing down the laneway.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So I run that direction,
and I'm thinking

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:84%
car accident because that's
all I heard, was "accident."

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.669 align:middle line:90%
And I look out the road.

00:09:12.669 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:90%
There's no cars.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:14.902 align:middle line:90%
Traffic's fine.

00:09:14.902 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Then I look to my
left, and there's

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.077 align:middle line:90%
a gentleman by the screen door.

00:09:18.077 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And he's going, come here.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:90%
He's waving me over like this.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:90%
So I run over to him.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.955 align:middle line:84%
I walk into the
kitchen area, and there

00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:28.110 align:middle line:84%
was a lady to the left running
around the table screaming.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was a gentleman to
my right holding a doorknob.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.840 align:middle line:90%
And he says, come here.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So I go over to him, he grabs
my shoulder, opens the door,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:90%
shoves me in, shuts the door.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm still
thinking accident.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking for
blood on the floor.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And I look up, and
there's a gentleman.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And he's sitting in the
bathroom, and he's passed.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But his eyes are gone
directly on to me.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Unnerving.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unnerving, yes.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: [LAUGHING] To
say the least, right?

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if no one's
home, someone was around.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.876 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, yeah, right.

00:09:59.876 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So out the window goes all this
bravado of everything, right?

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And then right away,
CPR, check for vitals.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:90%
So I run over.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:90%
I see his lips are blue.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:90%
And he's kind of pale.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I check for vitals,
and I start to do CPR.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.594 align:middle line:84%
No sooner do I start doing
CPR, I hear, let me go.

00:10:19.594 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So I step back for a
moment, and I'm thinking,

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
this is my imagination,
and then, no.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.235 align:middle line:84%
So I go back right away again
and touch for vitals, CPR.

00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And I hear it really
loud, clears as a bell,

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.190 align:middle line:90%
let me go, deep voice.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.285 align:middle line:90%
I stop.

00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I back up.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:90%
I walk out the door.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And everybody's standing there.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Now there's not three people.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.625 align:middle line:84%
There's a ton of people, and
they're all staring at me.

00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And I just shake my head like
this, and that put everything

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:90%
in an uproar, right?

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Turns out it was my
sister's best friend's

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.660 align:middle line:90%
father, a small world.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment on, I
knew I had a different route

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.987 align:middle line:90%
to take.

00:10:58.987 --> 00:11:00.403 align:middle line:84%
I call up, and I
say, I don't want

00:11:00.403 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:90%
to be a police officer no more.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:90%
You just don't quit.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:90%
They want to know why.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So they sent the captain,
a sergeant from the Chatham

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.480 align:middle line:84%
police force-- it's in
Ontario-- a film crew.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:90%
And they come into my home.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was presumptuous.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.520 align:middle line:90%
They want to know why you quit.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they said,
we're doing a movie

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.325 align:middle line:84%
on first responders
who quit under duress.

00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And we'd like you to
be part of this model.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:90%
So I agreed.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't stressed.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.866 align:middle line:84%
I just went, all
right, come in my home.

00:11:34.866 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So they did, and they
asked me the questions.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.822 align:middle line:84%
So I answered vigorously
and straightforward.

00:11:39.822 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, you should
have seen the look

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
on their face and their
jaws, because when I said,

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.606 align:middle line:84%
he said let me go, and
I'm hearing this man,

00:11:46.606 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
it's not because I'm
quitting because I don't

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:90%
want to be a police officer.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:90%
I just found my direction.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a wrap,
and I'm in that movie,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and that's 20-some years
ago, the first one.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
about the movie.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It's first
responders, EMTs, firefighters,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and police officers,
who quit under duress,

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:84%
stressful situations of people
being murdered or finding

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:84%
people dead or
just the job itself

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.060 align:middle line:90%
in association to your life.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.054 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just part of that movie.

00:12:15.054 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, you seem so-- well,
you are very sensitive

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:84%
or you wouldn't be
able to do what you do.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you want to be
toting a gun and on the street

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.576 align:middle line:84%
and doing that sort
of thing, really,

00:12:26.576 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:84%
or was it a back door into what
you ultimately ended up doing?

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I don't like
hurting people, toting a gun.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.816 align:middle line:84%
And I know you know,
reference to that.

00:12:39.816 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:90%
It kind of doesn't sit well.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So I still wanted to
be a police officer.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:90%
I want to do what's right.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I want what is right
has to be right.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:90%
And let's face it.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:84%
In any profession there's bad
doctors, there's bad lawyers,

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.040 align:middle line:90%
there's bad police officers.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.670 align:middle line:90%
But I was straightforward.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I remember getting into
an interview one time.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:84%
It was Chief Lunn in Wallaceburg
in a place where actually I

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
helped out in a missing
boy's case not too long ago.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And going back those many
years, he said to me,

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:84%
one day you're going to be
one heck of a police officer.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't make
it that time for him,

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:84%
but yeah, it's just
the drive and wanting

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.292 align:middle line:90%
to help and service.

00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right wrongs.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, right
the wrongs and do right.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So at what point
did you realize you really

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
did have something
special going on

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:84%
with solving these very
difficult cases, particularly

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:90%
homicide?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Take you
back to my first one.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Standing in the parking lot of
an apartment building speaking

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:84%
with a friend of mine, and I
see this gentleman walk maybe 50

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:84%
yards behind him, going
across the parking lot,

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:84%
going into the
apartment building.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.849 align:middle line:90%
I see a black shroud around him.

00:13:56.849 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to ask
more about that in a minute.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Sure.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:90%
And when I see black, it's bad.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's a draw, a strong
draw, because I'm inquisitive.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel it.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And you feel it in here
that there's something

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.480 align:middle line:90%
wrong with that person.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.182 align:middle line:84%
So as Greg's talking to me,
he's noticing my eye movement,

00:14:16.182 --> 00:14:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and he turns over his
shoulder and looks,

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.864 align:middle line:90%
and he goes, oh, that's Jesse.

00:14:19.864 --> 00:14:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, do you
want to go meet him?

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But by that time, he's
already in the building.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.215 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:14:25.215 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So we started to
go up to Jesse--

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just out of curiosity?

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, for
me out of curiosity.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because you don't

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:90%
see black auras that often.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Not too often,
but people who are bad, bad,

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:90%
you do see them.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.815 align:middle line:84%
It's like you can read
people for who they are.

00:14:38.815 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So we ended up
in his apartment building.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't kind of remember how
we got in there, but we did.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And my line of
questioning to him

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.229 align:middle line:84%
was straightforward, more
along the cop line, hard-nosed.

00:14:52.229 --> 00:14:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you could
picture an Eddie Van

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Halen, sawed-off, 5-foot,
perfect image, the same guy,

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:90%
and he was sitting down.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And then he asked me-- and
I remember his girlfriend

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.032 align:middle line:84%
behind him, and I can
see him in my head still.

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:90%
She was pregnant.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:90%
She's pacing back and forth.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.262 align:middle line:90%
And I'm asking questions.

00:15:10.262 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
line of questioning,

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:90%
but I'm asking the questions.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:90%
And he stands up.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:90%
He goes, stand up.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.387 align:middle line:90%
He goes, are you effing hot?

00:15:19.387 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
what he meant.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And then he grabs my
shirt, lifts it up.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Then I knew.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He wanted to
see if you had a wire.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Wire on.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:26.435 --> 00:15:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And once I knew that, and he's
seen I had no wire, he goes,

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:90%
you want to know what happened?

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Mark was a young man
who move from Quebec

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.424 align:middle line:90%
to Ontario with his family.

00:15:38.424 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:90%
He was going to high school.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.548 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who was Mark?

00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Mark is a young man
who was just a high school kid.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, he's
telling you this story?

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.358 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, but he was
the one who was murdered--

00:15:47.358 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, there you go.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: --by this gentleman.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.646 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By this guy.

00:15:50.646 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Jesse you said his name was?

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.804 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Jesse, aka Jesse.

00:15:53.804 --> 00:15:55.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Jesse
had murdered Mark,

00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and now he's going to
tell you what happened.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So he starts explaining Thomas
was his associate with him.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
We're ripping off a car
stereo in the townhouses

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:84%
across the way from
the gas station

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.410 align:middle line:84%
that Mark was working to
make a little cash going

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:90%
to school back then.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
He said Thomas want to
go rob the gas station,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.945 align:middle line:90%
so they left there to go across.

00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:20.403 align:middle line:84%
He said, Thomas
pulled the gun out.

00:16:20.403 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And he held his hand
like this and goes,

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and he was popping
him like this.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:84%
He says, you should have seen
him hopping like a rabbit.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And was laughing.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.720 align:middle line:84%
He was enjoying the moment,
explaining this to me, right?

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So I know
now I'm in thick.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:90%
And he's explaining this to me.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, Greg's kind of
disturbed about this.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:90%
And he leaves.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:90%
I get up to leave.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm leaving,
he grabs my shirt

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:90%
one more time by the door.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:84%
He says if I tell anybody,
he's going to kill me.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:90%
And he shoves me out.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.317 align:middle line:84%
Well, I immediately go home,
and I call the detectives

00:16:56.317 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:90%
in the police force.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And they said, Rob, you have
to go back, wear a wire,

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:90%
and befriend him again.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And I said, there's no way.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:84%
Because he made me-- and there's
no way I'm gonna do this.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So he told me he'd get off on
a technicality and an alibi.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And the prerequisite
of that was he

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.990 align:middle line:84%
did have an alibi from
people out of town,

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:90%
and there was a technicality.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
But I knew right where
he ran and the place

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:90%
that he took off to, and yeah.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.122 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's kind of a
rough entry into all of it.

00:17:30.122 --> 00:17:32.559 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Into the very first
of doing everything, sitting

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:90%
two feet from a murderer, yeah.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so a few
questions arise from that.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
One of them is,
wasn't that a little

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.785 align:middle line:84%
disheartening to you that
you knew this, you saw this,

00:17:42.785 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
the guy was telling
you about it,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.745 align:middle line:84%
yet he gets off
on a technicality?

00:17:45.745 --> 00:17:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.121 align:middle line:84%
It ate me, because I
wanted to be-- again,

00:17:48.121 --> 00:17:49.661 align:middle line:84%
going back to being
a police officer,

00:17:49.661 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:90%
wanting to do the right thing.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.710 align:middle line:84%
It ate me so much
that a gym where

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:84%
used to work out, his
brother used to work there,

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.022 align:middle line:84%
and he would come
over, and he knew

00:18:01.022 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:90%
that I was on to his brother.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.688 align:middle line:84%
And he would talk, and I said,
you know, one your brother's

00:18:04.688 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:90%
going to get it.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.314 align:middle line:84%
And so he'd be not
too kind to me,

00:18:07.314 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not too kind to him.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's that aspect
because I know.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:90%
I knew what was going on.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
happened to the man?

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Jesse.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, Jesse is out
West, apparently, in Canada.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Cook re-murdered,
unfortunately.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Karma is karma.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
a beautiful woman

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:84%
had to die because
of some monster.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.791 align:middle line:84%
He saran wrapped
her, and he watched

00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:33.748 align:middle line:84%
her take her last breath--
because she couldn't

00:18:33.748 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:90%
breathe-- in front of him.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.506 align:middle line:84%
And so now he's
in jail for life.

00:18:37.506 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, at least
he's off the street.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:44.656 align:middle line:84%
And so before we get
into cases and such,

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
having been around these
people, as you said,

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
you see around some people that
really just are sociopathic.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any kind
of empathy for humanity.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:90%
You might see a black aura.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
What else do you see
with people that we

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
consider to be the
toughest cases in society?

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: When you lie-- a
case in Kentucky, two gentlemen

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:84%
were murdered, there's
three parties to this

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and a fourth on
the outside of it.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Since then-- again,
karma is karma.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them have
been killing themselves

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
because they live with
the karma, apparently.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:84%
One individual left on this
case, but the rest of them

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:84%
are all dead-- I keep in
touch with every family,

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.260 align:middle line:84%
so I know what's
going on in that area.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.722 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So suicide
is not uncommon

00:19:36.722 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:84%
because they've
been so devastated.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Their demons get them.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I profiled this individual,
the detective Andy Delay.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:84%
He's in Clearwater,
Florida, now.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And we've got some
cases we're going

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:84%
to be doing down there
with the Sheriff's office.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:90%
He was on this case with me.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, we were in the
hotel meeting room.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we have to
bring this one individual.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:90%
He's our key factor.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:84%
We have to present this
to him in order for him

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:90%
to be a viable witness as well.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:14.930 align:middle line:84%
So I profiled his good side, his
bad side, and what he did it.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:90%
And we put it on Bristol Board.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:90%
We drove over.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:84%
He agreed to meet us at
the end of his driveway.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:90%
We bring out the tape recorder.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm holding the tape recorder.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking to a good
cop-- our good cop, bad cop,

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:90%
doing that scenario.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And he addresses all these
issues with him very toughly.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:90%
He didn't like it.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:90%
So I take over.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I started explaining
certain things to him.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:41.715 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I see you.

00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:90%
I know where you were.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I know what happened,
how the fire was set,

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.554 align:middle line:84%
how you trapped him in there,
how you cut their arms, how

00:20:46.554 --> 00:20:50.337 align:middle line:84%
you cut parts and you hit
them, the whole nine yards.

00:20:50.337 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to get too graphic.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And he's like this, like
you, shaking his head,

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:90%
shaking his head.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So I want the verbal so
I can get it on tape.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:90%
So I continue on.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Andy gets upset, pulls
the Bristol board out.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:84%
This boy couldn't believe
what was on the Bristol board.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And after seeing that, Andy
going through the points,

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.530 align:middle line:84%
and them me talking to
him, he said, yes, yes.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
because you had

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:90%
been able to see these things?

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:16.659 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yes.

00:21:16.659 --> 00:21:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now I want to
talk about the seeing part.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Absolutely.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it comes to
you in a number of ways.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And as you say,
you work-- and we

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:84%
were joking about the beams that
surround you here in studio.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them have a
good sense of humor.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
You have beings
that you're working

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:84%
with that are assisting you
and showing you what you need,

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:90%
and your higher self.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the actual
victim comes to you, too.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, and our
spirit is multi-dimensional.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say and then
think this-- it stays within.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But our spirit is more
than that, all right?

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Many realms.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And we encounter all of it.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Caesar Ivan Cano, a young
boy-- all I was given

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.810 align:middle line:90%
was a photograph.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in Canada,
and he's murdered

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:90%
in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:90%
He's missing.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Can you please help?

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.540 align:middle line:90%
So they sent me a picture.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:90%
All I got was his name, Caesar.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking, and I'm
begging for information.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.095 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to
tap into my guides.

00:22:24.095 --> 00:22:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And I prayed to
God, and I prayed

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to my family, who can help
me, and my guides and angels.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I start to get
certain information.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm writing it down--
repeat offender, two boys.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:90%
So I write that down.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Then I start to ask his spirit
belonging team, spirit guides,

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.090 align:middle line:90%
everything ties to him.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.799 align:middle line:84%
Stadium lights, like off--
and all this is on my website.

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:51.340 align:middle line:84%
You can see my
automatic hand drawing

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.402 align:middle line:90%
on my website about this.

00:22:52.402 --> 00:22:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we
could see the pictures.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So I draw the four
stadium lights, like off.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.462 align:middle line:84%
And apparently that night, they
were off when he went missing.

00:23:03.462 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So there's the four
stadium lights.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:90%
I said, give me a name.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:90%
John.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.175 align:middle line:84%
So by the stadium
lights, I put John.

00:23:09.175 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you stood on the
porch of the murderer's home

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and you looked directly
through the little clearing,

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Papa John Stadium
is right there.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:90%
So I ask, I need more.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Where exactly are you?

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.004 align:middle line:84%
And I see construction,
orange vests.

00:23:25.004 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:84%
They were doing
construction right

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.510 align:middle line:90%
in front of the murderer's home.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And they had the flags, and
they wore the orange vests.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Apparently Caesar was playing
with the flags, pulling them

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
out, ended up in his home,
and that's what happened.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to that
point in a minute.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:90%
I continue on.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:90%
And I say, and show me him.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'm drawing this out of
a four-year-old mindset.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.295 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard
to draw a picture--

00:23:53.295 --> 00:23:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the little
boy is trying to relay this.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Exactly.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.115 align:middle line:90%
I can see here and draw you.

00:23:59.115 --> 00:24:00.115 align:middle line:90%
It would be picturesque.

00:24:00.115 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:90%
It would be a beautiful picture.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.380 align:middle line:84%
But going to him out of
his flashing through me,

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing the man
with the pointy ears,

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm drawing as fast as I
can, because other information

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:90%
is coming in.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a break.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:90%
And then I felt the pull-away.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I knew that
this was him being murdered.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:90%
So I'm upset.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.340 align:middle line:84%
There's about maybe
5, 10 minutes go by.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And there's nothing.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm upset.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm pacing my office, and I'm
going back, and I'm asking,

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:31.640 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I'm back in again.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And now I'm getting it from him.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:90%
I said, give me his name.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:38.790 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:90%
He gave me Cecil.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not a Bob, John, or a Mary.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a Cecil.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And I write "Cecil," and
I put an arrow right down

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.720 align:middle line:84%
to the monster's head
that he made me draw.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So then I continue on, and
there's some other information.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:24:55.690 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:84%
What ended up was poor
Caesar-- I get choked up.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:05.323 align:middle line:84%
Poor Caesar was
drowned in his bathtub.

00:25:05.323 --> 00:25:06.390 align:middle line:90%
And he held him down.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:90%
It's hard when it's a child.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Because I got children.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:90%
We love our children.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.070 align:middle line:90%
And any mom-- and his poor mom.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:25.506 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was the only
one raising him, single mom.

00:25:25.506 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's devastating.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.825 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yup, yup.

00:25:27.825 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I got all
this information,

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and come to learn afterwards, he
was a repeat offender sexually

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:90%
of two young boys.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So that goes back
to tie in to that.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Information went back and forth
in emails between investigator

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.060 align:middle line:84%
in Louisville, Kentucky,
going to the detective

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.425 align:middle line:90%
on the case and myself.

00:25:48.425 --> 00:25:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And I keep every
notation of every case

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.900 align:middle line:90%
I do, emails and what have you.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It went to the news agency,
John Boel, I think it was,

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.500 align:middle line:90%
in Louisville.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So everybody had a piece of
what was really happening

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:84%
momentarily, like right
away from my office.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I still-- and
it's been that long,

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and I still wake up--
what if, what if?

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:84%
What if I would have
done it differently?

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But you can't stop
the inevitable.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.030 align:middle line:90%
I've learned that through God.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.960 align:middle line:90%
You can't stop the inevitable.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.310 align:middle line:90%
You grow from it.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:90%
You mature from it.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And it helps you in
life to progress.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Being this deep into
cases like that,

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:33.930 align:middle line:84%
people wonder how
I want to do this.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of letters from
people, I want to do this.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: You don't.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.346 align:middle line:90%
Just be you.

00:26:41.346 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, how
do people find you?

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously there's
a criminal element,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and the normal
agencies are involved

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:84%
when someone has gone missing
or someone has been killed.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And how do you come
into the picture?

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: A case I'm doing right
now-- there's many of them,

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:90%
but there's a case right now.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:84%
A mother had custody, just
won custody of her child.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.093 align:middle line:84%
This is in-- I'm trying
to think of the state.

00:27:05.093 --> 00:27:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It's Washington-- Seattle.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with the
detective on that.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they know of you?

00:27:12.035 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
a lot of people

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:90%
know of you by now, obviously.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: It's like a 50-50 mix.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I'll get the police
contact me, or they'll

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.960 align:middle line:84%
have the family member, like
yourself, contact me, say,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.407 align:middle line:84%
can you put him
in touch with us?

00:27:24.407 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:90%
And they'll do that.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Or they'll know of me.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
police are pretty open?

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
They're open to using
your types of abilities?

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: There are some, yes.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:90%
And some are skeptics still.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to say, some must still

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.560 align:middle line:84%
have some of the macho
thing, like, hey, there's

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:90%
a way to do this.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Get out of my way.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, and
I don't blame them.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
there's a lot out there

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.030 align:middle line:90%
that's going on that's wrong.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:90%
And I don't blame them.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Case out of Boston--
a friend of mine,

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:90%
he works with the DOE Network.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And his brother's
daughter was murdered.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So he asked me,
and I said, sure.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.993 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'll put you in
touch with the detective.

00:27:55.993 --> 00:27:58.480 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK, fine.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I ain't telling you nothing, and
Tommy's straight-nosed, right?

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.180 align:middle line:90%
I ain't telling you nothing.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.179 align:middle line:84%
I'll just give you a
picture like you always do.

00:28:04.179 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:90%
So fine.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So he gives me a
picture, puts me

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.100 align:middle line:84%
in touch with
Detective Morissette.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:90%
I do my drawings.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:90%
I do all my information.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to the detective
before I fax it to him.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:90%
He goes, well, you know what?

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:90%
And this is true.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:84%
This is how they
speak to anybody.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:84%
If anything touches this
case, I'll contact you back.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.670 align:middle line:90%
If not, don't worry about it.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a brush-off,
Dear John type thing.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.617 align:middle line:90%
So I understand.

00:28:28.617 --> 00:28:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great way to do
it, because they can't just

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.970 align:middle line:84%
approach everybody and take
it for the sake of taking

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.970 align:middle line:90%
information, saying, this is it.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.405 align:middle line:90%
So I sent it to him.

00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting down.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.275 align:middle line:84%
The phone rang about
five minutes later.

00:28:42.275 --> 00:28:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's going, how much
information did they tell you?

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:46.770 align:middle line:90%
I need you to tell me the truth.

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.395 align:middle line:84%
And said, they didn't
tell me anything.

00:28:48.395 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:90%
They just gave me a picture.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And they go, we have
that guy in jail now.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.677 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, it was amazing all
the stuff that tied to him.

00:28:55.677 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying
to tie it to him.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, and I
promised Tommy and his brother

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:84%
that we would have
this completely solved

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.324 align:middle line:84%
before his brother-- his brother
ended up dying of cancer.

00:29:07.324 --> 00:29:07.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:29:07.865 --> 00:29:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, I know.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't
have that satisfaction.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I never give up.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it doesn't matter.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:90%
On some level--

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.248 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: He knows now.

00:29:13.248 --> 00:29:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He knows now, exactly.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:16.830 align:middle line:90%
And you're paying attention.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.174 align:middle line:84%
OK, so before we go on to
some of the other cases,

00:29:19.174 --> 00:29:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to
Seattle in a minute, too.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But most people know about
this through pop culture

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:84%
or shows like "Medium,"
Allison DuBois.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.870 align:middle line:90%


00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about the
reality of that versus what

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.430 align:middle line:90%
we're shown on television, OK?

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.066 align:middle line:84%
I know your face
just went funny.

00:29:43.066 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.596 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the "Medium."

00:29:45.596 --> 00:29:46.137 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK.

00:29:46.137 --> 00:29:50.920 align:middle line:90%


00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I have another show
that's in production.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:58.410 align:middle line:10%
And it's called "The Bar's
Open with Robbie Thomas."

00:29:58.410 --> 00:29:59.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a bar to drink.

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a bar where we discuss
the cases, how I feel,

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.050 align:middle line:84%
what's real with somebody
like myself doing what I do.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Do I just go home, watch
TV, and eat hot dogs?

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Or do psychics really go
and paint their nails?

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So we want to give the real
gist of what really happens.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.180 align:middle line:90%
We use that word "unnerving."

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.290 align:middle line:84%
It's unnerving because what
happens is I do a case,

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't stop.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.590 align:middle line:90%
It affects my whole life.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Thank God for my
wife, because she's

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.610 align:middle line:84%
like the core and the
backbone of who I am.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.515 align:middle line:84%
My children know that
I've taken on cases that

00:30:38.515 --> 00:30:40.640 align:middle line:90%
aren't dangers, and my wife.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And we'll touch upon
that other case.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:43.860 align:middle line:84%
There's many we
could talk about.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.324 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I need that structure.

00:30:48.324 --> 00:30:49.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Family is
what grounds you.

00:30:49.865 --> 00:30:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, it
grounds me big time.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's all females.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've got a bunch
of-- a slew of daughters.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yes.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, females
should run this world.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:58.585 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:30:58.585 --> 00:30:59.610 align:middle line:90%
It's true, really.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:90%
This guy ego stuff--

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet most of the
perps that you're dealing with

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.161 align:middle line:90%
are men.

00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it makes sense that
all the women in your life

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:90%
would balance you back out.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:07.591 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:07.591 --> 00:31:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Because you deal with the trash,
and you come home to the good,

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.200 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.899 align:middle line:84%
But I still reflect to
every case, and it hurts.

00:31:16.899 --> 00:31:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I wake up in the
middle of the night,

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.710 align:middle line:90%
and I'll talk to my wife.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll discuss a case.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.060 align:middle line:90%
She'll listen to me.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.240 align:middle line:90%
And she'll say-- she grounds me.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And just whatever she
tells me directs me.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:90%
It's always right.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Then I ease off a bit.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm OK for a day or two.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.582 align:middle line:84%
Then there's another
case, and I talk about it.

00:31:34.582 --> 00:31:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she's
you're sounding board,

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:38.581 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds like she's
pretty intuitive and grounded.

00:31:38.581 --> 00:31:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Oh, absolutely she is.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, she knows what's going on.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.440 align:middle line:90%
She knows me.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.470 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's good.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.170 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.230 align:middle line:84%
But the good, the bad,
the ugly-- and she said,

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:90%
you've got to talk about this.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.560 align:middle line:90%
And this is from her.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to talk about the
good, the bad, the ugly.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.260 align:middle line:84%
The good is yes,
we get reprieve,

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.820 align:middle line:84%
we get solace sometimes,
and sometimes we

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.360 align:middle line:84%
bring that little
help to the families,

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.390 align:middle line:84%
even if it's not the
proper result in the end,

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.122 align:middle line:90%
but they find out.

00:32:12.122 --> 00:32:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The resolution.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: The resolution, right?

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
The bad about it is if you're
not helping a family enough--

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.320 align:middle line:90%
and I've run into this.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.050 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not saying I'm perfect.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I run into it where if I
don't help them enough or if I

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:33.290 align:middle line:84%
don't-- families want me to
be the counselor, the lawyer,

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.540 align:middle line:84%
the police officer,
everything in between.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they think
you can see everything,

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.373 align:middle line:90%
and they want you to-- yeah.

00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.660 align:middle line:90%
But I'm there to do a job.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And the job is to help you and
to make understanding of what's

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.536 align:middle line:84%
going on so it leads
to this result.

00:32:48.536 --> 00:32:49.660 align:middle line:90%
But that's not good enough.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So then they get upset,
and things happen.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But that is perfectly OK,
because that is the family,

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.910 align:middle line:90%
and you can't blame them.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they want their child
or their husband or their wife

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.640 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And the ugly part
about it is the fact

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that you have all these
people who critique you

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:84%
but they actually are not
on scene, death scene.

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.731 align:middle line:84%
They're not sitting in office
with the detectives, with you.

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:21.980 align:middle line:84%
They're not there where
you're giving the information.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:90%
But they know all.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.270 align:middle line:90%
They see all.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the skeptics,
and I'm not knocking atheists,

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.790 align:middle line:84%
but there are radical
people out there

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.790 align:middle line:84%
who want to just attack
you for no reason at all

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:38.500 align:middle line:90%
because they think they know.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's fine, because
I'm a straight shooter.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't buy into what
they go or anybody--

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.597 align:middle line:84%
as long as I know that the
family and I understand--

00:33:49.597 --> 00:33:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You've done your best.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: I've done my best.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And you see their
letters from them,

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:57.400 align:middle line:84%
saying, thank you for bringing
my daughter home alive.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for helping us out.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.560 align:middle line:84%
We caught this guy who broke
into our home and stuff

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.320 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.764 align:middle line:90%
That's the result we look for.

00:34:05.764 --> 00:34:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: We'll
don't look for this.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
still get the skeptics.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:09.955 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Oh, you do.

00:34:09.955 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned over the
years you just grow with it.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:13.469 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm
occupying their time,

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing something right.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.163 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now we've
kind of beat around the bush.

00:34:19.163 --> 00:34:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to Allison DuBois.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to the "Medium."

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: The "Medium"-- here's
the ugly of it, too, I call it,

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and I put it in that sense, is
that there's so many people out

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.409 align:middle line:90%
there giving disinformation.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.409 align:middle line:84%
They're not discerning
it properly.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:40.239 align:middle line:84%
And the misinformation they get
makes the police and families

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:84%
look down on people who
are really actually doing

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.030 align:middle line:84%
the job, who can go out
there and actually say,

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:90%
the man's name is Cecil.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.439 align:middle line:84%
Or I can get your daughter
out of the sex slave trade,

00:34:51.439 --> 00:34:53.489 align:middle line:90%
and we do within three days.

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:55.389 align:middle line:84%
That's what's the
ugly part about it.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where has DuBois
and the "Medium" come in there?

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Is it that maybe some of
that work wasn't exactly

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.120 align:middle line:90%
the clearest reflection?

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.154 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Looking
at the show, not

00:35:06.154 --> 00:35:07.570 align:middle line:84%
knocking Hollywood,
because we all

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:11.330 align:middle line:84%
love Hollywood and
aspects of how we

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.595 align:middle line:90%
have to drag out things on TV.

00:35:13.595 --> 00:35:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it gave
credibility in a sense to you

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:17.400 align:middle line:90%
and people like you.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Sure, or
other people who do--

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:20.034 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And others
who do this, yeah.

00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to look
at what is real.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.760 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't go and-- as we've
seen on TV, and you look

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and you see this and that--
they have to foreshadow things.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.910 align:middle line:84%
They have to make it
look like it's a resume,

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.330 align:middle line:90%
and this is how it's done.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not done like that.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm on scene, and I know
two men have died there.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know they
cut their arms off.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.170 align:middle line:90%
And they gutted them like deers.

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And they buried them inside
and burned them alive

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.496 align:middle line:90%
while they were still alive.

00:35:57.496 --> 00:36:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing this, and
I'm telling the families.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not a
"Medium" moment.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:07.575 align:middle line:84%
Or it's not a "Ghost Whisperer"
or any other type of show.

00:36:07.575 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not knocking those
shows, because this is good.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.574 align:middle line:84%
People have to learn,
and it's a good aspect.

00:36:11.574 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:84%
But they're being driven
in the wrong direction

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.630 align:middle line:90%
of how it really is.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:19.375 align:middle line:84%
Then you sit in office, and
you pour over information

00:36:19.375 --> 00:36:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that you write out in point
form or whatever I can give

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.420 align:middle line:90%
to the police or the families.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And then they look at that,
and it's more tangible.

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Because now they have something
to lead, to work with.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
they do their job.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:34.789 align:middle line:90%
It's not glorified.

00:36:34.789 --> 00:36:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how long does
it take after something

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:42.020 align:middle line:84%
as grizzly as, say, the
case you just mentioned.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.799 align:middle line:84%
How long does it take before
you can really kind of--

00:36:44.799 --> 00:36:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Download?

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --dissipate all
that energy and those images

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:51.281 align:middle line:90%
from your being?

00:36:51.281 --> 00:36:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a
little, I don't know,

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:56.200 align:middle line:84%
disturbing just to have that
stuff mucking around in there?

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: That's a good word.

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.046 align:middle line:90%
It don't leave you.

00:37:00.046 --> 00:37:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't?

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:01.648 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No, no.

00:37:01.648 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:90%
It don't dissipate.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:07.050 align:middle line:84%
It may get better over time
because you deal with it.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:09.080 align:middle line:90%
And then I know reality.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I sit down.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.940 align:middle line:84%
We watch TV, my
daughters, my wife.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And often my daughters
will ask questions,

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.180 align:middle line:84%
was it like that
on that case, Dad?

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.156 align:middle line:90%
So it just never leaves you.

00:37:19.156 --> 00:37:23.320 align:middle line:84%
You have the reality side
of it in questioning form.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.460 align:middle line:84%
You have your own
demons, if you will,

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.530 align:middle line:84%
that hound you because
of what you've done.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
police officers,

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and they say, I can't
take it anymore,

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.780 align:middle line:84%
or Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's there.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.790 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize
it, but it's there.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:84%
They see these
things all the time.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I do that,
I still see it.

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And so when I go through
it, I pray a lot.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I pray like a
million times a day.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.354 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I have to.

00:37:51.354 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:90%
That's my discernment.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you're
very spiritually oriented.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.954 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Absolutely.

00:37:54.954 --> 00:37:55.610 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.215 align:middle line:90%
That's my way out.

00:37:57.215 --> 00:37:59.590 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have
that, I would think

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I would be a little bit of a
recluse, reckless in my life,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:10.220 align:middle line:84%
a different tangible of a Robbie
than what should be for people.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.670 align:middle line:90%
So I'm people-oriented.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:13.740 align:middle line:90%
I know my focus.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's to continue
to do what I do.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:90%
And that gives me the strength.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we
do a lot of shows

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:23.170 align:middle line:84%
on people who deal with
multidimensional realms

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and people who do angel
readings and all of this.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But we don't usually have
someone who is specifically

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.960 align:middle line:84%
having, for the better good, to
muck around in the dark side.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: If I have
another choice--

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it sounds like you
were kind of called to do this.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't sound like
you're vulnerable to throwing

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.960 align:middle line:84%
in the towel and suicide
like some people are,

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.260 align:middle line:84%
because you have
such a lovely support

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:84%
group in your family
and all these women

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and since you have such a strong
spiritual basis to your life.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.154 align:middle line:90%
You can handle it.

00:38:57.154 --> 00:38:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Although throwing in the towel,
many times I've said, I quit.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.140 align:middle line:90%
God, why?

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.500 align:middle line:84%
But then I start thinking,
Jesus would not give up on me.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So why am I going to
give up on anybody else?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so many
people need your help.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's not them.

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:21.740 align:middle line:90%
I need help and other people.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:90%
I would say we're a family.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.024 align:middle line:90%
We're a team.

00:39:24.024 --> 00:39:25.690 align:middle line:84%
It does take a village
to raise a child.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:32.840 align:middle line:84%
The aspects of growing
and throwing that towel,

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.980 align:middle line:84%
for less of a term, I
mean, I couldn't do it.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.500 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do it,
because if I did,

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm letting down every mom,
dad, or child, grandpa, grandma

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.280 align:middle line:90%
who just want that.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.152 align:middle line:84%
Just give me five
minutes of your time.

00:39:47.152 --> 00:39:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Just give me something.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just help me
understand what happened.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Something, yeah.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so was
it on the Ivan case

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:02.270 align:middle line:84%
that Officer Kevin
Smith made that comment?

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Which case was he referring to?

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:90%
There's a little--

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Clip.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That little
clip on your site.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Which case was he--?

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: It was the
copycat baseline killers.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, copycat
baseline killers.

00:40:11.244 --> 00:40:12.660 align:middle line:84%
First of all, tell
us a little bit

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.770 align:middle line:84%
about that case in
Phoenix, Arizona.

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, it was funny--

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:19.362 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Allison DuBois
country, right? [LAUGHING]

00:40:19.362 --> 00:40:20.362 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Is that right?

00:40:20.362 --> 00:40:20.861 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:40:20.861 --> 00:40:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING]
I'm just putting you on.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.833 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Oh, I'm gonna
take a drink for that one.

00:40:24.833 --> 00:40:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING]

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: OK, I had a radio
show many, many years ago,

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:34.030 align:middle line:90%
2004 to 2008ish, around there.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was out of
Arizona by Baseline.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:90%
And Kevin Smith was in Baseline.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And he's a retired
international police chief.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.540 align:middle line:84%
He was a police
officer in Chicago,

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:49.015 align:middle line:84%
went to Capitol police, and
then they placed him overseas,

00:40:49.015 --> 00:40:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and he became an
international police chief.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So being retired, he had
this radio show, or webisode.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.360 align:middle line:90%
And so I went on it.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And we started talking
about the Baseline Killers.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.359 align:middle line:84%
He says, we're having
a tough time down here.

00:41:07.359 --> 00:41:08.650 align:middle line:90%
And he went through a scenario.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.108 align:middle line:84%
And I started
saying, well, they've

00:41:10.108 --> 00:41:11.955 align:middle line:90%
already talked to the guys.

00:41:11.955 --> 00:41:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I could see them
talking to the guys.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:15.121 align:middle line:90%
And I said, it's a younger guy.

00:41:15.121 --> 00:41:16.280 align:middle line:90%
It's an older guy.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.867 align:middle line:90%
And they're going to go back--

00:41:17.867 --> 00:41:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You did all this
live on the radio show?

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Live.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.084 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:21.084 --> 00:41:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And there's some other
certain information I said.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, he pulled me back
on right away right

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.100 align:middle line:90%
after they arrested them.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.919 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you were on
here, and you said this

00:41:32.919 --> 00:41:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and you said that,
and you said this.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
some nice validation.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:90%
He's a heavyweight.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:40.451 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, he is,
international police chief,

00:41:40.451 --> 00:41:40.950 align:middle line:90%
great guy.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.410 align:middle line:90%
He was straight-nosed.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, rest in
peace, he passed away.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.666 align:middle line:84%
We got done shooting the
pilot to "Psychic Profiler."

00:41:50.666 --> 00:41:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's talk
about that a little bit.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Because the question comes
up, why isn't this guy on TV?

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:84%
There's every other
kind of reality show.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.609 align:middle line:84%
Robbie Thomas should
have his own show.

00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Hm.

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:42:02.425 --> 00:42:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.324 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let's talk about that.

00:42:04.324 --> 00:42:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I was told one time
that real doesn't make it.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What do you mean?

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.400 align:middle line:84%
You mean because reality
shows, it's all fake anyway?

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.810 align:middle line:90%
It's all scripted and fake.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.472 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: It's enlarged.

00:42:16.472 --> 00:42:17.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Enlarged and all that.

00:42:17.805 --> 00:42:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you mean
what you do isn't--

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:20.925 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: It's not glamorous.

00:42:20.925 --> 00:42:22.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
glamorous enough.

00:42:22.425 --> 00:42:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: No, it
doesn't have that bite.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Because like I explained
earlier, it's like I go on,

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.492 align:middle line:84%
I do what I do, I give the
information, and that's it.

00:42:29.492 --> 00:42:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you go home and
have dinner with your family.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Done.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Done.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like getting a
photograph, sitting

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.215 align:middle line:84%
reading the photograph,
Caesar Ivan Cano,

00:42:39.215 --> 00:42:41.590 align:middle line:84%
getting the murderer's name,
sending the information off,

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.835 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:42:42.835 --> 00:42:44.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like you can't do
a TV show like that.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So they want the broad
scheme of things, right?

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:53.395 align:middle line:84%
So we tend to, OK, fine I'm
bending the rules a little bit,

00:42:53.395 --> 00:42:56.560 align:middle line:90%
but I gotta keep it real.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing it in
"America's Most Wanted" type

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.960 align:middle line:84%
fashion, "Cops" type fashion,
Robbie Thomas fashion, which

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.200 align:middle line:84%
means you're going to
be on scene with me.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.666 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
see what I'm doing.

00:43:07.666 --> 00:43:09.290 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
me reading reports.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.330 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see the
police talking to me.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:13.210 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
death scene photographs.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:15.790 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
as much as I see,

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's all going to
be fast-forward, bang

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.356 align:middle line:90%
in your face, and that's it.

00:43:20.356 --> 00:43:22.875 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a good show.

00:43:22.875 --> 00:43:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
I would think so.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that not dramatic enough?

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Not yet?

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:28.206 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No, I guess.

00:43:28.206 --> 00:43:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow. [LAUGHING]
No, instead we're

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.861 align:middle line:84%
enthralled with whoever "The
Bachelor" is going to marry,

00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:35.235 align:middle line:84%
whoever "The
Bachelor" is anyway.

00:43:35.235 --> 00:43:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Or some swamp guys.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or some
swamp guys, oh, my God.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there are
some other-- I want

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.980 align:middle line:84%
to talk a little bit about
these books in a bit,

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.980 align:middle line:84%
but tell us about what happened
in the Victoria Stafford case.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, there's
a beautiful little girl,

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.370 align:middle line:84%
beautiful girls
everywhere and boys.

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:54.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting at home.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
My wife is adjacent
from me watching TV.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.650 align:middle line:90%
And I just get a vision.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's a blond-haired,
beautiful little girl

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:05.795 align:middle line:84%
walking into the tree line
by a huge pile of rocks.

00:44:05.795 --> 00:44:06.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's all I seen.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my
wife, there's gonna

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.830 align:middle line:84%
be another little girl go
missing very, very soon.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.587 align:middle line:90%
And she said, what?

00:44:13.587 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And I started explaining to her.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.880 align:middle line:84%
She goes, oh, no,
hope it's not true.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:22.629 align:middle line:84%
Two days later, eight-year-old
Victoria goes missing.

00:44:22.629 --> 00:44:24.420 align:middle line:84%
It's about an hour and
a half from my home.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.010 align:middle line:90%
It's called Woodstock, Ontario.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Me and the family
get in contact.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I go down and meet them, go
meet the Detective Brown.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:34.344 align:middle line:84%
I'm in office, and
I'm talking to her.

00:44:34.344 --> 00:44:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, did
you reach out to them

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:37.410 align:middle line:84%
because you had
already the vision?

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yes.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you knew
it was going to happen.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I normally don't
reach out to people at all.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.344 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: They always
contact me through my office.

00:44:44.344 --> 00:44:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So I normally don't go, hey--
because it would disprove--

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's people
out there who do that,

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and I called them
back door salesman.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.064 align:middle line:84%
But this one, you had
already had the vision

00:44:55.064 --> 00:44:55.980 align:middle line:90%
of prior to the event.

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: So it all hit.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:04.126 align:middle line:84%
And I profiled a
woman and a man.

00:45:04.126 --> 00:45:06.250 align:middle line:84%
The police said, no, we're
just looking for a woman

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:08.090 align:middle line:90%
because we have her on film.

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And they showed the cameras
on the school, a grainy video,

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:16.442 align:middle line:84%
and it showed a woman leading
Victoria away from the school.

00:45:16.442 --> 00:45:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, you're
looking for a man, too/.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.570 align:middle line:90%
He's the mastermind behind this.

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:23.450 align:middle line:90%
And I profiled him.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out-- I want to
come back into this case,

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.620 align:middle line:84%
but it turns out it was a
man much older than her.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Profile was perfect,
same with the girl.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Go back into the
case with the family,

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.250 align:middle line:84%
they plant me in
the mother's house.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Mother is unbeknownst who
I am, wanting to know.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, OK, why aren't
you looking for your child?

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:51.420 align:middle line:84%
People grieve differently, but
there's not a grieving process

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:54.530 align:middle line:84%
here, because she's just
missing at the time, right?

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Not once going out.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a parent,
you're pounding the floor.

00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: You're
going out there.

00:45:59.370 --> 00:45:59.995 align:middle line:90%
You're looking.

00:45:59.995 --> 00:46:01.345 align:middle line:90%
You're tearing everything up.

00:46:01.345 --> 00:46:03.729 align:middle line:90%


00:46:03.729 --> 00:46:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I gotta catch myself,
because there's still

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.790 align:middle line:90%
more part of this case.

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:08.957 align:middle line:90%
But I just want to continue.

00:46:08.957 --> 00:46:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I know you can understand
where I'm going on this.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.545 align:middle line:90%
There's part open still.

00:46:12.545 --> 00:46:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The case
is still open?

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Well, there's
part of it that's--

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A part
of it's still open?

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:16.399 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:16.399 --> 00:46:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So get the
man, girl pleads guilty,

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.890 align:middle line:90%
man found guilty.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:25.710 align:middle line:90%
They're off to jail.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And the funny twist to this,
the man who put McCafferty

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:34.120 align:middle line:84%
in the car, the detective had
him arrested and arrested him,

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.530 align:middle line:84%
my aunt calls me up-- my
uncle died years ago--

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and she says to me-- she's
not dated for years--

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.910 align:middle line:84%
she goes, you just ain't
gonna believe who I'm dating.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:43.700 align:middle line:90%
And I said, who?

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.990 align:middle line:84%
She goes, you know
that case you worked?

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, my gosh,
are you kidding me?

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All in the family.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: All in
the family, right?

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:49.996 align:middle line:90%
Keep it in the family.

00:46:49.996 --> 00:46:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But going back to your
question about that,

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.890 align:middle line:84%
when I drew the drawings, the
pile of rocks, the tree line,

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen wagon wheels,
tons of wagon wheels.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to discern
all this information quick,

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.687 align:middle line:90%
so I draw it all out.

00:47:08.687 --> 00:47:10.145 align:middle line:84%
And we went hunting
for her, right?

00:47:10.145 --> 00:47:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And we found this one home, and
it was full of wagon wheels.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
that's where she is!

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.176 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, I don't know.

00:47:15.176 --> 00:47:16.366 align:middle line:90%
Just hang tough.

00:47:16.366 --> 00:47:18.990 align:middle line:84%
But they went in right away, the
police went right in the door,

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't where she was.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Here's the tree line.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Here's the pile of rocks.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:26.620 align:middle line:90%
There's a laneway.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.616 align:middle line:84%
Down that laneway is
a Mennonite village.

00:47:28.616 --> 00:47:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wagon wheels.

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Wagon wheels,
horse-drawn buggies--

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:32.480 align:middle line:90%
what I drew.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And her body
was found right there

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.070 align:middle line:90%
by the pile of rocks.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And see, it
wouldn't make sense

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.300 align:middle line:84%
unless somebody put that piece
together, that's for sure.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right, right.

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:43.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about this
piece about the mother who

00:47:43.203 --> 00:47:44.340 align:middle line:90%
wasn't in mourning?

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, I just
find that kind of strange.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.445 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, to say the least.

00:47:50.445 --> 00:47:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
there, and I'm trying

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.530 align:middle line:84%
to get a read on her and
her boyfriend in the home.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at kids
coming out of the living room,

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and they've got beer
bottles in their hands,

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're like
13, 14 years of age.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, I know it's a tough time,
but strange things, right?

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:10.228 align:middle line:90%
Strange.

00:48:10.228 --> 00:48:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I've been in a lot
of strange places

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and seen a lot of
strange things.

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that part
is maybe still open?

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
gotcha on that one.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.200 align:middle line:84%
All right, we don't
need to go there.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:20.741 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No.

00:48:20.741 --> 00:48:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, the Brewer family.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:22.704 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:48:22.704 --> 00:48:25.799 align:middle line:84%
Oh, one more thing about
the Victoria Stafford case.

00:48:25.799 --> 00:48:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Like I told you, I do automatic
hand drawing, and it's there.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.544 align:middle line:90%
I put "Gulch."

00:48:29.544 --> 00:48:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gulch?

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:30.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Gulch, right.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.073 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, gulch.

00:48:32.073 --> 00:48:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And I kept telling
the family, gulch.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.076 align:middle line:84%
But they found her
body near Guelph.

00:48:36.076 --> 00:48:38.522 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
Guelph-- interesting.

00:48:38.522 --> 00:48:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Interesting, right?

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
perception, and it's fast,

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:42.875 align:middle line:90%
and you gotta put it down.

00:48:42.875 --> 00:48:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
fascinated with this.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And as I said in the open of
the show, about 30 years ago

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:52.180 align:middle line:84%
when I was a news anchor,
when we had sweeps week,

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.150 align:middle line:84%
the ratings, they kind of
let me do what I wanted.

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:57.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey, go find
something fun to do.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:59.299 align:middle line:84%
Go do a special with
some kind of ratings.

00:48:59.299 --> 00:49:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was always
drawn to things that

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.770 align:middle line:90%
were metaphysically oriented.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I put up that
one week, as I was saying.

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And I became friends
with the woman

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:13.000 align:middle line:84%
who was the psychic at
the police department

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.470 align:middle line:90%
in a few different cities.

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:17.330 align:middle line:84%
At this time Sacramento was
using her for their cases

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.340 align:middle line:90%
as well, and she was very good.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And I found along the way
that with myself, I've

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.440 align:middle line:84%
always kind of dipped
into this and that.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's like if there's
space and quiet and time,

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:31.840 align:middle line:84%
try my hand at whatever the
modality of awareness was.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.330 align:middle line:90%
And usually it would work.

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And I found one thing, and that
was speaking to people right

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:42.010 align:middle line:84%
after they die, within like
a three- to five-day window,

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:43.730 align:middle line:90%
was pretty easy.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And speaking to people within
a week before they're born

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.600 align:middle line:90%
is pretty easy.

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.299 align:middle line:84%
So you can talk to the
entity, and they can tell you

00:49:52.299 --> 00:49:53.840 align:middle line:84%
kind of what they're
coming here for,

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.750 align:middle line:84%
what their likes, dislikes,
which parent they're associated

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:59.160 align:middle line:84%
more with, where their
karma is, or maybe

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.824 align:middle line:84%
even they tell me things
like, I'm really just

00:50:01.824 --> 00:50:02.490 align:middle line:90%
here for my mom.

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:06.570 align:middle line:84%
My dad's gonna leave before
I'm one, things like that.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:08.120 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's
so interesting

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.890 align:middle line:84%
to note that the
entity coming in

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:12.489 align:middle line:84%
is fully aware what
the dynamics are.

00:50:12.489 --> 00:50:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Oh, sure.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's no
big shock or surprise.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No.

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wouldn't tell the
mother that kind of thing,

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:17.550 align:middle line:90%
certainly.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But also right after
they die, but there's

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.270 align:middle line:84%
a point at which some
entities don't stick around.

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: No.

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They go.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.630 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about that.

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Sure, sure.

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Coming around many times
in many lives and living,

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:33.560 align:middle line:84%
reincarnation, when I was a
child, I used to say to my mom,

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.512 align:middle line:90%
I'm reincarnated.

00:50:34.512 --> 00:50:35.470 align:middle line:90%
She said, well, really?

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:37.240 align:middle line:90%
She wanted to know why and how.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So I would explain, I
lived with my father.

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.540 align:middle line:90%
He was a single dad.

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And I remember vividly
what he looked like.

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, all I see
is myself hovering

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:47.930 align:middle line:84%
above him in the kitchen,
him very distraught.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And so then I said,
then I'm out in a road,

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and I remember him
waving to me goodbye.

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:53.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to school.

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:54.340 align:middle line:90%
And I'm waving.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And this was in the
'60s, Mom, early '60s.

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Our window of reception in
incarnates is immediate.

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:07.910 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a short
window of a few years,

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:10.570 align:middle line:90%
could be a minute in heaven.

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:12.590 align:middle line:90%
You reincarnate quick.

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:13.960 align:middle line:90%
So I'm waving.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.000 align:middle line:90%
I get hit by a car.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.480 align:middle line:90%
That's what I know.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.820 align:middle line:90%
So I pass.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:18.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm born again.

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, here's this two- and
three-year-old, four-year-old

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:21.970 align:middle line:90%
kid telling your mother.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
key age, by the way.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:23.714 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yes, it is.

00:51:23.714 --> 00:51:24.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's a draw.

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the closer you are to
your incarnate, that period

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:32.770 align:middle line:84%
of time, that pinnacle
moment of your death,

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:34.420 align:middle line:90%
it's a stronger draw.

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.422 align:middle line:84%
So if you're 20 years
old, you pass at 20,

00:51:36.422 --> 00:51:38.880 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden this is going
to come rushing into you just

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.080 align:middle line:90%
prior to and just after.

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's that window you're
talking about coming and going.

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:44.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, and my son even did that.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I remember one time
when he was about three

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and a half, that same
age group, and I'm

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:52.155 align:middle line:84%
talking to him about
something one day,

00:51:52.155 --> 00:51:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and I said, honey, I said,
I'm just a little sad tonight,

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.614 align:middle line:84%
and so continue
building your fort.

00:51:58.614 --> 00:52:01.030 align:middle line:84%
He was building a fort in the
living with all the pillows.

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And his father and
I had just split up.

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but
there was a time--

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:08.460 align:middle line:90%
I was speaking of a past life.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:11.112 align:middle line:84%
I said, there was a time when
I don't think I treated you

00:52:11.112 --> 00:52:12.820 align:middle line:84%
as well as I could
have, and I don't ever

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.280 align:middle line:84%
want that to happen
to you again.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.715 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
saying that to him.

00:52:15.715 --> 00:52:17.090 align:middle line:84%
He kept building
his little fort.

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:18.590 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, that's OK, Mom.

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:20.260 align:middle line:90%
I did it to you, too.

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:21.110 align:middle line:90%
And I said, pardon?

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right, right.

00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he used to tell
me about a past life in England.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know
any of this stuff.

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:28.640 align:middle line:90%
He'd never heard of England.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.000 align:middle line:84%
He tells me in great
detail everything

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.900 align:middle line:84%
going on in the family, who
I was, what he had done,

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:36.009 align:middle line:90%
and so forth-- totally open.

00:52:36.009 --> 00:52:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Oh, yeah.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.008 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At this little
age, if we don't squash them

00:52:39.008 --> 00:52:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, quit
making things up,

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:42.500 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot that
can be revealed

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:43.620 align:middle line:90%
from these little beings.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Oh, absolutely.

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
your own daughters?

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, I talk
to them all the time,

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:47.323 align:middle line:90%
very open with them.

00:52:47.323 --> 00:52:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I used to have forums
in the mid '90s

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:55.760 align:middle line:84%
to late '90s, which we can
talk about a case from this.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.590 align:middle line:90%
This lady called me up.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I followed
you since the mid '90s.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.979 align:middle line:90%
And it was Robbie Thomas Forums.

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Because on the
forums, there was talk

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.020 align:middle line:84%
about reincarnation,
spirituality, and really deep,

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.197 align:middle line:90%
deep topics.

00:53:09.197 --> 00:53:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I thought
I'd never have to use you,

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.140 align:middle line:84%
but my daughter's been taken
to the sex slave trade.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But going back now-- we'll
go into that in a second.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:24.200 align:middle line:84%
But going back to the relevance
of reincarnation and this part,

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.630 align:middle line:84%
talking to my
daughters about it,

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and I used to teach
parents to open a journal,

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:33.400 align:middle line:84%
write everything specific from
the child, but don't elaborate

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.790 align:middle line:90%
and don't take away.

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:37.395 align:middle line:84%
Because then when they get
older, they can reflect to that

00:53:37.395 --> 00:53:38.722 align:middle line:90%
and say, that's me.

00:53:38.722 --> 00:53:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's great.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.929 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And that's the way
you're supposed to do it.

00:53:41.929 --> 00:53:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is great.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about the woman
and her daughter and the sex

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:46.981 align:middle line:90%
slave trade.

00:53:46.981 --> 00:53:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, there's
that thing, right?

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We just
have a few minutes

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:51.136 align:middle line:84%
on that before I want
to get your books,

00:53:51.136 --> 00:53:53.430 align:middle line:84%
because we're
really cooking here.

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK, all right.

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:58.325 align:middle line:84%
So she says, I never
thought I'd have to use you.

00:53:58.325 --> 00:53:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And she says, my
daughter's been taken.

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The detective is lost,
doesn't know what to do.

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:04.200 align:middle line:90%
And he asked me to call.

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So then again, here's that
police-family orientation type

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:07.490 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:09.196 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK, fine.

00:54:09.196 --> 00:54:10.320 align:middle line:90%
So I give her a quick read.

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, you've
got to do what I say you

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:16.160 align:middle line:90%
have to do, like regardless.

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.710 align:middle line:90%
So I tell her.

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I said, on your Facebook
page, they're watching you.

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:24.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to put
words I tell you.

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And she says, my
family's conservative.

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.910 align:middle line:90%
I am not going to do this.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:30.850 align:middle line:84%
We went through a
battery of phone calls,

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:36.350 align:middle line:84%
because she's so defiant, the
moment of doing that, and then

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:38.525 align:middle line:90%
being defiant, would hang up.

00:54:38.525 --> 00:54:40.650 align:middle line:84%
All right, and finally, I
think was Friday morning.

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:42.290 align:middle line:90%
She says, I'm going to do it.

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
my family thinks.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:44.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I want-- I said, that's
what you're supposed to do.

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:47.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did you
have her put on there?

00:54:47.815 --> 00:54:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: I said,
her daughter's name,

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I know you're
watching this page.

00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:57.045 align:middle line:84%
Please let her go, and there
will be no prosecution,

00:54:57.045 --> 00:55:00.440 align:middle line:90%
and yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Because now she's opening
up to her whole family

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.330 align:middle line:84%
watching this on
her Facebook page

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.900 align:middle line:90%
and her friends and everybody.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: She did.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.441 align:middle line:90%
She did it.

00:55:09.441 --> 00:55:10.066 align:middle line:90%
And she called.

00:55:10.066 --> 00:55:11.055 align:middle line:90%
She was crying.

00:55:11.055 --> 00:55:11.680 align:middle line:90%
She was crying.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.080 align:middle line:90%
And I'm talking to her.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:13.580 align:middle line:90%
She did it.

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.520 align:middle line:90%


00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.180 align:middle line:90%
This is Friday.

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Sunday rolls around, and
her daughter was home.

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:22.840 align:middle line:90%
They were watching her.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.807 align:middle line:90%
She writes this letter.

00:55:24.807 --> 00:55:25.390 align:middle line:90%
She called me.

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:27.056 align:middle line:84%
We talked for like
an hour on the phone,

00:55:27.056 --> 00:55:28.841 align:middle line:84%
and she's crying and
happy and everything.

00:55:28.841 --> 00:55:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How did that happen?

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:31.651 align:middle line:84%
How did that one
message on Facebook

00:55:31.651 --> 00:55:32.650 align:middle line:90%
result in her daughter--

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:34.775 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Because we know
that we're watching them.

00:55:34.775 --> 00:55:35.663 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:55:35.663 --> 00:55:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right?

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we know who you are.

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We know who you are.

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:39.446 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right.

00:55:39.446 --> 00:55:42.620 align:middle line:90%
So they let her go.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:43.890 align:middle line:90%
She writes a letter.

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:45.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's on my page.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And she says-- I can't
remember all the words,

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.650 align:middle line:90%
but it says, thank you.

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:55.780 align:middle line:84%
He brought my daughter home,
and in capital letters, ALIVE.

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
we didn't go back

00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:58.810 align:middle line:90%
to the story out of Seattle.

00:55:58.810 --> 00:55:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right, right.

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, let's do that.

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.221 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK.

00:56:01.221 --> 00:56:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm currently working a case
out of Seattle, Washington.

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it gets
very tough when

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:09.930 align:middle line:84%
you have parents who don't
put the perspective of a child

00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:11.339 align:middle line:90%
at best interest.

00:56:11.339 --> 00:56:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I used to be-- now this is
something different for you,

00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:14.130 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I used to be vice president
of an organization who

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:21.540 align:middle line:84%
worked with 26
senators trying to pass

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.300 align:middle line:84%
the bill the Rights
of the Child,

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and putting mom and
dad at a lesser value,

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:30.770 align:middle line:84%
but making them treat
the child respectfully.

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:32.875 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
Rights of the Child.

00:56:32.875 --> 00:56:36.470 align:middle line:84%
It was amazing, because we had
women on board, Senator Anne

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Cools, many different senators.

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And so going back to the case,
when you get mom and dad,

00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and they fight over the
custody of a child, it's hard.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So this beautiful woman
won custody of her child.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And the father took
the child and has now

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:54.960 align:middle line:90%
taken off underground.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm working with the case
in Seattle with the detective.

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully we can render
something positive very soon

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:04.022 align:middle line:90%
for mom, for the child.

00:57:04.022 --> 00:57:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The child
is still alive?

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yes.

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
see they're alive?

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: They've been notified.

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.129 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:09.129 --> 00:57:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: And I can feel.

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:16.960 align:middle line:84%
The child is fine, which is
a plus in what's going on.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I really think that parents
should come together more often

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and put their egos and
everything else behind,

00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:24.543 align:middle line:90%
put children first.

00:57:24.543 --> 00:57:26.292 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
you're doing it for.

00:57:26.292 --> 00:57:27.166 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, yeah.

00:57:27.166 --> 00:57:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
before we sign off,

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.739 align:middle line:84%
you have a couple books here--
"Paranormal Encounters."

00:57:31.739 --> 00:57:33.155 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And
"Signs from Heaven."

00:57:33.155 --> 00:57:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Signs from Heaven."

00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:36.494 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about both
of them and why you wrote them.

00:57:36.494 --> 00:57:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's some really
interesting images in here,

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:40.030 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:42.460 align:middle line:84%
You catch amazing
things on digital film.

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:45.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, last night at the
Boulderado Hotel-- everyone

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.790 align:middle line:84%
knows it's haunted--
you got a full-on shadow

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:52.120 align:middle line:84%
person, a man, full-on man
walking down the stairs

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:52.970 align:middle line:90%
who wasn't there.

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: It wasn't there.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.460 align:middle line:84%
He's standing down in
the lobby looking up.

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is not abstract.

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:57.790 align:middle line:84%
It just looks like
a man from behind.

00:57:57.790 --> 00:57:58.681 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:57:58.681 --> 00:57:59.680 align:middle line:90%
And everything's lit up.

00:57:59.680 --> 00:57:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:00.170 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: And this crazy
black, you can look.

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just tell us really
briefly about these two books.

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:05.411 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: OK.

00:58:05.411 --> 00:58:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Signs from heaven
is an assurance

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.374 align:middle line:84%
of us and the other side, giving
you hope, love, and faith.

00:58:10.374 --> 00:58:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the cover
here is for my wife.

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:15.085 align:middle line:84%
She made me do the stones,
and we went to the beach.

00:58:15.085 --> 00:58:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And see the water, how it--

00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:17.172 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:17.172 --> 00:58:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: That's the love
of God coming on you.

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.205 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:58:20.205 --> 00:58:22.396 align:middle line:84%
So it was perfect
and perfect meaning.

00:58:22.396 --> 00:58:27.030 align:middle line:84%
It's endorsed by the Canadian
government, which is-- yeah.

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
interesting, but--

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Psychic, you know?

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.581 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:31.581 --> 00:58:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.788 align:middle line:84%
We thought the Canucks
were conservative.

00:58:33.788 --> 00:58:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Guess not.

00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Guess not.

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our government
wouldn't do that for you.

00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.181 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: We play hockey.

00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:38.262 align:middle line:90%
We have back bacon, and--

00:58:38.262 --> 00:58:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] And
they endorse your book.

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.183 align:middle line:90%
That happened.

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:40.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:41.472 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:58:41.472 --> 00:58:42.930 align:middle line:84%
What about "Paranormal
Encounters?"

00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:45.040 align:middle line:10%
>>THOMAS: "Paranormal
Encounters," again there's

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.200 align:middle line:10%
two movies I'm in
that are in there,

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.574 align:middle line:10%
behind the scenes,
what happened,

00:58:47.574 --> 00:58:50.370 align:middle line:10%
what was brought home,
different-- people

00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:53.580 align:middle line:10%
call them entities, but they're
people on the other side.

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.540 align:middle line:10%
They want information
and what have you.

00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.770 align:middle line:10%
Again, there's many places
throughout North America

00:58:58.770 --> 00:58:59.720 align:middle line:10%
I've traveled.

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.553 align:middle line:10%
There's stories in there
that are fantastic.

00:59:01.553 --> 00:59:04.160 align:middle line:84%
There's photographs in
there that are fantastic,

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Civil War soldier
who was following--

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and you can see his belt
line, his hat, and his head.

00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:10.880 align:middle line:90%
He's facing me.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's in Perryfield
Battlefield.

00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:13.790 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:15.730 align:middle line:84%
4,000 men buried
two-feet deep there.

00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And the battlefield
is very short.

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, crazy.

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, crazy.

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, beautiful
work, and I just want

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.175 align:middle line:84%
to thank you for taking
the time to fly in

00:59:23.175 --> 00:59:24.300 align:middle line:90%
from Canada to do the show.

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Thank
you for having me.

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:25.745 align:middle line:90%
This was great.

00:59:25.745 --> 00:59:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I
just felt really touched

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.110 align:middle line:90%
by what Jerry said about you.

00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:31.818 align:middle line:84%
And the first time we
spoke on the phone,

00:59:31.818 --> 00:59:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what a
sweet man to have

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:36.720 align:middle line:90%
to deal with such harsh stuff.

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, I'll
be curious to see

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:42.119 align:middle line:84%
what happens by
way of your media

00:59:42.119 --> 00:59:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and so forth beyond all
of the work you're doing.

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd like for a lot
of people to know about you.

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Oh, thank you.

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:49.275 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, in
fact, it's sad,

00:59:49.275 --> 00:59:50.900 align:middle line:84%
but there are some
people listening who

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.020 align:middle line:90%
may need to call you one day.

00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: Yeah, and
that's unfortunate.

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:55.327 align:middle line:90%
OK, thanks so much, Robbie.

00:59:55.327 --> 00:59:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Well, thank you.

00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:57.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: If you
know of anyone who

00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.670 align:middle line:10%
is in the terrible
circumstance of not knowing

00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:01.240 align:middle line:10%
what happened to
a loved one, you

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.410 align:middle line:10%
can always contact Robbie
at RobbieThomas.net.

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thanks for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
