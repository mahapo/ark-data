00:00:05.354 --> 00:00:07.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Among
the many divination systems

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.730 align:middle line:10%
available to us in our life to
help us navigate through it,

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.310 align:middle line:10%
we came across a really profound
one called the Gene Keys.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Its originator is
Richard Rudd, who

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.434 align:middle line:84%
is both a mystic and
gifted with this knowledge.

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:23.913 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:42.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for a meeting
with us in London.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I know you had to hoof it
little bit to get here,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and you've just
caught your breath.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And just for the
sake of the viewers,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
we're right on the
flight path to Heathrow,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.100 align:middle line:84%
so we'll be hearing a lot
of ambient sound of the city

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:90%
while we're doing this, so.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, once you know about
it, you just forget about it.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So I have a couple things I
want to get into first off.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Which is a lot of people in
the circle of people I know,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:90%
know about Human Design.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Not as many are familiar yet
with the Gene Keys, which

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.900 align:middle line:84%
is really interesting, because
it's a really refined, kind

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:84%
of stepped up
version, in a sense.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So tell us how the Gene
Keys came about first.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD RUDD: Yeah.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, I started off being
a student of Human Design.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:10%
And for many years I studied
with the founder, Ra,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:10%
and he was very
kind enough to allow

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:10%
me to take Human
Design into the UK.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So I became the first person
to bring it over here.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And I trained as a teacher
and got very into it.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was always
this small part of me

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:90%
that was uncomfortable with it.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I was uncomfortable
with some of the terms.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:84%
I felt a kind of
limitation, like I

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
was a little bit boxed in.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But I continued my research
for about seven years or so.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And seven years is a bit of
a number in Human Design.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a cellular imprinting.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And right towards the end
of my seven year cycle,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I had a series of awakenings,
I suppose you could call them.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:90%
One big one.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can we talk
about one big one?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Is that the St. Benedict's
eye story, or a different one.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: A different one.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
both then, because I

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.118 align:middle line:90%
found that interesting.

00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: This one was-- I've had
two big awakenings in my life.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
One was back in
1996, the first one.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And the second one was, as I was
evolving through Human Design,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:90%
it was in 2004.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually on
the way to a course

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.320 align:middle line:90%
where I was innovating.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:90%
It was called, The 64 Gifts.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'd taken the
I Ching hexagrams,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to make them
very approachable for people.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, what are
the gifts in these gates?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
In Human Design, he
calls them gates.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, what are the
gifts in this matrix?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I had these
64 words, and I

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
was teaching-- I was
on my way to Newcastle

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.295 align:middle line:90%
to teach this course.

00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:08.975 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting with a
friend of mine, Vernor Pitsau,

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:90%
from Austria.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:90%
He's a psychotherapist.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And we had this
breakthrough on the train.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, you know,
these gifts have shadows.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
know, you're right.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.960 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.626 align:middle line:84%
And we spent the rest
of the three hours

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
on the journey pinpointing
and naming the shadows.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was with an
expert in shadow,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
because he's 30 years
a psychotherapist.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.246 align:middle line:84%
So we really nailed
down these patterns.

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And we got to Newcastle,
and I thought, well,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:84%
what are we going
to do with all that?

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And then that night, a
whole other level opened up,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.052 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote down the
higher key notes,

00:03:42.052 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:90%
which I call now the siddhis.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:90%
It's the full siddhi.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it
almost as though you

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.587 align:middle line:90%
were having a download of sorts?

00:03:46.587 --> 00:03:47.295 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Oh, yeah.

00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:47.844 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was much easier
than the shadows,

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.770 align:middle line:84%
which took a lot of
kind of hard work.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:90%
These just came in a stream.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And I never changed them,
because they came out perfect,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
whereas the shadows, I had
to adjust and work through,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and some of them
needed changing.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that wasn't my
mystical experience.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.525 align:middle line:84%
But it came after that,
when I had this matrix.

00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
There was suddenly
a whole new matrix.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I went into a
spontaneous awakened state,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:84%
where I-- it's hard to
explain such a state--

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
but I saw a lot of
things, and I transcended

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.310 align:middle line:90%
this old model of Human Design.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that humanity
was going to transcend.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that that
model was a transitory model.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.795 align:middle line:84%
And so it was, in
a way, unfinished.

00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a whole
stream of information--

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I actually had access to
it-- that was left out

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
of the original Human
Design revelation.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And so that then
became my mission,

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.240 align:middle line:84%
to complete that transmission
that started in 1987.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was very clear to
me that that was my role.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:84%
I saw that very, very
clear in that space.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
you were looking

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle line:90%
for more dimension, as you say.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Because Human Design can
be interpreted, of course,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
ability of the person

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
interpreting it, to a
number of different depths.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But it does tend to be a little
less deep in its dimension,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:84%
certainly, than what
the Gene Keys offers.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.269 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even if you're trying
to give a self reading.

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's quite interesting.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:84%
You have the tools to do
that in the Gene Keys,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have so
much with Human Design.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you something
to lay a foundation here.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So in Human Design, you
have the classic typology.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And the population is split
into these typologies.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Can just that foundation
for us a moment before we

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:90%
move into what you've done?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Sure.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Human Design
breaks down, as you

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:84%
said, human beings into types
and profiles, they're called.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So that you have four
different broad types.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
the mechanical--

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.882 align:middle line:84%
they describe the mechanical
functioning of human beings.

00:06:01.882 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:90%
That's really it.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.131 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
mechanical functioning.

00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
useful in and of itself

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:84%
if you're not aware
of that in yourself.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Absolutely.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:90%
It was very useful for me.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:12.364 align:middle line:90%
What are you?

00:06:12.364 --> 00:06:13.655 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: I'm the Generator Type.

00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:84%
See, I don't like
these terms, even.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.414 align:middle line:84%
It makes me sound
like a machine.

00:06:16.414 --> 00:06:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But we're just talking
the basic mechanics

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.910 align:middle line:90%
that you have built upon.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Absolutely.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:90%
A Generator Type.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And list-- I would just like to
characterize those four types.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a Projector Type.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what these things mean,

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.002 align:middle line:84%
and then that that's
mechanical, functional, and then

00:06:33.002 --> 00:06:33.960 align:middle line:90%
we're going to move on.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.342 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, fine.

00:06:35.342 --> 00:06:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It's been a while since
I've done Human Design.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:90%
So it's not fresh in me.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.340 align:middle line:90%
The Manifestor Type.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:90%
That's 8% of humanity.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.754 align:middle line:84%
The Generator Type, there are
two variations of Generators.

00:06:46.754 --> 00:06:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Manifesting Generator
and Generator.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.786 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Exactly.

00:06:49.786 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're 70%
approximately, of humanity.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.660 align:middle line:90%
And then Projectors.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:90%
I think they're about 20%.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And then 1%--

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is Reflector?

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Or 2%, Reflectors, yeah.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that that's
an interesting blank slate.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It's almost like
a person in that category,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
if anyone has done Human
Design, watching this,

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.297 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like just a mirror
walking around for everything

00:07:15.297 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:90%
else surrounding it.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.329 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yes, absolutely.

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is fascinating.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's get to
the-- if you don't

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:84%
mind sharing the St. Benedict's
eye story, because I liked it.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: It was just-- it felt
like an appropriate place

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:90%
to begin my book.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm a poet and a storyteller,
and I love stories.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So it actually wasn't
a massive experience.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:84%
It was just a really nice
story of me meditating

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
in this grotto in Italy,
where St. Benedict slept.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.565 align:middle line:90%
And I was in there early.

00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:51.690 align:middle line:90%
I'd got to the place early.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I was actually travelling
through Italy with my parents

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.582 align:middle line:84%
at the time, to visit the
cemetery where my uncle was

00:07:58.582 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:84%
killed during the
second world war.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.373 align:middle line:90%
So it was a really nice journey.

00:08:01.373 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It was a sort of
ancestral journey.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And I kept peeling off to
go to these sacred places,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and this was one of them,
up in the mountains.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I was allowed in early,
before any of the tourists

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:90%
got there.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I had two or three
hours alone in the grotto.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I was lying there,
where he had his head,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:84%
there's this famous--
because there's

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
this kind of pillow in the
rock where he supposedly laid

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.480 align:middle line:90%
his head and slept.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I put my head
there, and I laid there

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:90%
for about three hours.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:90%
And he had this great vision.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
He was down there for years,
just being lowered food.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And then he came out with
this incredible vision

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that became the
Benedictine movement.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Because he saw
these 12 churches.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, he saw this
vision of the new Jerusalem,

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:56.035 align:middle line:84%
and then he replicated it on
the material plane, as he saw.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But I was lying
down there, and I

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:84%
saw this pair of eyes,
very, very bright eyes,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:90%
in this moment.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
It just was a shock
to me, in a way.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were eyes just brimming
with certainty and truth.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's not often you
see eyes like that.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.630 align:middle line:90%
But there was no doubt in them.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:90%
There was no shadow.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.190 align:middle line:84%
There was just only
light and truth.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the St.
Benedict's eyes story,

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's symbolic,
in a way, of you know,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:84%
what happened to him
can happen to anyone.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
inside all of us.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:31.233 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:32.921 align:middle line:84%
That clarity and
that awakened state.

00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: That light, yes.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how did
the-- you mention briefly,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:84%
but you don't go into it in
the book, the Great White

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Brotherhood factor into this
whole system, the download.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:90%
What is the story behind it?

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you didn't say
much about it in the book,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:90%
and it caught my attention.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Did it?

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Interesting.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.758 align:middle line:84%
When you say the Great
White Brotherhood,

00:09:55.758 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:84%
do you mean the celestial
one or the actual manifest--

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.762 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whichever one you
were talking about in the book.

00:10:03.762 --> 00:10:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Well, there are
two-- there are levels.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I understand.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.205 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Funnily
enough, I've just

00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
come back from Bulgaria,
where the actual Great White

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Brotherhood, in the form,
gather in the mountains

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:90%
and do their paneurhythmy dance.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're the most incredible
people I've ever met.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.975 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they stand
out in a crowd.

00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Any time you see one of
them, there's just no doubt

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.370 align:middle line:84%
that this is a member
of the Brotherhood,

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:84%
because they have this sheen and
this innocence in their eyes,

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:90%
and this beauty about them.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
striking to me.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:42.165 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that came about because
I have a very deep connection

00:10:42.165 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
in me with this teacher called
Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov, who

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.461 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned in the
credits in my book.

00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you didn't go
into depth in any of this,

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and I was just curious
about this link.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Well, his
teaching and the teaching

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of the master that came before
him, Peter Deunov, who's

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:90%
the man from Bulgaria.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.835 align:middle line:84%
They brought this incredible
teaching-- Christ teaching,

00:11:05.835 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:84%
in a way-- that integrates east
and western concepts, quite

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:84%
complex concepts, and Kabbalah
and all kinds of things.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:22.197 align:middle line:84%
But in a very,
very clear package.

00:11:22.197 --> 00:11:24.655 align:middle line:84%
So the way that-- you can tell
that they're speaking truth.

00:11:24.655 --> 00:11:26.071 align:middle line:84%
You can tell that
they're speaking

00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:90%
from truth, these two teachers.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And I feel myself to be very
much part of that lineage.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.245 align:middle line:84%
And a strong part
of the Gene Keys

00:11:37.245 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:84%
is this notion of
there being a synarchy.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:84%
A brotherhood, a
fellowship that exists

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:84%
at a higher plane of
consciousness that

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:84%
is waiting to incarnate
on this planet

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and then change the
structure of the planet.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.999 align:middle line:90%
It's an old prophecy.

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate it, because
I just wanted to know.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.807 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Its mystical, yes.

00:11:58.807 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you do have
deeply mystical roots.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.897 align:middle line:84%
And so naturally, that
spiked my interest.

00:12:03.897 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: People don't often
ask me those questions.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.772 align:middle line:90%
But it's good to have them.

00:12:07.772 --> 00:12:09.854 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank you.

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to go
into some of the structure.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.645 align:middle line:84%
We already talked about a little
of the foundational structure

00:12:14.645 --> 00:12:17.910 align:middle line:84%
of where Ra was, and
this has been built upon.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And you incorporate
the number of 64.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:90%
This seems to be very sacred.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%
And 64 gates.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about this.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.659 align:middle line:84%
The importance of
64 in the system.

00:12:28.659 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, 64 keeps
appearing everywhere.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:84%
It appears in the
structure of music,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.910 align:middle line:84%
which is the harmonic
nature of the cosmos.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:90%
The octaves.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:90%
The eight octaves.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:84%
It appears in the phi
ratio that underlies

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:84%
sacred architecture
and sacred geometry.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
It appears in our DNA
through 64 codons.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And more recently,
it appears to appear

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.240 align:middle line:84%
through the physics of a man
called Nassim Haramein, who's

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:84%
a physicist who I'm sure some
of your listeners will know.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have programs
with Nassim on them.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So he believes,
based on his research,

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:84%
that the actual underlying
matrix of space time

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:90%
is based on a 64-fold matrix.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.877 align:middle line:90%
So it appears in lots of places.

00:13:20.877 --> 00:13:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the I Ching?

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.751 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And of course
in the I Ching, which

00:13:23.751 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
tracks the seasons and the
fractal cycles of existence.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So it is an incredible
template for life

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and for the fractal
nature of the universe.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.380 align:middle line:84%
The way in which it expands and
the way in which it evolves.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So the Gene Keys is obviously
based on these 64 gene

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.830 align:middle line:84%
keys, that's what
they're called.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them is
a portal into the matrix.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have different--
there are many different ways

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:90%
into that matrix.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
DNA is one of them.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And you refer to
DNA very differently

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.700 align:middle line:90%
than it's normally referred to.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Because as I have
it written here,

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.220 align:middle line:84%
as a wormhole that opens to
the holographic universe.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's programmed
from conception.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like you spend
a little bit of time on that

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
so that we get the
scientific underpinnings--

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
the esoteric scientific
underpinnings for this.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.737 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Well, someone
recently said to me,

00:14:20.737 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:84%
they were talking
about the Gene Keys,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and they said, it's
really interesting

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:84%
to have DNA explained
and understood

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:84%
by a poet rather
than a scientist.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Because that's exactly
what you get from me.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.799 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a scientist.

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I have some basic
scientific understanding.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:35.839 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you're a mystic.

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:90%
So yes, DNA as a wormhole.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was my personal--
is my personal experience

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:84%
through having these
awakened experiences.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized that DNA is
the last line within our body

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:84%
before we enter the
subatomic world,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.810 align:middle line:90%
which is the world of the one.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So it is the very threshold
of the form and the formless,

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.830 align:middle line:90%
which is why it's the wormhole.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So when you contemplate
a series of archetypes

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:84%
that relate to your
DNA, then you're

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:84%
entering into
multiple wormholes.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.180 align:middle line:84%
But they all lead
to the same place.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But the journey for each
wormhole is very different.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So you can work with the Gene
Keys according to your own way.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But each one of them leads
you through some terrain

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.524 align:middle line:90%
that is uncomfortable.

00:15:38.524 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it does.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.898 align:middle line:84%
We are going to be
going into that.

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:41.852 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:41.852 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And you move
through that and out

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:84%
into the light of
the other side.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%
So it's an archetypal journey.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As you said, the
conversation, that three hour

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.440 align:middle line:84%
conversation you had with your
friend who was a psychiatrist,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.230 align:middle line:84%
you know that there's a
shadow side to each of these.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And I found the way you laid it
out, I mean, it's a fat book,

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
but I found it so
beautifully done.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.975 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it has
all this dimension.

00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:84%
All these ways of viewing
one's experience and interface

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:84%
with life from the
darkest of our hours

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:90%
to the absolute most sublime.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So when a person-- and we are
going to be telling everyone

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.789 align:middle line:84%
at the end that you can do
a self-test, and it's free.

00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:84%
You can get your own analysis
and then you buy the book

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and you can work with it
for a lifetime, really.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So when you're entering
the data to begin with,

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
are you going primarily
on the imprint

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:90%
of a name or a birth date?

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: A birth date.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say, that's
one way into the Gene Keys,

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:90%
through your birth date.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
the other way in?

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: There are
many other ways.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.659 align:middle line:84%
Some of them I haven't released
yet, but they're coming.

00:16:44.659 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're going
with the birthday.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.537 align:middle line:84%
Now, once a person has
established-- well,

00:16:50.537 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:84%
they have their chart
in front of them

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and have begun establishing
certain patterns, gates,

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
so forth, and looking
at what is active

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and what seems to be a little
more passive and not yet

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.130 align:middle line:90%
developed and so forth.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you find-- and I'm
tying this back to DNA--

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
do you find that there
are familial patterns that

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:84%
occur when you read people from
a particular lineage or family?

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: To be honest, I don't
do those kind of readings.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.630 align:middle line:90%
But I used to.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I used
to see them a lot.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.252 align:middle line:84%
And now what I do
when I'm with people

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:26.835 align:middle line:84%
who are starting the Gene Keys
is they bring out their profile

00:17:26.835 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:84%
often, and they can shove it
over towards me and go, go on.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Tell me something you see.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
see, because we're all

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:84%
connected by this same
wisdom, is repeating patterns

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that appear either in
my family or in my chart

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:84%
or in-- there are a
lot of repetitions,

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
which I call
fractal repetitions.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of the
wormholes that connect us.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I was talking
about synarchy,

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
they are the evidence, in a
way, of the divine pattern that

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
brings people together
at different times

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:90%
for different reasons.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.083 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And we hear about this in the
parlance of-- well, others

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:84%
who are dealing with the shadow
forces and DNA and subconscious

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
mind and so forth, where
we seem to be choosing

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.540 align:middle line:84%
a particular experience with
a particular group of people

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
or tribe until we work
through this thing.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.205 align:middle line:84%
And the thing we're working
through then, is the shadow.

00:18:28.205 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying that that
shadow, by virtue of this,

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
is essentially embedded from
the point of conception.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yes.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not from birth.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.922 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: No, from conception.

00:18:39.922 --> 00:18:40.755 align:middle line:90%
Because conception--

00:18:40.755 --> 00:18:42.546 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
this for a little bit.

00:18:42.546 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Well, conception
is the wormhole

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
that leads back through the
ancestral DNA, all the way back

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.510 align:middle line:84%
through mitochondrial DNA,
to the first Eve, so-called.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's all the different
lines of conception, moments

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:84%
of conception, where this
sacred wound is passed on

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:84%
from generation to
generation to generation.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And I call it the sacred
wound because the closer you

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
get to it, the more you're
standing on holy ground,

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.090 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So going into your
shadow is the place

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:90%
where the Gene Keys begins.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:18.807 align:middle line:84%
But the point of
conception, you don't

00:19:18.807 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
have to know your
point of conception.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't matter.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:26.070 align:middle line:84%
But that's where-- it's
like the mini Big Bang.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a holographic
echo of the Big Bang,

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
same set of forces

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that occur at that
point of conception.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:84%
So when the Big
Bang occurred, that

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.280 align:middle line:84%
was when the first wounding
of the cosmos occurred.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean the Big Bang
is a wound in a way.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It's beautiful, but
the wound is the split

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.310 align:middle line:84%
as these crystals
of consciousness

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:53.340 align:middle line:84%
shattered and started to create
the cosmos as we know it.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
But there was also a
hole that appeared.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:90%
The core.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.765 align:middle line:84%
You know, there has to be a
black hole, always at the core.

00:19:58.765 --> 00:20:00.369 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The core
of every atom.

00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the cosmos is endlessly
trying to fill that hole.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's the wound.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And until the cosmos gets
back and has filled that hole

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:90%
entirely, we won't be complete.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is also the journey
of the human evolution

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.750 align:middle line:90%
towards enlightenment.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It is going into this
dark place inside us

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.996 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that there's this
need in us to fill that hole.

00:20:24.996 --> 00:20:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And everything we do
in the outer world

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:90%
is trying to fill that hole.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So really, it's about
coming to acceptance

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.380 align:middle line:84%
of what that process
really means.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
so that's the part

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.544 align:middle line:90%
that we tend to run away from.

00:20:36.544 --> 00:20:38.335 align:middle line:84%
That's the part where
we go down to-- here,

00:20:38.335 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:84%
we go down to the
pub and have a pint,

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have
to deal with it.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Distract yourself so you
don't have to feel that, yeah.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:43.751 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:43.751 --> 00:20:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Now this is going to be
maybe totally off-topic,

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.477 align:middle line:90%
maybe not so much.

00:20:47.477 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
It's just something that's
popping up as you're talking.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about this DNA.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the familial patterns.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the soul
of the repetition of the things

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that we are continuing
to refine in ourselves.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
In the Rosicrucian
teachings, there

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
is a phenomena, which I've
just been thinking about this

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.810 align:middle line:84%
recently for a
particular reason, where

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:84%
the point at which a soul
departs the physical reality is

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:84%
often the same point one
tends to incarnate back

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.110 align:middle line:90%
into the physical reality.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Do you have anything
in there that

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:84%
kind of looks at or
addresses that dynamic?

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Certainly I think that
there are patterns of-- just

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:84%
as the Gene Keys is
about when we incarnate,

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:84%
it's very interesting
when we excarnate.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.705 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very dear friend
recently who excarnated,

00:21:35.705 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:90%
who left.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked at the
time to see when she left,

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:84%
because she left in
a very perfect way.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was deeply
tragic and painful for everyone,

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.760 align:middle line:84%
the actual passing was in a
very, very beautiful manner

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:90%
and a very beautiful location.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't have picked
a more holy moment.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And so it's always
of interest to me

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:84%
to look, well, what's the
pattern that she or any of us

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:90%
carry with us when we leave?

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And that pattern
will bring us back

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.559 align:middle line:84%
into another phase,
another cycle.

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:10.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I find
that fascinating.

00:22:10.975 --> 00:22:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, it is.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I know someone where
something very literally,

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:84%
within their family, happened
exactly like that recently.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.330 align:middle line:84%
It just brought
tears to my eyes.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, the Gene
Keys track these things.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.581 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can go
into the Gene Keys.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into how
it's laid out instead

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:84%
of going into the Projector,
Generator, and all that.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going into the
aspects like Activation.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:90%
The sequences.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Activation, Venus, and Pearl.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.756 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yes.

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:39.929 align:middle line:84%
I should probably backtrack
a little bit from that--

00:22:39.929 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure, do.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.345 align:middle line:90%
Whatever works.

00:22:41.345 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: --just so there's
a context around it.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.058 align:middle line:84%
When you begin working
with your profile,

00:22:45.058 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
your Gene Keys profile, which
I call hologenetic profile,

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.009 align:middle line:84%
bit of a mouthful, but
it says what it is.

00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And the more you go
into it, the more

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.030 align:middle line:84%
you realize what
that word means.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.390 align:middle line:84%
The profile is an
interactive profile.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's not information-based,
like a lot of profiles.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
You look at it and you
go, oh, I'm one of those.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of these.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:90%
It is an interactive map.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very complex.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Well, it
seems complex, yes.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.570 align:middle line:90%
But you take it step by step.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a very clear path,
logically laid out.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Step one, you know.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And step one begins with a
plate, the position of the sun

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:23.680 align:middle line:84%
when you were born, and so
your sun sign in astrology.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And in Gene Keys it's
called your life's work.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So you begin with,
what is the Gene

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Key you have for
you life's work.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:35.089 align:middle line:84%
And that tells you-- like my
life's work is the 64th Gene

00:23:35.089 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Key, as it happens.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.150 align:middle line:90%
The very end one.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
shadow of confusion,

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:84%
the gift of imagination,
and the siddhi,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:84%
which is the highest
aspect, is illumination.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So my life's work is to
overcome the confusion inside me

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
in order that I can use my
creative imagination to reach

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.660 align:middle line:84%
the state of illumination and
then pass that on to others.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Simply put.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.625 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could give you
hours on each Gene Key,

00:24:04.625 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:90%
but that's in a nutshell.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So the first path you go
through is called the activation

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.410 align:middle line:84%
sequence, and it's a
series of Gene Keys that

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:84%
relate to your purpose,
beginning with that one.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So phase one, part one, is
called the activation sequence.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It's about purpose, and
it's about anchoring

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.410 align:middle line:84%
the deep sense of
purpose that you have.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.950 align:middle line:84%
That you came to the world
with inside your body.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's always, in the
new age, looking for purpose.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.197 align:middle line:84%
What the Gene Keys--
the insight they

00:24:38.197 --> 00:24:40.030 align:middle line:84%
bring to you is that
purpose isn't something

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.520 align:middle line:90%
you're here to do.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:84%
It is a presence you
are here to emanate.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
find that presence,

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
relax, because you

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.761 align:middle line:84%
don't need to worry about
what you're here to do.

00:24:50.761 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:90%
That takes care of itself.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.853 align:middle line:84%
That comes out of your
sense of deep purpose.

00:24:54.853 --> 00:24:55.436 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:55.436 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I like this aspect of
your work, by the way.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, thank you.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:90%
So it kind of relaxes you.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And then part two, once you've
taken that information in,

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.124 align:middle line:84%
and there's a breakthrough to
be had in that, by the way.

00:25:08.124 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I should say
something about that.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.169 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, do.

00:25:11.169 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: When I'm talking to
people about the Gene Keys,

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking at the
Gene Keys from the outside,

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.320 align:middle line:84%
they haven't really
started learning yet.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:84%
You see this big book,
and it looks complex,

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.120 align:middle line:90%
and the profile seems complex.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And you just think, it's just
another complicated system.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:90%
I haven't got time.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go into that.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it looks
like from the outside.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.008 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But once
you start going,

00:25:32.008 --> 00:25:33.634 align:middle line:84%
it's really very
linear and clear.

00:25:33.634 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: But once you go
in, what you're really

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.380 align:middle line:90%
looking for is a breakthrough.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.374 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you've had
your first breakthrough,

00:25:40.374 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I always joke, it's kind of
like a really sweet golf shot.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm a golfer.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Or a tennis shot,
or whatever it is.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And you once you feel that kind
of deep harmony in your body,

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.760 align:middle line:90%
you want another one.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.757 align:middle line:84%
You spend your whole life
trying to get another one.

00:25:55.757 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you say, once you
have your first breakthrough,

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.022 align:middle line:90%
how would that occur?

00:26:00.022 --> 00:26:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: It can be
different levels.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:90%
It can be a mental breakthrough.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:90%
So you really have a deep--

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you just
understand it differently.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.534 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: --insight into
something in your life

00:26:07.534 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:90%
that you never saw before.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Or it can be an
emotional breakthrough.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.391 align:middle line:84%
A mental breakthrough,
I call it insight.

00:26:15.391 --> 00:26:17.390 align:middle line:84%
An emotional breakthrough
I call a breakthrough.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:18.723 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like a deepening.

00:26:18.723 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Which is an
emotional-- something

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:90%
opens up in your heart.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Some recognition at
a cellular level.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the deepest
is an epiphany,

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:84%
which is when all three levels
are involved, the physical as

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:29.370 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the DNA itself
mutates inside you and right

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:84%
down all those levels,
you have a kind

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.070 align:middle line:84%
of deep, cellular
certainty about something.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And it changes the direction
of your life to a degree.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And so the purpose of going
through this information

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.030 align:middle line:84%
in sequence, through these
sequences and layers,

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.926 align:middle line:84%
is to give you that
experience of an epiphany.

00:26:52.926 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the epiphany
is the thing

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.030 align:middle line:84%
that completely catapults
you into another level

00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:90%
of awareness.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.735 align:middle line:84%
And you want to have
more of those, for sure.

00:27:00.735 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
saying, do not skim.

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Do not skim.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do not
skim in this journey.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.469 align:middle line:90%
You can't, really.

00:27:06.469 --> 00:27:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could
try, but it would--

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: It's not a
knowledge for skimmers.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it
would not. [CHUCKLES]

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.500 align:middle line:84%
OK so now that you've
laid that foundation,

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and you've talked
about activation, let's

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.900 align:middle line:84%
go into what is termed as
the Venus phase of the chart.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, the second
phase is Venus Sequence.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:84%
You move from purpose
to partnership.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's the passage
to love, essentially.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.520 align:middle line:84%
It is the deepest part of
the whole Gene Keys work,

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's always the part that
I kind of hand to my heart,

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:90%
feel the most proud of.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I know how deep it is,
and it's extraordinary work.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the feminine
part of the Gene Keys.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And it takes you into
the series of Gene Keys

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.750 align:middle line:84%
that you have to follow
through in that sequence.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.910 align:middle line:90%
That are unlocked in a sequence.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Takes you back through
your childhood cycles,

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:84%
seven year cycles
of your childhood.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And they show you layers of
wounding that appeared around

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:08.770 align:middle line:84%
your heart in response to the
environment that you lived in.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's no blame on
that, because remember,

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the sacred wound was there
before you even born.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
the way in which it

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:90%
manifests in your life for you.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So you might have a specific
mental defense pattern,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:84%
for example, that evolved
when you were a teenager.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:84%
That's when the mental
defense pattern comes in,

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:90%
when you're a teenager.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
place you come to

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
is that pla-- you have to look
and see, well, what is it.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.780 align:middle line:84%
What is the belief
system that I took

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.900 align:middle line:84%
on in that period
of my life that

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
is stopping my
heart from opening

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and basically ruining my
relationships, endlessly.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So once you find that belief,
it's an extraordinary thing.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:84%
You find it, and it
starts to open up

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.344 align:middle line:90%
a portal to another layer.

00:28:54.344 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, the
Venus Sequence is

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.787 align:middle line:84%
a bit like cracking
the code of a safe.

00:28:57.787 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:90%
You turn it that way, it clicks.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.453 align:middle line:90%
You turn it that way, it clicks.

00:29:00.453 --> 00:29:02.480 align:middle line:84%
You turn it another
way, eventually you open

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.400 align:middle line:90%
and you get the heart inside.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:10%
So the next layer in
is the emotional layer,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.080 align:middle line:10%
and that's from eight till 14.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Puberty.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.870 align:middle line:90%
The second seven year cycle.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very tender
place for all of us,

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:24.930 align:middle line:84%
because that's where we create--
we had this fundamental defense

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:29.220 align:middle line:84%
strategy to protect our
hearts because of pain,

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.160 align:middle line:84%
emotional pain that
was in our environment.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Might be in our mother,
might be in our father,

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.410 align:middle line:90%
might be in other kids.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:90%
It could've been anything.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.450 align:middle line:90%
It could've been a divorce.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.672 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even
have to be an event.

00:29:37.672 --> 00:29:38.630 align:middle line:90%
But it was in the aura.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.934 align:middle line:90%
It's in the world.

00:29:39.934 --> 00:29:40.600 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It's in the frequency
of consciousness

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.860 align:middle line:90%
on the human plane.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So that Gene Key-- and
it has a line number.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:52.033 align:middle line:84%
They all have line numbers,
which also I talk about.

00:29:52.033 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:84%
But that Gene Key explains
the specific pattern that

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.320 align:middle line:84%
repeats in your
emotional life, that

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:90%
keeps your heart protected.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a memory in
the cells of the body.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And you have to become
more aware of it.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So in the video sequence,
you make your relationships,

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
your spiritual path,
they become central.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.785 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has
relationships, right?

00:30:17.785 --> 00:30:19.160 align:middle line:84%
If it's an intimate
relationship,

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:90%
that's the best one to go for.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not in a currently
very intimate relationship,

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.637 align:middle line:84%
you just take the hardest
relationship you have.

00:30:26.637 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:84%
It could be your mother-in-law,
it doesn't matter.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.150 align:middle line:84%
You focus on where the energy
is at its most challenging,

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.060 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to see your
own patterns reflected back.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a process of deep
awareness of your own wounding.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So the Venus Sequence
is a wound map.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it
and it's fairly

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.200 align:middle line:90%
prominent in most charts.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:84%
You can see, because you have
the layers and the colors,

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and you think, [GASP] what's
all that red doing there.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Really? [CHUCKLES]
But most of us

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.190 align:middle line:84%
are carrying around loads
of subconscious pain

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.269 align:middle line:90%
and dysfunction.

00:30:58.269 --> 00:31:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: The good news is though,
that actually, it just takes

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.170 align:middle line:90%
awareness to clear the pattern.

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Which is of course
what people have

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.220 align:middle line:90%
been saying for a long time.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.794 align:middle line:84%
But to actually
find the pattern.

00:31:09.794 --> 00:31:11.710 align:middle line:84%
That's where the Gene
Keys are really helpful,

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.020 align:middle line:84%
because they show you,
specifically, a pattern

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:90%
to contemplate and watch for.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And once you begin to
contemplate it and watch it,

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.190 align:middle line:84%
it begins to show
itself very quickly,

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to feel
a bit of discomfort.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So you have three levels
in the Venus Sequence.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
It's called Allow,
Accept, and Embrace.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you have to put as
Larry the Cable Guy would say,

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:90%
your big girl under britches on.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:90%
In order to embrace it.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:90%
You do, really.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.240 align:middle line:90%
It takes courage.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: It takes courage,
and it takes time.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And the process of
getting to Embrace

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:53.020 align:middle line:90%
requires a lot of commitment.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.350 align:middle line:84%
The Gene Keys
require commitment.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And they also require support
in the Venus Sequence stage.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend that people to
with friends or with someone

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.070 align:middle line:90%
that they trust.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're doing
it on their own,

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I recommend that
they have someone.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Because it's about
relationships, to feed back to.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have to
be willing to be vulnerable

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.970 align:middle line:90%
and seen for what you are.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.890 align:middle line:90%
As this is indicating you are.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And just
accept what you feel

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.737 align:middle line:84%
at every stage, deeper
and deeper and deeper.

00:32:22.737 --> 00:32:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And it goes on getting deeper,
because eventually you get back

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:84%
to that first seven
year cycle where

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the physical
imprinting took place.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the deepest,
because it's about our birth

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and how we came
out into the world.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And in there is a
sphere, a position

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:41.300 align:middle line:84%
called the SQ, the
Spiritual Quotient.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Gene Key that
you have in that position

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:50.940 align:middle line:84%
relates to a very deep urge
that your physical body

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.460 align:middle line:84%
has been seeking
throughout your life.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Ever since you were
six or seven or three.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Our memories mostly
stop at around four.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But before that, they're
remembered by the body.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.310 align:middle line:90%
They're cellular.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So the body remembers, even
though the mind may not

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.530 align:middle line:90%
remember.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to get
back to this deep--

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.480 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is, urge.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It might be a feeling of
community for some people.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.009 align:middle line:84%
So that person will
be driven to find--

00:33:20.009 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's more
like a soul urge.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, to
find their community,

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and they'll move the
whole planet, endlessly,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.400 align:middle line:90%
trying to find this thing.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's inside them.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're driven by these
deep motivating forces.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
see what yours is.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize,
oh, it's inside me.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to-- I've been
looking my whole life outside.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.800 align:middle line:84%
So when you see it,
it's remarkable.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Because suddenly
your heart relaxes.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:90%
And the heart opens in layers.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So the Venus Sequence
encourages layer by layer.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:90%
It's very gentle in that way.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:84%
It's very holding,
it's very tender.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.782 align:middle line:90%
The language used around it.

00:33:57.782 --> 00:33:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you
say, what a release,

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:84%
to be able to finally identify
that aspect of yourself that's

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:90%
been seeking its own expression.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Absolutely.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.531 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:06.531 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:90%
So what about the Pearl part?

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.382 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: The Pearl.

00:34:09.382 --> 00:34:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have to just
finish the Venus Sequence,

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.050 align:middle line:90%
because it leads into the Pearl.

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:16.020 align:middle line:84%
The way these are
holographic is that they

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.739 align:middle line:84%
fold-- they're
enfolded in each other.

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:20.118 align:middle line:90%
So purpose comes first.

00:34:20.118 --> 00:34:21.659 align:middle line:84%
Once you're anchored
in your purpose,

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:27.480 align:middle line:84%
you're ready to go into your
relationships with a new view.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Once you've got to the final
spirit of the Venus Sequence,

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.110 align:middle line:90%
it's called The Core.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I call
it the Core Wound,

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.110 align:middle line:84%
but some people don't
like the sound of that.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.600 align:middle line:84%
That relates to the
point of conception.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And it relates to the journey
from conception to birth.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was is in
those nine months

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that all our patterns
are laid down.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.540 align:middle line:84%
All our holding patterns, all
our kind of resistance patterns

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.040 align:middle line:84%
are actually imprinted in
those three trimesters.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very,
very precious time.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for your awareness
to start reaching back

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:09.637 align:middle line:84%
beyond the point of your birth
is a very, very deep level

00:35:09.637 --> 00:35:10.345 align:middle line:90%
of contemplation.

00:35:10.345 --> 00:35:13.605 align:middle line:84%
And actually, contemplation
then turns into something else.

00:35:13.605 --> 00:35:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It becomes absorption,
which is a mystical state,

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:19.680 align:middle line:84%
as your awareness starts
to turn in on its own

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.100 align:middle line:90%
and reach the core.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- this is
like deep meditation.

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:28.710 align:middle line:84%
This is where your whole aura
starts to fold in on itself,

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and you go into deep periods
of spontaneous silence.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the essence
is seeking itself.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.160 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to get back to
that point of conception.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where--
the point of conception

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.880 align:middle line:90%
is where enlightenment is.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Because that's where it began.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.880 align:middle line:90%
So that's where it ends.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So your awareness has to travel
through all these layers,

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:49.600 align:middle line:84%
past your birth, and
the breath patterns that

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:84%
came through your birth, to
this quiet, silent place.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.645 align:middle line:84%
And when it hits that core, it's
an extraordinary experience.

00:35:57.645 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had
that experience.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying I'm
awake, but I've

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.550 align:middle line:84%
had an experience of
my awareness hitting

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.320 align:middle line:90%
the core inside me.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's beyond words.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.340 align:middle line:90%
It can't be described.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.899 align:middle line:84%
Even talking about it, I feel
like I might cry, so [SIGH].

00:36:14.899 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a moment you
understood what your being was

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.100 align:middle line:84%
trying to express
in this incarnation.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: I think what I
experienced when that happened

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.980 align:middle line:84%
to me was I saw the wound
of-- the sacred wound

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.620 align:middle line:90%
of the whole of humanity.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.340 align:middle line:90%
I felt it.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.215 align:middle line:90%
I didn't just see it.

00:36:31.215 --> 00:36:31.936 align:middle line:90%
I felt it.

00:36:31.936 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:90%
It was deeply uncomfortable.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it made me feel sick
to the core of my being.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But I see the
preciousness of it,

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:41.370 align:middle line:84%
because just the other
side of it is the light.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it contains the light.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.470 align:middle line:90%
It contains all the light.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it's before
consciousness began.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.450 align:middle line:90%
So you have to penetrate that.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's the final stage
of the Venus Sequence.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.530 align:middle line:90%
It's very mystical.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I haven't really taught
that one, because I'm not

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.160 align:middle line:90%
there yet myself, for one thing.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's a
path of silence.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a mystical
path that will

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.070 align:middle line:84%
come in the evolution
of the Gene Keys.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.340 align:middle line:90%
I feel that.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But then you get to the
Pearl, which is, by the way,

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:19.370 align:middle line:84%
the one all the men want to get,
because it's about prosperity.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.154 align:middle line:84%
So they go, can't I
do the Pearl first?

00:37:21.154 --> 00:37:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't have to look
at this other stuff. [LAUGHS]

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:25.945 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: No, I don't do this
heart, woman, feminine stuff.

00:37:25.945 --> 00:37:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to just go
and get the money.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It's very funny to me that
the order of the sequence

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:32.830 align:middle line:90%
is this way.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Purpose, partnerships,
prosperity.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.480 align:middle line:84%
You only know what
prosperity is, truly,

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.857 align:middle line:90%
when your heart is open.

00:37:40.857 --> 00:37:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, you
don't know why you're here.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.231 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what to give to.

00:37:44.231 --> 00:37:47.210 align:middle line:84%
You don't know who to-- you
don't know-- you can't give.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough
to give of yourself.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So you need your purpose
to know where to give,

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and then you need your heart
open to know how to give.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the Pearl
shows you to whom.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:06.320 align:middle line:84%
It shows you your connection
to the collective.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So it places you-- literally,
when your heart is opened,

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:13.710 align:middle line:84%
serendipity places you
exactly where you are needed.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you the prosperity
that you need in order

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.490 align:middle line:90%
to achieve your purpose.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:20.340 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.730 align:middle line:84%
You just have to do
the awareness thing.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.420 align:middle line:90%
And then you get the prosperity.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.960 align:middle line:84%
The Pearl is a sort of
finale of the golden path.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
sequences are known as.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.730 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting to look at it.

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I look at the Pearl with people
who are working in groups.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And there are things you can
see, because there are places--

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.865 align:middle line:84%
there are ways in which we
work with each other that

00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:50.062 align:middle line:84%
are designed to
be easier for us.

00:38:50.062 --> 00:38:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you see
what your Pearl is,

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.070 align:middle line:84%
you see what you're not
here to do, in a group.

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you see, for instance, it
might be that like, in my case.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.045 align:middle line:84%
I'm about-- the
keynotes are very funny.

00:39:02.045 --> 00:39:03.170 align:middle line:90%
They're corporate keynotes.

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I've taken corporate words and
sort of breathed a new life

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:06.250 align:middle line:90%
into them.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.035 align:middle line:90%
So the first one is Production.

00:39:08.035 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:90%
So I'm Production.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.680 align:middle line:90%
There's only six.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to be one of them.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.590 align:middle line:90%
So I'm Production.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.281 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just a
machine for the Gods.

00:39:14.281 --> 00:39:16.822 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's kind of
like what a Generator is, even

00:39:16.822 --> 00:39:17.420 align:middle line:90%
in Human Design.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:17.885 align:middle line:90%
A lot of energy.

00:39:17.885 --> 00:39:18.926 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: I pump out books.

00:39:18.926 --> 00:39:21.140 align:middle line:90%
I pump out this.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm just producing it.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.959 align:middle line:90%
But the second one is marketing.

00:39:23.959 --> 00:39:25.250 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea about marketing.

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I've never known,
really, how to market.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Strategy is the third one.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Again, not my scene.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.060 align:middle line:84%
The fourth one is
Sales, which is

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.580 align:middle line:84%
a resonance with the
first one, but it's still

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.412 align:middle line:90%
a different realm.

00:39:36.412 --> 00:39:37.620 align:middle line:90%
And then you have Management.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:38.911 align:middle line:90%
And then you have Philanthropy.

00:39:38.911 --> 00:39:41.200 align:middle line:90%
That's another story.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But those six, when you
see which one you are,

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:90%
you see which ones you're not.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.000 align:middle line:90%
So it shows you, relax.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.840 align:middle line:84%
You're not meant
to do all of these.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.030 align:middle line:90%
People take on so much.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:90%
They try to do all of these.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But because their hearts
haven't opened fully,

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.190 align:middle line:84%
they're not drawing
in the people

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.770 align:middle line:90%
that will do the other things.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:90%
It's magnetic.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Synchronicity brings them in.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is how-- the
Gene Keys, what it does,

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:10.465 align:middle line:84%
is it just describes the
life when freed from fear.

00:40:10.465 --> 00:40:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.420 align:middle line:90%
That's all it does.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It describes your process.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And it allows you to
go through a process

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.440 align:middle line:84%
of letting go of the
layers of that fear,

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time,
watching the miracles come in.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Because that's a byproduct.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.061 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and one
of the beautiful elements

00:40:27.061 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:84%
is that ultimately,
you should discover

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.880 align:middle line:90%
your genius in yourself.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And for people who have not
discovered their genius,

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.340 align:middle line:84%
because of all these other
wound factors we've discussed,

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.920 align:middle line:84%
the vast majority
of people really

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.510 align:middle line:84%
don't discover their
genius, is my observation.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain how the
word genius is used first

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:47.170 align:middle line:84%
in this system,
and then what we're

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.860 align:middle line:84%
feeling like when
we're not finding it.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And then question number
three, embedded in that,

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:52.550 align:middle line:90%
how do we get to it?

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.051 align:middle line:90%
How do we finally discover it?

00:40:55.051 --> 00:40:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Well, I
used the word genius

00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:00.880 align:middle line:84%
because when you talk
about the Gene Keys,

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.510 align:middle line:84%
people receive a
lot of information.

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:04.725 align:middle line:84%
And it's on different
levels, the information.

00:41:04.725 --> 00:41:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Gene Keys, I
call it a transmission.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
information that is mental.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:14.680 align:middle line:84%
It also travels at an emotional
level and at a cellular level.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So I hope that people who are
watching this, some of you

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.820 align:middle line:84%
may feel things
going off inside you.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.020 align:middle line:84%
That's because it's
a transmission.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And I give the word
genius because it's

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.590 align:middle line:84%
kind of an easy
thing to remember.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's true, it
is about genius.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't remember
anything about the Gene Keys,

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the pub, and
you're talking to someone,

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:33.755 align:middle line:84%
and they say, what
is that thing?

00:41:33.755 --> 00:41:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And you go, oh,
it's about genius.

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really good
one word, one line.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:39.530 align:middle line:90%
But it is about genius.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has
that light inside.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is born with that.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.220 align:middle line:90%
And yes, you're right.

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Most people are living lives of
compromise, where they believe

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:55.645 align:middle line:84%
that genius is somewhere--
oh well, I'll maybe get it

00:41:55.645 --> 00:41:57.020 align:middle line:84%
when I've got to
the end of this,

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.160 align:middle line:84%
or when I've paid off my
mortgage, then I'll do it.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Or when I'm
enlightened, then I'll

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.810 align:middle line:90%
have it, this and this and this.

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very sad.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:05.393 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Right.

00:42:05.393 --> 00:42:06.850 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a-- yeah, it is sad.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing you
have to see through

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:84%
is that pattern that
makes you believe

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.340 align:middle line:90%
that you can't claim it.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're at
the end of your life,

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.670 align:middle line:90%
you can still claim it.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I had, this morning,
a conversation

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.567 align:middle line:90%
with a lovely older man.

00:42:22.567 --> 00:42:23.900 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what is this thing?

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.170 align:middle line:90%
And I said, it's genius.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.521 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
it's too late for me.

00:42:27.521 --> 00:42:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, why don't you
end your life with a bang?

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.180 align:middle line:90%
It's never too late.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the light's
always inside us.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.370 align:middle line:90%
When you're older, it's closer.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Because you're more open.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Because you're thinking
about-- you know, departing.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, for all of us, there
is a very clear path to it.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Gene Keys lays down.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:54.160 align:middle line:84%
A very clear, step by step
path that you use contemplation

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.360 align:middle line:84%
as an art, as a way
of moving closer.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have to see the layers
that are in the way first.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And then as they
dissolve, you begin

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to see the genius rising up
in your heart, essentially.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Because it does come
through our heart.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:14.410 align:middle line:84%
The genius flowers
when our heart flowers.

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:18.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we might know
that we're more removed from it,

00:43:18.605 --> 00:43:22.110 align:middle line:84%
or blocked from it, in
terms of the amount of pain

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:23.610 align:middle line:90%
we're experiencing in our lives.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, pain is a
wonderful indicator

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:27.250 align:middle line:84%
throughout all of
this, isn't it?

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: It is.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.359 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:28.359 --> 00:43:31.090 align:middle line:90%
Especially physical pain.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:34.730 align:middle line:84%
People with physical
things in their body.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a really good way to
begin, because physical pain,

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:42.721 align:middle line:84%
as you said, it's an indicator
of an issue or a shadow

00:43:42.721 --> 00:43:43.220 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:90%
So it needs to be explored.

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:47.257 align:middle line:90%
It's why it's hurting.

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Because it's saying, look,
there's something here.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.220 align:middle line:90%
This is your route.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.430 align:middle line:90%
This is the way.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.979 align:middle line:90%
Follow me.

00:43:51.979 --> 00:43:53.020 align:middle line:90%
This is the White Rabbit.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Down, follow me down the hole.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's the last thing
most people want to look at.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.090 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
you have to look.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.540 align:middle line:90%
That place that hurts the most.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And you have to go
in and explore it.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.260 align:middle line:90%
It's the same in relationships.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:09.030 align:middle line:84%
The issues-- the relationships
that are hardest,

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:11.849 align:middle line:84%
those are the ones that
you need to explore.

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Because they contain
the greatest gifts and rewards.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's use someone as an example.

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think, when we were
emailing back and forth

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.180 align:middle line:84%
a couple of months ago,
deciding to do this,

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I think I had asked you for a
chart of someone well-known.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.070 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not mistaken, did you
say we might take a look at--

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:30.182 align:middle line:90%
was it Deepak Chopra.

00:44:30.182 --> 00:44:31.223 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: We did do Deepak.

00:44:31.223 --> 00:44:33.102 align:middle line:84%
And I've completely
forgotten his--

00:44:33.102 --> 00:44:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:34.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Is there someone
else that you can

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:38.530 align:middle line:84%
think of so we can kind
of get an idea of what

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.810 align:middle line:90%
that looks like.

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.144 align:middle line:90%
Put a face to it, so we can see.

00:44:41.144 --> 00:44:41.934 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, sure.

00:44:41.934 --> 00:44:44.450 align:middle line:84%
The one I can think of, I
don't know why he's coming up,

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:49.980 align:middle line:84%
is the teacher, Sai Baba,
who's a controversial teacher,

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.620 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But it always makes me laugh,
because he has the 14th Gene

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Key, I think.

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:59.030 align:middle line:90%
That's his life's work.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is one that's about--
the siddhi, the highest aspect,

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:05.700 align:middle line:90%
is about bounteousness.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And so he's known
as someone that

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.700 align:middle line:84%
can manifest-- I mean,
whether you believe in it

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.170 align:middle line:90%
or not doesn't matter.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:15.072 align:middle line:84%
Gold watches and
vibhuti, the sacred ash.

00:45:15.072 --> 00:45:16.859 align:middle line:90%
And he has this kind of aura.

00:45:16.859 --> 00:45:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: His manifestation
abilities, yes.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: And it's
interesting to me,

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:25.000 align:middle line:84%
because the siddhis, these
higher states, they do really

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:25.960 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But we've completely
forgotten them.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.010 align:middle line:84%
We think they're kind of
the superheroes on TV,

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:32.790 align:middle line:90%
and they're just fantasy.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:34.760 align:middle line:90%
But they are absolutely real.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.537 align:middle line:84%
And there are 64 of
them, variations.

00:45:39.537 --> 00:45:42.120 align:middle line:84%
When I discovered that, by the
way, it was really interesting.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I googled 64
siddhis and discovered

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.100 align:middle line:84%
there is a tradition
of the 64 siddhis.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:45:48.365 --> 00:45:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, like you said,
it was a download.

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.497 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, it was.

00:45:52.497 --> 00:45:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll be doing
courses about them

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.560 align:middle line:84%
in the future, about what
each siddhi looks like.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are truly
magical powers or miracles.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Others are more sort of
ordinary, but really beautiful.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Compassion is a siddhi.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all the siddhis
contain each other.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So every siddhi has at
its heart, compassion.

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And peace is another one.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:19.520 align:middle line:84%
But they all have--
they're the manifestations

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.780 align:middle line:90%
of enlightenment.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, what the Gene Keys
provides through this complex

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:28.010 align:middle line:84%
looking profile is
a map of what you

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:29.770 align:middle line:84%
look like when
you're enlightened.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:31.710 align:middle line:90%
It's quite extraordinary.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know where
that exists anywhere else.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.380 align:middle line:84%
It gives you that vision
to balance the shadow work.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.760 align:middle line:90%
And you have to have that.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that vision of
yourself as a higher being

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.340 align:middle line:84%
is more important
than the shadow.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So I would say to people, put
80% or 90% of your awareness

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.250 align:middle line:84%
in that higher
vision of yourself,

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and keep the 10% on your
shadow, just so that you're

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.882 align:middle line:90%
vigilant in the watching for it.

00:46:57.882 --> 00:46:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
just take a moment.

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Because you've spoken
quite a lot about siddhis.

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking about
C-I-T-Y or C-I-T-I-E-S.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Talk about siddhi
as you know it.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Siddhi.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.780 align:middle line:84%
S-I-D-D-H-I. It's a Sanskrit
word meaning divine gift,

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:18.250 align:middle line:84%
or examination of-- it's
your highest emanation.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:20.190 align:middle line:84%
There's another
English word for that.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's your
highest emanation.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:22.493 align:middle line:84%
Just think in case
anyone thought

00:47:22.493 --> 00:47:23.230 align:middle line:90%
you were talking about cities.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So in Gene Keys,
you have these three levels

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:25.580 align:middle line:90%
for each Gene Key.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.650 align:middle line:84%
A shadow, a gift,
and the siddhi.

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.530 align:middle line:90%
So you have these three levels.

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And the siddhi, which
is the highest essence,

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.880 align:middle line:84%
is actually hidden
in the shadow.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Which is why you have to
go through the wormhole

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.579 align:middle line:84%
of the shadow to
get to the gold.

00:47:38.579 --> 00:47:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go to
what happened when

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.910 align:middle line:84%
you were writing
the 55th Gene key.

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: OK.

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:48.840 align:middle line:84%
55th Gene Key is a
big transmission.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, when I
started to write that one,

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.960 align:middle line:84%
it just carried on writing
and carried on writing,

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and it opened up.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:00.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the gift and the
siddhi are the same,

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and the word is freedom and
the shadow is victimization.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.002 align:middle line:84%
So it's victimization
to freedom.

00:48:07.002 --> 00:48:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
for me in that one

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.570 align:middle line:84%
is I realized that
there's a mutation taking

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:13.436 align:middle line:90%
place in humanity.

00:48:13.436 --> 00:48:15.560 align:middle line:84%
This is something that I
learned from Human Design.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.690 align:middle line:84%
But I never actually
felt it in Human Design.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:23.610 align:middle line:84%
But I felt it when I went
into the 55th Gene Key.

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a place inside
all human beings where

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:29.390 align:middle line:84%
a change, a genetic
change is taking place.

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And that change is bringing
increased awareness

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:34.790 align:middle line:90%
to people all over the planet.

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And the increase
in awareness begins

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:39.710 align:middle line:84%
with us pulling out
these victim patterns.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Which is what the new age
is bringing us towards.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you begin with
aromatherapy or something,

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.410 align:middle line:90%
and it's gentle.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you
go to Dr. Phil. [LAUGHS]

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:49.846 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Exactly.

00:48:49.846 --> 00:48:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, you evolve
and you find your way up

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:54.520 align:middle line:84%
to this shadow work, and
you start pulling out

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.300 align:middle line:84%
these victim
patterns inside you.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
find your purpose.

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And you start to open
your heart again.

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
reaching the higher levels.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:08.199 align:middle line:84%
So the 55, as a Gene Key, I
recommend everyone read it.

00:49:08.199 --> 00:49:08.740 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a prophetic piece of
crazy writing in a way.

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:16.210 align:middle line:84%
It's for free on my
website, just sitting there.

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:19.460 align:middle line:84%
It explains this
massive change that's

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:24.020 align:middle line:84%
about to take place in
humanity and on our planet.

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And after I'd written
it, I thought,

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.250 align:middle line:90%
can I really put that out there?

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:90%
All that?

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:29.703 align:middle line:90%
It was really quite fantastical.

00:49:29.703 --> 00:49:31.445 align:middle line:84%
That the world is
going to change

00:49:31.445 --> 00:49:33.630 align:middle line:90%
on so many different levels.

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
this-- we're changing

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.100 align:middle line:84%
from inside our
genetic structure.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Mother nature is mutating
us, because we are now

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.010 align:middle line:90%
a danger to the planet.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And when that's happened in the
past, when a creature becomes

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.240 align:middle line:84%
a danger to the whole
planet, it mutates.

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Because in a way,
that's its-- that's

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:53.690 align:middle line:90%
the breakthrough it needs.

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:56.420 align:middle line:84%
It's accelerated and been
so successful in one realm,

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:59.280 align:middle line:84%
it then has to mutate
to the next level.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So the 55th Gene
Key is a mutation

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:06.610 align:middle line:84%
that takes place in our belly,
in our solar plexus, which

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:09.050 align:middle line:90%
is opening up a new awareness.

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:10.390 align:middle line:90%
A collective awareness.

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:12.260 align:middle line:90%
A spiritual awareness.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.720 align:middle line:90%
An awakened awareness.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.835 align:middle line:90%
And it's in the belly.

00:50:14.835 --> 00:50:18.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it moving away from
victimization toward freedom.

00:50:18.055 --> 00:50:18.555 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yes.

00:50:18.555 --> 00:50:19.221 align:middle line:90%
Towards freedom.

00:50:19.221 --> 00:50:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Freedom at the deepest
level of the word.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:24.539 align:middle line:84%
So it's opening up freedom in
our genetic matrix inside us.

00:50:24.539 --> 00:50:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:25.720 align:middle line:90%
That's big.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: That's huge.

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:28.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why in that
Gene Key, I describe

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:33.396 align:middle line:84%
the potential
far-reaching results.

00:50:33.396 --> 00:50:36.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, the byproduct through
our society as that change

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:37.790 align:middle line:90%
comes.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So the environment
changes, the schools

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:44.530 align:middle line:84%
change, the way in which we run
governments, it all changes.

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Science changes.

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is this
commonly found, for example,

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:50.870 align:middle line:84%
in the activation part
of people's charts?

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:52.217 align:middle line:90%
Or is this rare?

00:50:52.217 --> 00:50:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: The 55th Gene Key?

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.600 align:middle line:84%
It's sprinkled liberally
throughout the genome.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.860 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just out of
curiosity, what's the 56th Key?

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Intoxication is
the siddhi and distraction

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:04.510 align:middle line:90%
is the shadow.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can see the
connections between them.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:09.040 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, it's a nice one.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Is that one of yours?

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.020 align:middle line:90%
It just popped into my head.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.853 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I remember
seeing a 56 somewhere.

00:51:13.853 --> 00:51:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, every Gene
Key has a relationship

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.020 align:middle line:90%
to a kind of deity.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:22.095 align:middle line:84%
And every Gene Key has a
relationship to a plant

00:51:22.095 --> 00:51:24.280 align:middle line:90%
and an animal and a mineral.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.680 align:middle line:90%
They're fractal.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a fractal wisdom, this.

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So the deity of that
one would be Dionysus.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:36.890 align:middle line:84%
The love of-- the
exquisite love of life,

00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:40.035 align:middle line:84%
and the celebration of
life, and the wine of life.

00:51:40.035 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:90%
And so it's language.

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:45.647 align:middle line:90%
Intoxication is of that realm.

00:51:45.647 --> 00:51:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Now we really do have only
about five minutes now.

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into everything
we haven't covered

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:54.910 align:middle line:84%
yet and kind of wrap
this around again.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing I would
like you to touch on

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.140 align:middle line:84%
is some people are
listening and thinking,

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.970 align:middle line:84%
God, it sounds so
beautiful, I don't

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:03.000 align:middle line:84%
know that I have the
depth to even pursue it.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.860 align:middle line:84%
You have a Gene Keys Light,
and then the Gene Keys

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.820 align:middle line:84%
where you can really go
in at sublime levels,

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.350 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
self-test, right?

00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yes.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:17.350 align:middle line:84%
You start by getting a profile,
which is free on genekeys.com.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:19.000 align:middle line:90%
And then you can look at that.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you're advised
to buy the book,

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.620 align:middle line:90%
because then you can begin to--

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You really
need to, actually.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: I mean, there is
a lot of free material

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.280 align:middle line:90%
before you do that.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can-- there's a
lot of things you can--

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.004 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but it's so nice
to look at every Key-- I mean,

00:52:30.004 --> 00:52:31.295 align:middle line:90%
we didn't talk about the lines.

00:52:31.295 --> 00:52:32.990 align:middle line:90%
We just talked about the gates.

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Not the connecting between
the gates and what all that

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.060 align:middle line:84%
means, because we
don't have time.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.380 align:middle line:90%
But I agree with you.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to have it
sitting right there so you

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:43.392 align:middle line:84%
can kind of get to it
and start the journey.

00:52:43.392 --> 00:52:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Harder to do it when you're
poking around on the web.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.599 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Yeah, the book
you can use in many ways.

00:52:47.599 --> 00:52:49.770 align:middle line:84%
You can use it as an
Oracle, as a companion,

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:51.185 align:middle line:84%
in the same way
as the original I

00:52:51.185 --> 00:52:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Ching was intended to be used.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Or you can begin using
it with your profile,

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.450 align:middle line:90%
to decipher your profile.

00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done is I've
created a program that

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:04.652 align:middle line:84%
shows you how to use the
book and your profile.

00:53:04.652 --> 00:53:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So you need three
elements, really,

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:08.040 align:middle line:90%
to begin studying the Gene Keys.

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.820 align:middle line:90%
And the program has 33 steps.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:11.800 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds a lot.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.520 align:middle line:84%
It's arranged in
these sequences;

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Activation Sequence, Venus
Sequence, Pearl Sequence.

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.790 align:middle line:84%
By the way, it's incredibly
affordable, I should say.

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And the program takes
you through step by step.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.830 align:middle line:84%
The first step is
free on the website,

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:28.650 align:middle line:84%
so people can look
at it and see.

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:30.390 align:middle line:90%
It gives you very simple things.

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Read this.

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Contemplate this.

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Listen to this audio.

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:90%
Watch this webinar.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:37.580 align:middle line:84%
There are layers
of information that

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.510 align:middle line:84%
take you step by step
deeper and deeper and deeper

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:41.390 align:middle line:90%
into the matrix.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And it gets-- so it kind of
holds your hand as you go in.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.866 align:middle line:84%
And you start with
dipping your toe.

00:53:47.866 --> 00:53:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And then you put your foot.

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:50.073 align:middle line:90%
And then you put your leg.

00:53:50.073 --> 00:53:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, right,
I'm going the whole way in.

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And once you're in, that's
when the breakthroughs come.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you're on the inside
of the knowledge and the wisdom

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:00.020 align:middle line:90%
rather than on the outside.

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you get it,
and you go, [SIGH] God,

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.209 align:middle line:90%
this is so exciting.

00:54:04.209 --> 00:54:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, you mentioned
earlier in our conversation

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:10.890 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't speak about--
you weren't teaching this one

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.600 align:middle line:84%
area because you
hadn't gone there yet.

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So where's your work
evolving right now?

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: I'm teaching
in Canada next June.

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:23.670 align:middle line:84%
A very refined retreat
that is about the opening

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:25.625 align:middle line:84%
of-- the permanent
opening of our heart.

00:54:25.625 --> 00:54:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So my work right now
is about the heart.

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And until the heart
is completely open,

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:36.150 align:middle line:84%
you don't take that journey
down that final wormhole

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.670 align:middle line:90%
that leads to a full awakening.

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So the heart opening is the real
culled face of the Gene Keys.

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:45.800 align:middle line:90%
It's the juiciest part.

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It is the part of
the Venus Sequence

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:50.700 align:middle line:84%
where people really
get stuck in.

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.015 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
people now assembling

00:54:53.015 --> 00:54:56.980 align:middle line:84%
in different countries
around the world using it,

00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and in all kinds
of different ways.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.240 align:middle line:84%
The Gene Keys is a
very liberal system.

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.960 align:middle line:90%
It's set up non-hierarchical.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not franchised out.

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:06.620 align:middle line:90%
It's given out to countries.

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:07.940 align:middle line:90%
It's given to people freely.

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the teaching of
philanthropy in the Pearl.

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a completely
different model

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:17.740 align:middle line:84%
of sharing sacred knowledge
from other systems that

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:19.050 align:middle line:90%
have appeared.

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, you have to
still charge the golden path,

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.210 align:middle line:90%
otherwise you can't maintain it.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:24.850 align:middle line:84%
You can't keep doing
what you're doing.

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:29.445 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: So a lot
of it is available.

00:55:29.445 --> 00:55:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are a lot of
people making the transition

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:34.240 align:middle line:84%
from Human Design into Gene
Keys as they find out about it?

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.372 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how well-known
is it globally, now?

00:55:37.372 --> 00:55:38.540 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of everywhere?

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah, I think so.

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.889 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:39.889 --> 00:55:42.890 align:middle line:84%
It's accelerating very
rapidly, because it

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:44.639 align:middle line:84%
brings this other
element and layer.

00:55:44.639 --> 00:55:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are coming to Gene Keys

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:48.610 align:middle line:84%
without knowing Human
Design, which in some ways,

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:50.410 align:middle line:90%
is an advantage.

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Because then they don't have
to deprogram and reprogram

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:55.629 align:middle line:84%
the way in which Human Design
has trained them to think.

00:55:55.629 --> 00:55:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
going to have to open

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.700 align:middle line:84%
their minds to
another dimension.

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Some people are ready
to do that anyway.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Some people won't
want to do that.

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:06.085 align:middle line:84%
They will want to stay with the
original system and its kind.

00:56:06.085 --> 00:56:07.779 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's nothing
wrong with the original Human

00:56:07.779 --> 00:56:08.279 align:middle line:90%
Design.

00:56:08.279 --> 00:56:11.000 align:middle line:84%
One thing about it is that if
you want to know, essentially,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.680 align:middle line:84%
how you function best, and how
you function with other people,

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.800 align:middle line:90%
it's really good.

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.340 align:middle line:84%
As you say, it's a system
that was laid out for that.

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And it did lay a nice foundation
to be able to explode upon,

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.660 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, in your download.

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:26.359 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:56:26.359 --> 00:56:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Absolutely.

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thought?

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:33.235 align:middle line:84%
>>RUDD: Well, I would
say embrace the shadow.

00:56:33.235 --> 00:56:35.900 align:middle line:90%


00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Open up the gift and
embody the siddhi.

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the process.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.170 align:middle line:90%
It's about embodiment.

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is about getting
the wisdom into our bodies.

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Into our physical DNA.

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.840 align:middle line:10%
And changing from inside
us through increased

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.883 align:middle line:10%
awareness of everything
that's going on inside us.

00:56:53.883 --> 00:56:54.466 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:54.466 --> 00:56:54.966 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:54.966 --> 00:56:58.889 align:middle line:84%
Now, can the viewers get your
book on places like Amazon?

00:56:58.889 --> 00:56:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Yeah.

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:01.694 align:middle line:84%
Book's on Amazon, everything
else is on genekeys.com.

00:57:01.694 --> 00:57:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
that's where I got it.

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.147 align:middle line:90%
OK, very good.

00:57:04.147 --> 00:57:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your time.

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.165 align:middle line:90%
And it is a beautiful work.

00:57:07.165 --> 00:57:08.402 align:middle line:90%
>>RUDD: Thank you very much.

00:57:08.402 --> 00:57:09.667 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely to be here.

00:57:09.667 --> 00:57:11.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, as
we just mentioned,

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:12.970 align:middle line:10%
you can find the
book, "The Gene Keys"

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:16.290 align:middle line:10%
at amazon.com or
at genekeys.com.

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:19.110 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:21.740 align:middle line:10%
on Gaiam TV in London.
