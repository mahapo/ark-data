>>ANDREA PERRON:
From my perspective,

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.180 align:middle line:84%
there are only two
important questions.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Is there something beyond
our mortal existence?

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Are we alone in the universe?

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.060 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:90%
He was looking into the future.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:90%
She was looking into the past.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Each one
was a ghost to the other.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just--

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And I could
interact and relate

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:84%
with the spirits in an
entirely different way.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.995 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But that
was also where

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
I had my first conscious
contact with extraterrestrials.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that I am
here with purpose and reason

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
at this specific time, and
so are all the rest of us.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say something
to you that I didn't intend

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:84%
to when I came here
to this studio today,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to say it because
I was just told to say it.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:09.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Andrea Perron has
been with me here several times

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.740 align:middle line:10%
on Gaia talking about her
early life with poltergeist.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.540 align:middle line:84%
There were some
amazing takeaways,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:84%
but today, she's bringing us
a more subtle but profound

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:84%
message, that the time has
arrived for us to embrace

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
that we're only one
species among many

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and we have more
help than we can even

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
imagine to grow
to the next level

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
if we will acknowledge it and
accept it, and so much more.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Andrea, it's so good
to see you again.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: You too.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.965 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Now, the
last series of books

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:38.175 align:middle line:10%
was a trilogy, "House of
Darkness, House of Light,"

00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:10%
and anyone who wants to
see that can go to the Gaia

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.400 align:middle line:10%
archives because I have
interviews with you

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.350 align:middle line:10%
on all of those.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But now we're going
to move on because one

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:84%
of the things we brought up
in that series of interviews

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.580 align:middle line:84%
is that you've also been
a lifelong experiencer

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.600 align:middle line:90%
and contactee.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So first, just a little tease
for people who don't already

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
know you about the fact that
your family's life story was

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:84%
the basis for the first film,
"The Conjuring," which scared

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:90%
the bejesus out of everybody.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Mm-hmm.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.758 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just
talk a little bit

00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:84%
about kind of what
that dynamic did

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and how it spun the rest
into motion for you.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRON: Well, you know as well
as I do that most of humanity

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:10%
is-- we're just
fear-based carbon units.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:84%
James Wan and those
producers working

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
around making "The
Conjuring," which

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
was based on the case
files of Ed and Lorraine

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Warren, the paranormal
investigators and researchers,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:90%
is about 5% accurate.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:84%
When James read my
books, he's like, uh, no.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hell no.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:90%
No, we cannot make this story.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:84%
This will blow people
right out of the theater.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Nobody will stay
to watch the movie.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was
they cherry-picked

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
the screenwriters, cherry-picked
the case files of the Warrens

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and my books, which I gave
them permission to do,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and they created
their own third story,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:84%
which they considered palatable
based on the method and formula

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.735 align:middle line:90%
of you know how Hollywood--

00:03:01.735 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hollywood, yeah.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a formula.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.063 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: They just, yeah.

00:03:04.063 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And if it sold before,
then it'll sell again.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But I'm grateful for the film,
"The Conjuring," not only

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
because it was
made with integrity

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and with enormous creativity,
but my story, my trilogy,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
"House of Darkness,
House of Light,"

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:84%
would absolutely be
languishing in obscurity along

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:84%
with a million other
books had it not been

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.182 align:middle line:90%
for that blockbuster film.

00:03:29.182 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
are some things

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.473 align:middle line:84%
that when I said there
were takeaways for me

00:03:32.473 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:90%
I still talk about with friends.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.220 align:middle line:84%
There were two
points in your books,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
two points that to
me never went away.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And one was that how
these entities working

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
from the other side that have
yet to release themselves

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:84%
into the next level, how
they work with the forces

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.380 align:middle line:90%
around, including electricity.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And that fascinated me
that when they manifested

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:84%
to attack your mom or
whatever they were doing,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:84%
your electric bills
would go up, the meter

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%
would be spinning, that
they're manifesting

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.627 align:middle line:90%
through the electrical universe.

00:04:02.627 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: And water.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And water.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I found
that fascinating.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:10%
The other one, I'm just
going to say it briefly,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.295 align:middle line:10%
we got a lot to talk
about, in your new book,

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:10%
"A Wonder to Behold," was
that your mother found herself

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:10%
looking into the
dimension in time

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:10%
with another woman in the
same place at the dining table

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.550 align:middle line:10%
with her family 100,
200 years before

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.230 align:middle line:10%
and that woman turned
and looked at her

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:10%
and they saw each
other through time.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was incredible.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
What happened was there were
two men sitting at the table

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and they had pewter steins
in front of them indicative

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
of the 1700s, being outlawed
in the 1800s as dinnerware.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And they were
sitting at the table,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and one man looked
into the parlor

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and saw my mother standing
on the hearthstone,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and he nudged the guy beside
him and pointed her out,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.822 align:middle line:90%
and she was the ghost.

00:04:52.822 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So that was her
moment of epiphany.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what's ironic.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: That was
like pshh, like we're

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
living in dimensions that are
literally able to integrate

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
even if it's just momentarily.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:90%
He was looking into the future.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.357 align:middle line:90%
She was looking into the past.

00:05:10.357 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Each one was
a ghost to the other.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just--

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a
woman at the table.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:90%
I forgot it was men.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the correction.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.923 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: She was cooking.

00:05:17.923 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Of course, she was.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because I knew
there was a woman in that room.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, but I just
found that fascinating

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
that it's all a
matter of perception

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
time-space continuum right?

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Right.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And dimensionality.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So those are just a couple
of takeaways for anyone

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
who wants to go and read
those books who has not.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into the whole
part that you brought up

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.443 align:middle line:84%
there of throughout this
time up through now.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
You're a different
kind of person.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.785 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: You came
from somewhere else,

00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
like some of my guests have,
and you talked about your life

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.100 align:middle line:90%
as a contactee and experiencer.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered if you'll
go back into that a bit

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:84%
and bring us forward
into everything

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.910 align:middle line:84%
we're going to discuss today,
why that started being shown

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:90%
to you at an early age?

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I think
that, and I think

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I'll always think
this, when we moved

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
to that farmhouse, that
original colonial farmhouse

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that I could
see into what some describe

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
as the fourth dimension,
spirit, it was disconcerting,

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:90%
but it was also comfortable.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:90%
It was familial and familiar.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It was the only
place I've ever lived

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:90%
in my life that felt like home.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the only permanent
place on this Earth for me.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As painful and
crazy as it was, it was home.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yeah, it was, and
I could interact and relate

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
with the spirits in an
entirely different way

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:90%
than my family could.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But that was also
where I had my first conscious

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.630 align:middle line:84%
contact with extraterrestrials,
and it was the most--

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
that was my paradigm shift,
my personal paradigm shift,

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.245 align:middle line:84%
and it happened 3 weeks
ago, 50 years ago.

00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.995 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: In October.

00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yeah, it was the
first year that we lived there,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:90%
and I was outside alone.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
how that happened.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Being the eldest of
five girls, I always

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:84%
had children, little
sisters tethered to me.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:90%
This was different.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
I was standing out in
the front yard by myself,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and an entire flotilla of ships
passed over the farmhouse.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, I say that that's my
first conscious contact

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:84%
because I feel absolutely
certain that I've

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:84%
known since I had any
self-awareness as a being

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.140 align:middle line:90%
that I was not from here.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I knew that there
was something different.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I was playing fake
it till you make it

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.190 align:middle line:90%
since the age of about 3.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I came into this world with an
innate ability to read music,

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:08.218 align:middle line:84%
to play musical instruments,
to read well above my--

00:08:08.218 --> 00:08:09.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Grade level?

00:08:09.135 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, I was reading
Emerson's essays when I was

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:90%
8 years old and absorbing it.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Whitman, Thoreau,
the metaphysical writers.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And I could talk to animals and
have them talk to me in a way

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:84%
that I understood everything
that they were saying

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.260 align:middle line:90%
or what their needs were.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.065 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to realize
that other people couldn't.

00:08:31.065 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And so that created
kind of a cognitive dissonance,

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:84%
kind of a disparate
separation for me

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.340 align:middle line:84%
where I felt very
much alone, but I

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:84%
used that alone time to
start to go a little deeper

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
into my own consciousness
and to explore it

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:90%
because it's a whole universe.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for that, Andrea.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, we just
stopped shooting for a second

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.253 align:middle line:84%
and have a little edit
here because every time you

00:09:00.253 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
come here, watch us
stop, lights blow,

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and there's a contingent
of beings around us

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.530 align:middle line:84%
that people are not going to
be able to see with their eyes,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:90%
but they're here.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.330 align:middle line:90%
You can feel them.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.280 align:middle line:90%
And so strange stuff happens.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So we have to stop a lot and do
little edits as our lights blow

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.090 align:middle line:90%
and audio goes out.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:90%
So we're back.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: We're back.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now,
what I'd like to say

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.980 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, so you have that
whole universe inside you,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and in your book,
"Wonder to Behold,"

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the fact that
this started precipitating

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
the need for almost a new kind
of language among humanity,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.970 align:middle line:84%
people that were starting
to have these experiences,

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the work of Dr. John
Mack and others.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have to
create a whole new language

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate that we may
not be the only species

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And you say, a
couple of those words

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:90%
are like star seed and empath.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is to express
what's beyond the 5D world.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that a little bit
and what you started learning

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.257 align:middle line:90%
from that point forward.

00:09:58.257 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, I think
that what's happened

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:84%
is we've had to
expand the vernacular.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: We've literally had
to create an extended language

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate our spiritual
growth and our understanding

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.470 align:middle line:84%
as it burgeons about the
oneness, the realization

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:90%
of oneness of consciousness.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I refer to it in two
different ways in the book,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
as higher love
and light language

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
where words no longer have
the same relevance in terms

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:90%
of communication.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And because I had
that experience

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:84%
as a 13-year-old child,
and I just turned 63,

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I am 50 years into
this journey now.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:10%
That it happened at the
farm, and that I as a child

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:10%
thought I was literally the only
person on Earth that just saw

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:10%
what I saw, which was
not only one vessel

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.670 align:middle line:10%
but an entire
flotilla of vessels

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:10%
pass over that property,
I know I had lost time.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I know everything went
completely silent, even

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:90%
birdsong--

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: --gone.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Common
to experiencers.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: But I didn't know.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:90%
I was a child.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't
know any of it, yeah.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And God knows there
was not that much out there.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't just run
down to the library

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and start pulling
out books on UFOs.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:90%
They weren't written yet.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, my
sisters, when I

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
was writing "House of Darkness,
House of Light," they said,

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.838 align:middle line:84%
please don't talk about
your little friends.

00:11:40.838 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, why did they
find that so difficult

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.430 align:middle line:84%
when everything else
that was going on?

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, why did they
find that difficult?

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: The logical question,
which I asked was, oh,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.735 align:middle line:84%
so you think I'll be taken
more seriously writing about

00:11:52.735 --> 00:11:53.535 align:middle line:90%
spirit--

00:11:53.535 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead
of poltergeist?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --and
ghosts, dead people

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:84%
than talking about the
sentient, prescient

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:84%
beings that are circumnavigating
this globe in numbers

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
that we can't even
wrap our minds around.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And you think I'll be taken
more seriously writing

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:84%
about dead people
than living beings

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
who are here to help us with our
forward momentum as a species.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:90%
And their answer was, yes.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.702 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well,
you ignored them.

00:12:25.702 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank goodness.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, no,
I didn't actually.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing at all
about extraterrestrials

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:90%
in the trilogy.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
and I talked about it.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I wrote a
whole entire book.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and I
talked about it on camera

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.695 align:middle line:90%
after it was released.

00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, we did.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There was
nothing in that.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.113 align:middle line:90%
I left it out.

00:12:39.113 --> 00:12:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Even though
they were absolutely

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.020 align:middle line:90%
correlated and integrated.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:84%
But then five years
later, I wrote "A Wonder

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:84%
To Behold," which
encompasses and incorporates

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.720 align:middle line:84%
all of my experiences
as a contactee.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.615 align:middle line:90%
And this is really--

00:12:55.615 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be interviewing
another woman tomorrow, two

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
other women that are mediums to
beings on the other side who've

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.590 align:middle line:84%
passed over and
communications between people.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And one thing they say, which
is very relevant to what

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about and
I talked about in the open

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:84%
is that we are surrounded by
beings interdimensionally that

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:90%
are here to watch, to assist.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
To be able to help
us cognitively

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.692 align:middle line:84%
even, and spiritually
and emotionally.

00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Just like what's in
the studio right now,

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.230 align:middle line:84%
you bring a contingent
of them with you.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.090 align:middle line:84%
I always dial in
before the interview

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:90%
and they're everywhere.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I thought, man, this
place is crowded.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're all here and
we all have them around us

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:90%
to help us lift into something.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the nature
of this multidimensional

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:84%
universe and these beings from
other places, what they're here

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:84%
to help us learn and do
from your perspective now.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, I do travel
with my own security detail.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:84%
That's a fact, especially so
at 30,000 feet and my mother

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.087 align:middle line:90%
worries constantly.

00:14:06.087 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:90%
She's like, you travel too much.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:90%
You're on planes.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, mom, I'm in the
safest seat in the sky, OK?

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's going to happen to me.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I came to
the realization

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:90%
that I am here on a mission.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I came to the realization
that I have a job to do.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.950 align:middle line:84%
That I'm part of
the ground crew.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But even though I understand
now that I am in this place,

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:90%
I am not of this place.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:84%
If you were, you wouldn't
be blowing our light, so.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Right.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's get into
these multidimensional species

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Just a plethora of
third dimensional

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:84%
species also within
the universe that

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.940 align:middle line:84%
are capable of projecting
themselves here

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:90%
through technology.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And your interaction with them,
and what they're asking of you.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
offering humanity.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: They're not really
offering humanity anything,

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:90%
but enlightenment.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.610 align:middle line:90%
They can't do it for us.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the shortest
chapter in my new book.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.430 align:middle line:90%
It's also the most profound.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:84%
It's called The
Chicken and The Egg.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And about four or
five years ago,

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd been writing a screenplay,
working very late at night.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:90%
I went to bed.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And I normally go out between
2:30, 3 o'clock in the morning

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and speak with my Galactic
family, sing to them.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:84%
That's how I interact
with them through song.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.970 align:middle line:90%
But not that night, I was tired.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And I went to bed.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
I got a nudge.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Like a physical nudge, get up.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was the middle
of January in Florida,

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:90%
I was freezing to death.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was like no,
no, not tonight.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Not tonight.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.492 align:middle line:90%
And then I got a push, come out.

00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
why they couldn't

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:84%
do what they did while I
was still in the house,

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
but I went outside and I was
aggravated because I had to put

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:90%
my slippers on and a robe.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:90%
You know, Florida.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An
inconvenience, yeah.

00:16:11.295 --> 00:16:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And I went out to the
middle of the driveway

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and I just looked up
and I said, what is it?

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
a light, 1,000 times

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:84%
brighter than the one
that's focused on me

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:90%
right now went off here.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was suddenly
12 years old again.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I was back with my
mother and my sisters

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and my father at a chicken
farm in Connecticut

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:84%
close to the border where
our farm was in Rhode Island.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And the farmer's wife had
taken all of us into an area

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.750 align:middle line:84%
where they were allowing some
of the chicks to be born.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
long incubator,

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:84%
I guess for lack of
another word where

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:90%
all the eggs were separated.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing there and a
couple of them were moving.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.619 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw this tiny
little beak come pop through

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and I went over to crush the
egg, to release the baby chick.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And my mother gently pulled my
hand back and she said, oh, no,

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.520 align:middle line:84%
honey, you can't crack the
egg, because if you do,

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:90%
the baby will die.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:90%
I was mortified.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Through sheer ignorance
I almost claimed the life

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.670 align:middle line:84%
of a baby chick
because I didn't know

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.265 align:middle line:84%
better until my mother
taught me that lesson.

00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is a
metaphor for humanity.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: That was the metaphor.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
gave me that night.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I didn't see
anything moving in the sky.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I did not have any kind of
visible contact with a vessel.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I got that instant
of that message.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And I went back in and
I opened up my computer

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and I sat and I wrote
the treatise, The Chicken

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and The Egg.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, what I needed
to relearn from a lesson

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that I learned well as a
12-year-old was that you

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.920 align:middle line:84%
can help someone so much
that they can no longer help

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what I came to by having
them give that long forgotten

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
lesson a reboot in sole
school where the test always

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.020 align:middle line:90%
precedes the lesson was--

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain that.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: The amount
of energy that

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
is required for that baby
chick to peck its way out

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.850 align:middle line:84%
of its three dimensional
shell is equivalent

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
the amount of
energy and strength

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:84%
that will require to exist
on the outside of the shell.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you do the work
for it, it will perish.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:90%
And that is our lesson.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:90%
And that was the message.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
beautiful metaphor.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Very apropos.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So now, we look at some
of the-- as you say,

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.720 align:middle line:84%
what's being offered is a
chance for enlightenment.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And that means many
things to many people,

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:90%
but it means to wake up.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It does.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Many beings from many
dimensions that we call guides,

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:84%
they can be ETs, they can be
interdimensional are here.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And they are there for the
asking, asking for help.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And really it's up to us to come
to that dawn of awakening where

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:84%
we're ready to ask
for what we need

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
to make this transition
to this higher awareness.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us has to go
through that in our own time

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and peck our way
out of that shell.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And once we have,
there are beings galore

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle line:90%
waiting to help us.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: And here they are.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.357 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And here they are.

00:19:38.357 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about the
fact that these species

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:90%
may have created us.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of these species may have
even been partly our creators.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I see it in a very
similar way, certainly,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:90%
tweaked us in the beginning.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.792 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:90%
This is hard for some people.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: This is very
hard for a lot of people

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:90%
because our belief system--

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even atheists
have a belief system.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:84%
They believe there is
no such thing as God.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Our belief systems,
I think function

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:84%
as the jet fuel for our
cognitive development.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:90%
We rely on them.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:90%
It's what makes sense to us.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It's what we are indoctrinated
in at usually a very early age.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And most people either
grow with it or outgrow it.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:90%
But it becomes a part of us.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
reasons why I've

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
heard from inside the
community of people

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:84%
who research UFOs, UAPs,
whatever you want to call them,

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:90%
I call them my Galactic family.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:84%
They say the reason that
disclosure is not occurring

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:90%
is because of the fear.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Again, fear that it will
fracture belief systems

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and it will undo
the power structure.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.790 align:middle line:84%
What the real fear
is, is that the power

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:84%
structure and the
people that perceive

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:90%
themselves to be in control.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is in control.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But they think
they're in control.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I consider it
disingenuous for them

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
to say that they're
concerned that humanity

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:90%
can't handle this.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we can.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.517 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need
them for disclosure.

00:21:27.517 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's already happened.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It's already happened.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And we are the
point of disclosure.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:84%
You and me and countless
others who have

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:84%
had the experiences, and
who are courageous enough

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:84%
to speak our truth regardless
of the consequences for it.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I have no fear of
the government.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I have no fear of any
single individual that

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.950 align:middle line:84%
might find what I am
saying disconcerting,

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.810 align:middle line:90%
because I am the light.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I have learned through my
experiences as a child.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I have seen the dark
side of existence.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:90%
I learned to live in the light.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It repels anything that is
evil or negative from me.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And all of us, if I'm
capable of that, all of us

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:90%
are capable of that.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I have no fear in terms
of recounting my stories,

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.360 align:middle line:90%
my experiences.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:90%
They're far more than stories.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.200 align:middle line:84%
What I need to
implore people to do

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:90%
is to go within and look within.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:10%
And if COVID gave us a
gift, it was that time

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:10%
to feel the ground
beneath our feet

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.200 align:middle line:10%
and the grasp between
our toes and take

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:10%
a few moments to look up
into this boundless ever

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.240 align:middle line:10%
expanding universe.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.710 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective, there are
only two important questions

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:84%
for us on this plane
of action at this time.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:84%
One is, is there something
beyond our mortal existence?

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Are we alone in the universe?

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's incumbent
upon us now in terms

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.600 align:middle line:84%
of our own spiritual evolution
to determine who we are,

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:90%
where we come from.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Why we are here and
what is our purpose.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And I truly believe
there's a huge quantum leap

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.740 align:middle line:90%
between belief and knowledge.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
I am coming from a
place of knowledge,

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:84%
but I do believe that I am
here with purpose and reason

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:90%
at this specific time.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:90%
And so are all the rest of us.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So that we can literally find
our way out of the darkness

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:90%
into the light.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Find our way to a higher
level of consciousness,

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:90%
to higher love.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:84%
To a deeper understanding
of the purpose of our being.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:84%
We're not just here
to live and die

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and keep a roof over our
heads and make money.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:90%
It's much greater than that.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:90%
It is entirely spiritual.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Most communication
is telepathic.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.340 align:middle line:84%
It's all about consciousness,
and the realization of oneness.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.780 align:middle line:90%
And when we reach that point--

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I'm here--

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
when we reach the point
that we understand

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.240 align:middle line:84%
that everything is energy,
that everything is one thing.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:84%
That existence is shared,
and that we are all here

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:84%
to support each other,
then perhaps that

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:84%
will be the turning point where
we stop mutilating each other

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and killing the planet
that we live on.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm
here with you today.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's the
message of "The House of Light."

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's go
to "The House of Darkness"

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Because we have these
interfaces with various species,

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:90%
many, many different species.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:84%
You have your Galactic family,
other people have theirs,

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:90%
and then you've got marauders.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.543 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have a
little bit of everything.

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:13.320 align:middle line:84%
This is a vast universe,
and this planet

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.950 align:middle line:90%
is of great interest.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So for a moment let's
talk about technology,

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.152 align:middle line:90%
you know, seeding of technology.

00:25:20.152 --> 00:25:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview with
John Warner the fourth.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.570 align:middle line:84%
His dad was John
Warner the third,

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:90%
who was a five-time Senator.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And he's talked about growing
up among these circles that

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.470 align:middle line:90%
have kind of hierarchy to it.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.220 align:middle line:84%
He said but what people don't
understand is that the top,

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:84%
we think it's just
a cast of humans.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:84%
At the very top of the
hierarchy actually is ET,

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:90%
and that was his statement.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
At the very top that kind
of runs this show even.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's
disconcerting to people,

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:84%
unless your best interest
is at heart, right?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Right.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So let's get into the
technological part of the game

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:10%
because you have said
this time is critical,

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.660 align:middle line:10%
because we can do exactly
what you just spoke of,

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.230 align:middle line:10%
which is time to understand
our purpose here and move

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:10%
into the light, own light in
each one of us and together.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you have another agenda
playing out at the same time.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need
to talk about it.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: We do.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there are ETs
attached to that one as well.

00:26:15.215 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, there are.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.660 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier,
I already believe

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:90%
that disclosure has occurred.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I think people are handling it
very well for the most part.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.717 align:middle line:90%
I mean, when I look--

00:26:27.717 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Churches may not like
it, but people are doing fine.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: People are doing fine.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that it's
fracturing people's belief

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think
it's solidifying them.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And the power brokers
who really only seek

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:90%
to protect their own power.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:10%
That's really all
they care about,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:10%
the common denominator
being greed.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Power and
profit, that's it.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There needs to
be a crisis of conscience

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:84%
They somehow think they
can take it with them.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.747 align:middle line:84%
That's the most shocking
thing of all to me.

00:27:02.747 --> 00:27:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't understand that.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I cannot
comprehend it.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I can't wrap my mind around
so much of what's going on.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
The cognitive
dissonance, the shredding

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:84%
of what Dolores Cannon
referred to as the shredding

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:21.470 align:middle line:90%
of old and new Earth.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:90%
There is so much.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:27.080 align:middle line:84%
We are at a pivotal time in
the evolution of humanity.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.577 align:middle line:84%
And we could just as easily
fail as succeed here.

00:27:30.577 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the influences that

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.010 align:middle line:84%
take us down the road of
technology versus spirit.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And everyone watching
this understands

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.930 align:middle line:84%
how this is playing out in the
world to one degree or another.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how you
understand it playing out,

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:90%
AI being part of it.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's a complex subject.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It is a
complex subject.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:58.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's also simplistic in
that this was inevitable.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.080 align:middle line:84%
There was going to
come a point where--

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:08.030 align:middle line:84%
first of all, let's
dispel some fear here, OK?

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:13.390 align:middle line:84%
If Steven Hawking's
final treatise said,

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
yes, they're here but
don't talk to them.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
their intentions are.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much what he left
us with prior to his death.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:84%
That was disappointing
to me because that

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.500 align:middle line:90%
was fear-based as well.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:84%
If he had spoken
with them, then he

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.510 align:middle line:84%
would know that they
posed no threat.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:84%
The thing that upsets
me and angers me

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:84%
is that the military industrial
complex that Eisenhower warned

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:84%
us about is coming
to full fruition

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:50.800 align:middle line:84%
now in terms of
vilifying and creating

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.410 align:middle line:90%
a threat that does not exist.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I saw the footage
from the Nimitz.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:10%
They were playing with us.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.162 align:middle line:84%
They were making
their presence known.

00:28:59.162 --> 00:29:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not a threat.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.245 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: That's all that--

00:29:01.245 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:90%
no threat.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, and here's the
thing, here's the logic.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.130 align:middle line:90%
They've been here forever.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.130 align:middle line:84%
If they wanted to
enslave us, they

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.450 align:middle line:84%
could have done
it millennia ago.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
lecture about this,

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I usually have my smartphone
sitting off to the side

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.020 align:middle line:90%
with a couple of notes in it.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I pick up my
phone and say, gee,

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.470 align:middle line:90%
how enslaved do you feel?

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Your face is always
buried in this.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Put it down.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Look up.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:35.620 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is a tool.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It is not the main
focus of your life.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Facebook is not the end all
be all of your existence.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Please, put this
down and look up.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Go to the ocean, feel the sand
get trapped between your toes.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Feel the clouds and
the wind above you.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Become integrated with
this beautiful place

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.920 align:middle line:84%
before it perishes
from existence.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And we will be the ones
responsible for that.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:90%
It is very disconcerting to me.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And I spend a great deal of
time in reflection, anxiety,

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
sometimes depression
because I realized

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:84%
that we are on the precipice
of our own destruction.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, my
darling, Regina, I

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.380 align:middle line:84%
don't have that much
faith in humanity.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you know what
was interesting, Andrea, COVID.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember because
I went out during COVID.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:84%
The whole time, I
was out every day.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.250 align:middle line:90%
I never stayed home.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:84%
I was out going somewhere every
day and watching the world.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was on a four-lane
freeway and sometimes would

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.950 align:middle line:90%
be the only car in the morning.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:47.720 align:middle line:90%
It was surreal.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But what we all noticed is
everything started coming back.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.950 align:middle line:90%
The skies started clearing.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The animals started
coming back into--

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:90%
coming out to play.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Coming into neighborhoods again.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.660 align:middle line:84%
All these wonderful incidences
of fish repopulating in certain

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.620 align:middle line:90%
streams even.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that has to do a lot
with the lack of air traffic,

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:90%
we won't get into that.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, Earth
has plenty creative.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.920 align:middle line:90%
She can fix herself in a flash.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:90%
Look how short that window was.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: That short
window allowed for a hole

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:90%
over the Arctic to close.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes that's how
creative the Earth is.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And people
living in India

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.900 align:middle line:84%
could see the Himalayas for
the first time in their lives.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wasn't
that amazing, though?

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Everything stopped and we
got to see who she was.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:39.910 align:middle line:84%
This incredible
creativity in re birthing.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:43.270 align:middle line:84%
But it also gave some
people pause for thought,

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.700 align:middle line:84%
do we want to go down that
road we were on before?

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, it
was the great pause.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And so now those
same forces that

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.992 align:middle line:84%
were there before that profit
from all of this and profit

00:31:52.992 --> 00:31:55.450 align:middle line:84%
from fear, which we're going
to get into in just a moment--

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: They're still there.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're still
there, and they're still

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.320 align:middle line:90%
going to try to exploit.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But look at what's happening,
the great resignation

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.130 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:04.672 align:middle line:84%
People are saying,
I don't to be part

00:32:04.672 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:90%
of these stupid jobs anymore.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be part
of the machine anymore.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:84%
There is a consciousness
that's happening.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I'm a little
more optimistic

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.430 align:middle line:90%
about what humans might become.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:90%
What we might choose.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.110 align:middle line:90%
You might be less optimistic.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It's not that
I'm less optimistic.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
running out of time.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.770 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm so
disgusted right now

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:30.790 align:middle line:84%
is that the climate thing
going on, the blah, blah, blah,

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.720 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.580 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Somebody needed to
invite me into that room.

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you what, talk
about a come to Jesus meeting,

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you from
the Jesus meeting--

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The interesting thing
is you and others who have had

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.280 align:middle line:84%
contact experience over
and over and over again--

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed so many
people and read so many books--

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.208 align:middle line:90%
are shown the same thing.

00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:55.250 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take care
of this beautiful planet.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.320 align:middle line:84%
We're all here because
we're interested in it.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.790 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to help you protect
it to the degree they can

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.400 align:middle line:84%
or they can interfere
or not help, whatever.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
this message of you

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:84%
need to take care of your
host, this beautiful planet

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.930 align:middle line:90%
over and over.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: We're the only
animal on this planet that

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.220 align:middle line:90%
fouls its own nest.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.580 align:middle line:84%
We are the pestilence
on this planet.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps this massive
die off that is occurring

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.850 align:middle line:84%
is happening with greater
purpose and reason

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:32.800 align:middle line:84%
because it is a wake up
call in its own right.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.880 align:middle line:90%
We must, must get control.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And control isn't
even the right word.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:84%
We must come into
a greater awareness

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.050 align:middle line:84%
that we are all
correlated and integrated.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.020 align:middle line:84%
That each one of
us is a filament

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:55.310 align:middle line:84%
in a bizarre
complicated tapestry.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And that every time
one of those filaments

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:05.360 align:middle line:84%
is yanked from this piece of
artwork, it alters the artwork.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
the way that it is.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.330 align:middle line:90%
We can live in continuity.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.810 align:middle line:84%
We can live in peace
with our environment.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.010 align:middle line:90%
We can even--

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.130 align:middle line:84%
The thing that
aggravates me so much

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:84%
is the people that
say, well, we need

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.760 align:middle line:84%
to develop new technologies
so that we can clean the air

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.179 align:middle line:84%
and we can desalinate the
ocean as everything melts

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have all
this extra-- we already have all

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.239 align:middle line:90%
the technology that we need.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.449 align:middle line:84%
And the power structure
has buried it in a vault

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and thrown away the key
until they can figure out

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.630 align:middle line:90%
a way to monetize it.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.969 align:middle line:84%
That's what keeps
me up at night.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:47.270 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes
my head blow off.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:53.389 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that's where I fail
to have faith in humanity.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Not the common
human being that's

00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:00.860 align:middle line:84%
just trying to get by from day
to day and raise their family,

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and give their children
a better chance.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:09.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the ones that are in
control as they perceive it.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Who are seeking to
the climate meeting.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:16.370 align:middle line:84%
There was no we need
to reverse course now.

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:84%
It came out, we need to
cut down on our coal use.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it was all over--
all in all, it was pathetic.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:25.910 align:middle line:84%
They should have saved the
fuel on their private jets

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:27.200 align:middle line:90%
to get there and stayed home.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: That's right.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.220 align:middle line:90%
It was a waste of time.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:90%
It was a joke.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.276 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was a joke.

00:35:29.276 --> 00:35:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It was a shame
on you moment for humanity.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I am so unimpressed.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what, I'm
going to say something

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:40.970 align:middle line:84%
to you that I didn't intend to
when I came here to the studio

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.470 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:47.940 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to say it because
I was just told to say it.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Since I was a child, I have
been having the same recurring

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.940 align:middle line:90%
dream.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
what the setting was

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:58.350 align:middle line:90%
when I began having this dream.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.740 align:middle line:90%
I was probably four or five.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And the building
actually turned out,

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I found out later to be
the United Nations General

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Assembly.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in this room but
not visible in my dream.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And the dream is always
exactly the same, always.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And through the ceiling
comes floating down

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:32.120 align:middle line:84%
into the center of this
room of predominantly men.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.065 align:middle line:90%
And it's she.

00:36:33.065 --> 00:36:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:41.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a non-physical entity,
a form, a white light.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:43.610 align:middle line:90%
But I know it's female.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And she drops down into
the center of the room

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:90%
and she spins.

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And everyone goes silent,
completely silent.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.590 align:middle line:84%
What she's doing
while she's spinning

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is she's speaking to each one
of them in their own language.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And what she is
saying that I can hear

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:84%
is that we love you
and we honor you,

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:84%
but the decision has
been made that humanity

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.490 align:middle line:90%
is a failed experiment.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And so from this point
on, you will no longer

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.190 align:middle line:90%
be able to reproduce.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.940 align:middle line:90%
We love you and we honor you.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And your species will go on
elsewhere at another time.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And then she retracts
from the room.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And you've had this
your whole life?

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.878 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: My whole life.

00:37:30.878 --> 00:37:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we know what's
happening with fertility

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:90%
rates on the planet.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, we do.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the replacement
population is already

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:38.900 align:middle line:90%
starting to decrease.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And certainly in
the Western world.

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:90%
And so it might be that was--

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:84%
well appears it
was quite prescient

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and has held up in terms of
bearing out in statistically

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:90%
even in the world today.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And so then we have
to look at this thing

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:03.170 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned a little while
ago, what Dolores Cannon said.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is the same thing I
was told now almost 40 years ago

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.740 align:middle line:90%
by my family of beings.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is it was
always known that time

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.170 align:middle line:84%
would come when the diversity
of consciousness on the planet

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:19.490 align:middle line:84%
would be so great that the
two general groups of people

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:22.340 align:middle line:84%
would not benefit from living
side by side any longer.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was learning
baby lessons,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.120 align:middle line:90%
which is you don't torture.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.130 align:middle line:90%
You don't steal, you don't rape.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.170 align:middle line:84%
These are basic
kindergarten lessons

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.600 align:middle line:84%
versus people who are embracing
and trying to figure out

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:84%
how to lift their frequencies
and their knowledge base

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and live in peace, and
harmony with one another.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.110 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't work
well together anymore.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said there has been
another creation all along,

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:84%
another Earth that
has been created

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.750 align:middle line:84%
over a very long period
of time for this time

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to take the inhabitants
of Earth and the Earth

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.550 align:middle line:84%
experiment,
inadvertent experiment

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and give each their own
place and their own domain

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.420 align:middle line:90%
among like-minded beings.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So that the evolution
can happen more quickly.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.250 align:middle line:84%
This is very similar to what
Dolores Cannon's people call,

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:10.770 align:middle line:84%
what you call and you've seen as
well, this shredding of the two

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Earths.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
because for me now

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm a glass half-full person.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I see that as, OK, we're
at the shredding point.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.920 align:middle line:90%
That's happening.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But there is no reason if
the shredding continues

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness continues
rising upward on Earth that we

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:90%
can't have a renewed Earth.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.025 align:middle line:90%
And a renewed species.

00:39:32.025 --> 00:39:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Absolutely.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I feel
that you and I are both

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:37.760 align:middle line:90%
doing our good work.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't just wake up and
then not do anything about it.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to put
feet on the ground,

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and we are part of
the ground crew.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.190 align:middle line:84%
You and I have a very
specific job to do.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And many others, very much
like us, millions of people

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:90%
are contactees.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't need
anyone in authority

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.390 align:middle line:84%
to tell us that we are
not alone in the universe.

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:06.410 align:middle line:84%
We are the credible people
with incredible experiences

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:08.480 align:middle line:90%
that we are willing to share.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So you can either
believe us or not.

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:13.730 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to
convince or coerce anyone,

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.650 align:middle line:84%
but when we get to
the point when we

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.480 align:middle line:90%
can no longer hear each other.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
the disparate factions.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can't hear
each other anymore.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Can't hear
each other, all we can do

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.750 align:middle line:90%
is shout each other down.

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:90%
All we can do is argue.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.290 align:middle line:84%
All we can do is
trigger and fight,

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:29.402 align:middle line:90%
and anger is the trigger.

00:40:29.402 --> 00:40:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.840 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about the role--

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.100 align:middle line:90%
we have the role of fear.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, fear informs,
it doesn't form.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It does.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:39.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It helps us--
let's talk about fear

00:40:39.245 --> 00:40:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and forming before
we go to faith.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Because believe it
or not, we didn't

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:90%
get to half the stuff as usual.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.080 align:middle line:90%
We're almost out of time.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I know.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
fear and how fear informs us.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:53.272 align:middle line:84%
And if we're in fear what
we can learn from that fear.

00:40:53.272 --> 00:40:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I think that
we are fear-based carbon

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:56.760 align:middle line:90%
units for a reason.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And as our DNA restructures and
with crystalline light, which

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:01.540 align:middle line:90%
is happening.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you see it,
but I see the light grid.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.500 align:middle line:90%
They're all around us.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.200 align:middle line:90%
They are just pshh.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like passive
aggressive behavior going on.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I know, I hear you.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:19.710 align:middle line:84%
That they're helping
and yet not interfering.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to
have the awareness.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.960 align:middle line:84%
But fear does play
a function in it.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that as I travel
around the country and even

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:84%
the world, I try to implore
people to think about

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.590 align:middle line:90%
is that fear is a tool.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.460 align:middle line:90%
It is a function.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:90%
It is an emotion.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you relinquish
your personal power to it,

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:42.900 align:middle line:90%
you live a half life.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rather than
letting it simply inform

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:46.260 align:middle line:90%
you of what needs attention.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It is that
little tap on the shoulder,

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.490 align:middle line:90%
don't get in that car with him.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Don't go down that alley.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It's your visceral
instinctive warning system.

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:03.330 align:middle line:84%
But when you turn over
you're being to it, then

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.250 align:middle line:90%
it ceases to be a tool.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:08.790 align:middle line:84%
It begins to manipulate
your own consciousness.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Love is the answer to
every single question.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Higher love can be
attained by connecting

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.970 align:middle line:90%
with the Galactic family.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:84%
When you get to that point,
and you're struggling every day

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:27.030 align:middle line:84%
to swim against the current
in this thing called

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:32.190 align:middle line:84%
life, what we need to do
is just embrace that fear.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank it.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Thank it for every
single time it ever

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:37.140 align:middle line:90%
saved you from yourself--

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:37.446 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:42:37.446 --> 00:42:38.246 align:middle line:90%
Gave us the alert--

00:42:38.246 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --from making
a horrible decision.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And just embrace it.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so,
you dis-empower it.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so, instead of
swimming against the current,

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:90%
you flip over and float.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Because what humanity has
yet to ascertain but is

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.630 align:middle line:84%
the truth at the
core of everything

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:01.410 align:middle line:84%
is that the journey
itself is the destination,

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:04.368 align:middle line:90%
and the universe knows the way.

00:43:04.368 --> 00:43:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does know the way.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.770 align:middle line:90%
We know the way.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Our highest being, our
highest aspect of self

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:10.850 align:middle line:90%
does know the way.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.260 align:middle line:90%
We just don't listen.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Can we
just learn that.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can we listen.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Can we embrace that and listen.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.013 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:43:20.013 --> 00:43:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about faith
for just a moment

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:27.323 align:middle line:84%
before we say goodbye,
because that is an essential--

00:43:27.323 --> 00:43:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Every
time I'm with you.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.550 align:middle line:90%
I know you get verklempt.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I do.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I can't help it.

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about faith.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:37.973 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
where faith comes in.

00:43:37.973 --> 00:43:40.650 align:middle line:84%
We let fear inform us,
faith is a different thing

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:42.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have to bring
all of ourselves

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to the table to
say I have faith.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's not blind faith.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:84%
It's actual faith
in the principles

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.200 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.480 align:middle line:90%
These things do win in the end.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It takes time maybe,
but as we continue

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.840 align:middle line:84%
to develop these
aspects of ourself

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.060 align:middle line:90%
that are moving into the light.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And I mean the light in
the true sense of the word.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.723 align:middle line:84%
Then this game is
going to change.

00:44:05.723 --> 00:44:07.140 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
change for the good.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
change for the good.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
have faith in times

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.210 align:middle line:90%
that look chaotic and dark.

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Talk about faith for a moment.

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It's what
keeps me going.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.580 align:middle line:84%
It's what gets me
up every morning

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.370 align:middle line:84%
as I take a cup of coffee
out onto the terrace

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and I say thank you for coming.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:30.390 align:middle line:84%
If we can hold gratitude in
our hearts for each other

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and for the beauty of this
universe that we dwell within,

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:42.500 align:middle line:84%
we are beginning to ascertain
who we are, where we come from,

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and why we are here.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.410 align:middle line:90%
These are eternal questions.

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying
we're supposed

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.970 align:middle line:84%
to have the answer to
every mystery of life.

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's OK
to just have faith

00:44:56.020 --> 00:45:00.250 align:middle line:84%
that the mystery has
intrinsically an answer.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.200 align:middle line:84%
That we might not get this
time around in soul school.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's OK.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It's OK.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.040 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's that driving force
that keeps us curious.

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:11.200 align:middle line:90%
That keeps us fascinated.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, keeps
us on our spiritual ascension.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:20.470 align:middle line:84%
If we can maintain
that forward momentum,

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:24.730 align:middle line:84%
this global wave of
consciousness raising,

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:29.440 align:middle line:84%
the rising to the occasion
of the paradigm shift

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:36.190 align:middle line:84%
will be enough to lift us up out
of the morass of the darkness

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and bring humanity
into the light.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And I have to
maintain that faith

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.100 align:middle line:84%
or I wouldn't want
to be here anymore.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you probably
wouldn't be here honestly

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.570 align:middle line:84%
because you've had your
little close calls.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So and again, I think
for every one of us,

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.400 align:middle line:84%
the antidote is almost always
the intrinsic beauty of nature

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:58.790 align:middle line:90%
and mother Earth herself.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And I just love
that COVID window

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:04.630 align:middle line:84%
where she just started healing
and dancing and expressing

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:05.800 align:middle line:90%
herself in joy.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.510 align:middle line:90%
And so for us to do the same.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:09.790 align:middle line:84%
To enjoy the Earth,
to appreciate her.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, get a little
bit of sand between your toes.

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Sit under a tree.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that right
now that will along

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:84%
with having faith that we
can guard ourselves forward

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.810 align:middle line:84%
is the most beautiful thing
we can do for all concerned.

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: As we observe the
external, we internalize.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:30.760 align:middle line:10%
And in those moments
where we close our eyes

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.140 align:middle line:10%
and just say what is that?

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.260 align:middle line:84%
We understand that the
light is within each

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.130 align:middle line:90%
and every one of us.

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:40.980 align:middle line:90%
Andrea, thank you so much.

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry that
I make you cry

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:47.760 align:middle line:84%
or our conversations make you
cry, but I expect that now.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.228 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, thank you.

00:46:50.228 --> 00:46:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for hanging in there.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for continuing
to have faith.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.030 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing that dream.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.658 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I have never
told anybody about that.

00:46:58.658 --> 00:47:00.408 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for sharing the dream.

00:47:00.408 --> 00:47:02.100 align:middle line:84%
It may not be a
pleasant thing to hear,

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.020 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't mean it's
the end of the world.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: No, it's
a forewarning.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: That's what it is.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so thank
you for sharing it

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.650 align:middle line:84%
because it's been persistent
throughout your life.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, until
the next book.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.972 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, ma'am.

00:47:14.972 --> 00:47:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Andrea's new book is
titled "A Wonder To Behold,"

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and goes deeper into every
single thing we spoke of.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we have a couple
of other lively discussions

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:24.810 align:middle line:84%
in the Gaia archives
you can enjoy.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:28.230 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
