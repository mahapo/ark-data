00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.950 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: I have
Dr. Zach Bush with me today.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.870 align:middle line:10%
We met at the
GaiaSphere event, where

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:10%
I was very intrigued
by what he had

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:10%
to say about how our food
supply is affecting our hormones

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:10%
and sexuality.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:84%
By extension, this would affect
our relationships in large part

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
because of the commercial
agriculture practices

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:90%
we're being exposed to.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Big circle of events.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.680 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to Zach.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you with me, Zach.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ZACH BUSH: Regina, it's a
pleasure to be here with you.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I have wanted
to interview you for years.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.392 align:middle line:84%
So your background
is interesting.

00:00:47.392 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Some people already
know your background.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Some people do not.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:84%
You were practicing mainstream
medicine earlier in your career

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and even through cancer
therapies, things which now you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:84%
just think, oh my
god, what was I doing?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your
transition from, oh my god,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:84%
what was I doing, to
where you are now.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:10%
>>BUSH: Yeah, for 17 years,
in academic medicine training

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.410 align:middle line:10%
and then practice and
the like and working

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:10%
in large-scale tertiary
university hospital

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.440 align:middle line:10%
systems and the like.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:10%
And my cell biology
work was ultimately

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:10%
working in this interface
between metabolism,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:10%
the way in which the body
creates energy, and how cancer

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:10%
occurs, which is really a
collapse of our capacity

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:10%
to create energy in the cell.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I was studying
in that space,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
developing novel chemotherapy
in the areas of nutrients rather

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
than poisons, and
in that process

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:84%
started to realize
that I had never

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:84%
been allowed to ask
root cause solutions

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and root cause causes that
are driving this cancer

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:84%
epidemic that my generation of
physicians got to be witness to.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And so for that, I
started to reach outside

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.810 align:middle line:84%
of the pharmaceutical model
and then spent about 10 years

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:84%
running an integrative
clinic and ended up

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
finding myself in
the same place that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
in both the allopathic
western medicine

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.336 align:middle line:84%
model and the alternative health
functional medicine thing.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
In both cases, we were
training our patients

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
to look outside of
themselves for health.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And in that journey,
started to discover

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.718 align:middle line:84%
within my own spiritual
development and everything else

00:02:17.718 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:84%
that there is
absolutely nothing that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:84%
can come from outside of
ourselves to complete ourselves,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it be the completion
of our spiritual identity,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:84%
our physical
identity, our health.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And so realized in
that journey that we

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
had to bring that full circle
and stop looking outside

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
of the body for the solutions
and realize that health was

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:90%
going to emerge from within.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And so now I'm closing
my clinic and moving

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
into this space of the
journey of intrinsic health.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
How do we discover
health within the body,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and how do we create a safe
environment where the individual

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:90%
can start to explore that?

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And even though it
sounds esoteric on one hand,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:90%
it's not.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:90%
It's about light.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
When it comes down to
it, it's about light,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
the capacity to carry
light from the soul

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:84%
into the physical
cells of the body.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And when that light
diminishes too much,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:84%
we see what we're
seeing right now.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to be too negative,
but I spend a lot of time

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
traveling as you do in
airports and everything.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
almost as though you're

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:90%
living in a zombie population.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
People just have this
pallor about them

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:90%
and staring at their phones.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel the life
and color and liveliness.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.112 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel the light.

00:03:28.112 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Yeah, the life
force is certainly

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:84%
diminishing on the
planet, and humans

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:90%
are caught up in that decline.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And you see nature solving
for that all the time.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Nature is an
adaptive machine that

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:84%
really has designed a system
in which adaptation is always

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.550 align:middle line:84%
the driver, and that adaptation
is driving for diversity,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and that diversity is leading
to beauty, intelligence,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately an ascendant
path towards more light.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a couple of
different forms of energy

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:90%
that you're touching on there.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:84%
One would be what
might be called

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:84%
the soul, which is
an energy field that

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:90%
pre-exists the first cell.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got
an energy field

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.200 align:middle line:84%
that is present at the
moment that a cell decides

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:90%
it's going to procreate.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got
sperm and an egg.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
massive flash of energy

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
that happens called
the zinc flash there

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of conception.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And that massive
lightning bolt moment,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
you have an alignment with
biological system, which

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
is one that is creating light
in the three dimensional reality

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
template that had been there

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:90%
just a moment ago.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And the template is
in the physics plane.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a quantum
field or biophysics interaction

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
happening where the quantum
field template by which you're

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
going to self-organize
a human body

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:84%
is being now joined
by the biology, which

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to be expressed in
the third dimension here.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
The light that you were
saying and the soul holds

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:84%
is actually the
potential of light

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:90%
or the potential of particle.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's a waveform, and it
has complex geometry to it.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And each soul,
each identity seems

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
to have a different geometry
in that quantum field.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:90%
So that's the original template.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And then manifesting within that
template is what I would say

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
is more of our collective
experience of light.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's no longer
waveform, but it's actually

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
light in the visible
spectrum perhaps

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.340 align:middle line:90%
or in the ultraviolet spectrum.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And in these spectrums
of light generation,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:90%
particle can be created.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how a
cell becomes something--

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
is the transmission of light
from wave into particle.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
The particles coalesce into
several different identities

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
of molecular structure,
and then they

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
form to this invisible template
that's in that soul structure.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And so when we start talking
about cancer and the light

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:84%
within the human, we're talking
actually about sunlight.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:90%
And so that's not the soul.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:84%
That's like expressing
itself necessarily

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:84%
in each cell to create
enzymatic function and DNA

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:90%
synthesis and all that.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:90%
That's solar light.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In the mitochondria.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.985 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And it's released
by the mitochondria,

00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately, it's
coming in from sunshine.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the chlorophyll
within the plant

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:84%
grabs that sunshine, stores
it between two CO2 molecules.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So carbon dioxide is
the code for life.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Without CO2 on this planet,
we would have no life.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the tiny bit of CO2 that
we have in this atmosphere is--

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:90%
0.04% of the atmosphere is CO2.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this
tiny amount of CO2

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
that is necessary for
sunlight to be stored.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's this interface
between CO2 and the atmosphere

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.958 align:middle line:84%
and this miracle of the
chlorophyll within plants

00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:84%
that allowed the
potential for light energy

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
then to eventually get
into a single cell,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
would be a bacteria
or multicellular

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
cooperation of the fungi
or multicellular organisms

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:84%
like an earthworm or
ultimately a human.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
This was a generative process of
getting more and more sunlight

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:90%
to be held within a single cell.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And so right now, we represent
in this kind of biology

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:90%
of macro flora and fauna.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:84%
The plants and animals
that are here currently

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:84%
are the brightest things
that have happened.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And it is very bright.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And so there's so much sun
being released in every cell

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:84%
of your body, 70 trillion
cells cranking sunlight,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that every cubic centimeter
of the mitochondria that are

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:84%
filling each of your cells is
generating about 10,000 times

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
more sunlight than the surface
of the sun per cubic centimeter.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the difference
between physics and life

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:90%
is a concentration of light.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Mind blowing to
think about conceptually.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And so at the same
time, when you

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.920 align:middle line:84%
measure light in living light,
in mitochondria, in human cells,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, you're
finding that the light

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that we're emitting is actually
going down in concentrations.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, we're
indoors all the time,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and we're not even
exposed to sunlight.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are no longer
exposed to sunlight at all.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So before we go into the
other agricultural issue,

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about sunlight.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about CO2 because
that's a naughty word

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:90%
in some political movements.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Yeah, it's
interesting how

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:84%
we have demonized biology, and
in this case, chemistry as well.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we've demonized CO2 as
the cause of climate change.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Again, we have
tiny amount of CO2.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
We have 20% of our atmosphere
in oxygen, some 70% nitrogen,

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:90%
and 0.4%--

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
way, way, way down there
in the CO2 concentration.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's necessary for life.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
reverse that narrative.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:84%
It was a convenient
marker for human behavior

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:84%
because many of our
industrial forces

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.797 align:middle line:84%
produce CO2, driving a
car, creating concrete.

00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it was worth
talking about that had to be

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.930 align:middle line:90%
talked about.

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Yeah, I think
where it is helpful

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is it starts us to understand
that there is actually

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.480 align:middle line:90%
a cycle of life.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
If anything that
is energy, which

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:84%
is money, fuel in
your gas tank, love,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:90%
these are all forms of energy.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
And nature knows no waste.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Humans have created waste
streams because we believed

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:90%
in these scarcity models.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And when we see scarcity, we
think that's how nature works.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we believe
we're functioning

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:90%
in a scarce universe as humans.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we
create a waste streams.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:84%
What the CO2 story could
have done instead of saying,

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.762 align:middle line:84%
here's the horrifying reality
of global warming and everything

00:09:12.762 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
else, it could have showed
us that the Earth is

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:90%
in a respiratory cycle.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you kill the
lungs of the planet,

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:90%
she can't take her next breath.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:90%
And we have done that.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Those are our logging
practices globally.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Or soil practices,
even deeper than the--

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And soil--

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
right there in just a sec.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So this whole notion that
we are killing our planet

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:84%
through our practices
lays a great amount

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:84%
of guilt and urgency and
shame on a lot of people.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.120 align:middle line:84%
How would you actually
frame that so those

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.790 align:middle line:84%
aren't the response, but
something more proactive

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:90%
is a response?

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.088 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Well, the exciting
thing about any form of stress

00:09:51.088 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:84%
is it's the only thing
that creates change.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that nature
seems to love to do is change.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at the
4-billion-year history of this

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.850 align:middle line:84%
planet, there has never been
a recreation of the past.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Nature's always striving
for the next expression.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And so this adaptation drive
that lies within nature

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:84%
is manifest in the beauty
that we see around the planet.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And the more severe
stress you put on biology,

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.440 align:middle line:84%
the more vigorous it imagines
the near future and far future.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And it does that
through the virome.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:90%
And so we've demonized CO2.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:90%
We've demonized viruses.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, CO2 is actually
the storage for energy

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:90%
that allows biology to happen.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.200 align:middle line:84%
It is the
concentration of energy

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:84%
that allows for us to move
from physics to biology.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And then biology adapts
through constant changes

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.520 align:middle line:90%
of the genetic code.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:90%
And it does that now by viruses.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And so viruses are a description
of genes that can travel.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:90%
And they are not alive.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
They're not like bacteria
and fungi and yeast.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.620 align:middle line:90%
These are genetic envelopes.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
These are, basically,
messages of the future.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And so a virus is nothing more
than the potential of life

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.100 align:middle line:90%
on Earth in a few years.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when you
put things under stress

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:84%
is they accelerate the rate at
which they're producing viruses.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So if I go through
a stressful day,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:84%
had a stressful
Monday, that day, I

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:84%
started producing genetic
variants of myself

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and then secreting
those through my breath,

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:84%
through how of my secretions,
my urine, my sweat, everything

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:84%
suddenly generating
new information that

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.513 align:middle line:90%
will end up in nature.

00:11:28.513 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it'll end up
in the water system.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:90%
It'll end up in the air.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm generating a
new potential for life

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of my stressful day.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Viral, would you say?

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: I go viral.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, you go
viral, a good way to put it.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:90%
We can all understand that.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back
to the Earth itself

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
because again everything you
do, everything that you work in

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.300 align:middle line:84%
is steeped in
finding our way back

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.710 align:middle line:90%
toward a more healthy template.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:84%
We can never go back
to where we were.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we know that.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But what we did also
learn during COVID,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.190 align:middle line:84%
which was so amazing, is if
you just stop kicking Earth,

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:90%
she's fine.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:84%
She'll regenerate
almost overnight.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So we know the Earth has
this incredible regenerative

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:84%
capacity, and I
assume we do, too.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: We are nature.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We are nature.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: It's really
hard to remember that.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.735 align:middle line:90%
We've so lost it.

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:84%
English is such an
interesting language

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:84%
in that it thrives on the
differentiation between things.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:84%
If you go to any of our
Indigenous languages that--

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:90%
I have a Celtic lineage.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And so if you go back to my
Celtic lineage, the language

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.840 align:middle line:84%
itself only understood itself
within the context of nature.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
differentiation.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.045 align:middle line:84%
There was no word for nature
because it was everything.

00:12:39.045 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everything
was nature.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Yes.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying there's
this other thing.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And so our fascination
in the English language

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:84%
of differentiating or separating
everything into their categories

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
became a very powerful
tool for science,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
but that then created
a scientific belief

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
that we were
separate from nature.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.643 align:middle line:84%
And you can go look at the
Oxford English Dictionary

00:12:58.643 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and find out that
we define nature

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
as everything in the firmament
of the Earth, minerals, plants,

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:90%
animals, except--

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.730 align:middle line:90%
no, it doesn't say except.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.522 align:middle line:84%
It says as opposed to humans or
anything humans have created.

00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we've put ourselves
not just outside of nature

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.910 align:middle line:90%
but in opposition to nature.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.243 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Opposition to nature.

00:13:14.243 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And I bring that up because you
talk about in some of your talks

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:84%
that this Earth was covered
in grassy lands, grasslands,

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and there were weeds,
what we call weeds now.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:84%
There were grasses and
weeds and everywhere.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And it kept the soil
at a certain condition

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and temperature and the air as
well, the ambient air around us.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So unless we're gone,
it's unlikely to go back

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:90%
to looking exactly like that.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But those principles
still apply.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Earth will still generate
these things if we allow it.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about what happened

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:84%
because this is a big part
of the story when glyphosates

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.270 align:middle line:90%
were introduced.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Yeah, so
glyphosate is a name

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:84%
of a chemical that's
become the most

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.440 align:middle line:90%
ubiquitous toxin on the planet.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
We spray about 4 billion
pounds of this single chemical

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:84%
into our soil and water
systems globally each year.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it really, by
volume and by mass,

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
just dwarfs anything
else that we're

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:84%
putting in from a small
molecule chemical standpoint.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And these small
molecule chemicals

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:84%
are in a family called
organophosphates.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And the first really famous
one that we developed in the US

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:84%
under a small company
called Monsanto at the time

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.630 align:middle line:90%
was for chemical warfare.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that chemical
was called Agent Orange,

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
but it was an organophosphate,
same family of molecules.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And we used it to
devastate anything

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that was green in
Cambodia and Vietnam,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:90%
to make bare that entire zone.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.198 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we devastated
the peoples there.

00:14:34.198 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I actually grew up with
them interestingly.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Right here in Boulder,
where we're filming,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in low-income housing
here with the Hmong people

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that had been
displaced from Cambodia

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.352 align:middle line:90%
because of Agent Orange.

00:14:43.352 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And little did I
know my career was

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.335 align:middle line:84%
going to take me to be one
of the scientific groups that

00:14:47.335 --> 00:14:49.710 align:middle line:84%
would study that family of
molecules more than any other.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So it was an interesting
foreshadowing of my future

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I think growing up here
with the Hmong people.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And my earliest memories of
living there was walking across

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
the little plank out to
the community garden that

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:84%
was adjacent to the government
housing, and each of these Hmong

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.650 align:middle line:84%
women were kneeling
in the garden

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and would kneel there and
tell a story all day long.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
So they were in their
traditional gowns

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
telling their
traditional stories.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And here they are displaced
12,000 miles from home.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.460 align:middle line:90%
And they had joy.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:90%
And they had a sense of home.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
They had a sense of
belonging because they had

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:90%
the Earth beneath their feet.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And they had the self-expression
of creativity and story.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:90%
And so that stuck with me.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And we started
Farmer's Footprint

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:84%
as this awareness campaign of we
can actually become what we eat,

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:90%
which is good news.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
We can actually begin
to eat Earth again.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.160 align:middle line:84%
We can begin to
eat nature again.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And as we let go our convenience
lifestyle of processed

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.700 align:middle line:84%
everything and to really
start to understand

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.530 align:middle line:84%
what nature intended for,
which is really light--

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:84%
it's the passage of
light through food.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start
to see food as light

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and you start to understand
its relationship to sun

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.885 align:middle line:84%
and you understand its
relationship to the soil,

00:16:01.885 --> 00:16:04.010 align:middle line:84%
you simply tell a different
story to your children.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And you develop
a different home.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
You develop different offices
because now every step,

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
it starts to be,
where is my soil?

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Where is my sun?

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Where is my soil?

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Where is my sun?

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And for the human, that
soil is within the gut,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and we spring out of
this an incredible life

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
force out of the organic
garden that is a human being.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But most of the Earth
isn't an organic garden anymore.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Most of the Earth of
the, quote, "productive,"

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84%
industrialized agriculture
anyway, is the other.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:84%
It's been exposed to the
organophosphates to--

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.176 align:middle line:84%
I mean, RoundUp as one
of the labels for it.

00:16:37.176 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:10%
So you look at this, and you
say, OK, let's look at what

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:10%
the repercussions.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:10%
The reason we're talking about
is it has huge repercussions.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go into huge
extension of this, which

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the development
of future generations

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:90%
and the impact on our hormones.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:90%
This is huge.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we'll
do the timeline quickly,

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:90%
debut 1976 of glyphosate.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Obesity starts in the '80s.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Early '90s, crops were widely
sprayed by the early '90s.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: '91, we started not
just using them as weedkiller.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:84%
We started treating the
crops directly with RoundUp

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
right before harvest
as a desiccant.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So it started with
wheat and quickly moved

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.187 align:middle line:84%
to the legumes, your lentils,
your soybean, all of this.

00:17:20.187 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And so especially
in northern climates

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.660 align:middle line:84%
where you have a
short growing season,

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:84%
if your crop is
threatened, you can

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
spray RoundUp across the entire
crop and kill it in a few days

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:84%
so that you can harvest
it early because you

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:84%
need a dry crop to harvest
those following crops.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So 1991 is really started to
shift towards crop treatment

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:90%
rather than a weed killer.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're
35 years into that.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Yeah.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And then by 1996, we have
squash, corn, soybeans,

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
all genetically modified so
that we could spray RoundUp

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
even before it was
supposed to be dead.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So it was really this
progression of use outside.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It used to be a weed killer, and
then it became a crop treatment

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:90%
mechanism.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that was over
the course of the 1990s.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when
we see that light

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.640 align:middle line:90%
diminished within the biology.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So you describe glyphosate
coming into the thing.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
It functions as an antibiotic,
so it kills bacteria and fungi

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.713 align:middle line:84%
in the soil, kills bacteria
and fungi in your gut.

00:18:10.713 --> 00:18:11.797 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You need those.

00:18:11.797 --> 00:18:12.720 align:middle line:90%
They're full of light.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: That's where
that carbon is coming in.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So your long carbon
chain that is

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.120 align:middle line:84%
waiting to get to
your mitochondria

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:90%
is glucose or fatty acids.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So sugars and fats are
long carbon chains of CO2

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that were put together
to store sunlight.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So sugar and fat is coming
through the microbiome

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.430 align:middle line:84%
It's metabolizing it
down, breaking it down

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:84%
to bioavailable
resources for the body.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And then that travels in.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
that glyphosate

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:84%
is a water-soluble
molecule that's

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:84%
now traveling with
your food and water

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.270 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
the terminal cell.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So now every one of
your 70 trillion cells

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:90%
is taking up the nutrients.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.053 align:middle line:84%
It's taking up glyphosate,
which is an antibiotic.

00:18:49.053 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, those
little mitochondria

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.670 align:middle line:84%
are little tiny bacteria
that live inside of you,

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and they die very quickly
under that chemical threat.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we can't have
that because that's our transfer

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.257 align:middle line:90%
That's our life force.

00:18:58.257 --> 00:19:00.257 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: So you can no
longer liberate life force

00:19:00.257 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:90%
from glucose and fatty acids.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the body circulates
it back to the liver.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.407 align:middle line:84%
And now the liver
starts storing fat.

00:19:05.407 --> 00:19:06.490 align:middle line:90%
That's called fatty liver.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And so by the late '80s, we have
the type 2 diabetes epidemic

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:84%
beginning because we could
no longer get the light out

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:90%
of the food.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
storing food as fat.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And now, as you
just said it a minute ago,

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:90%
it is an epidemic.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Diabetes is an epidemic.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: All of the chronic
diseases began going epidemic,

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.600 align:middle line:84%
meaning that it reached every
nook and cranny of the planet

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:90%
over the last 30, 40 years.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
makes it epidemic

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:84%
is that it's traceable to
an environmental factor.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not just
a human condition

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:84%
because you can track
the environmental causes

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:90%
of the human experience.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's what
really makes something

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:90%
an epidemic.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:84%
If disease was simply
being expressed within us,

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
then we'd have to look
within for the problem.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But disease is trackable
by these outside influences

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that are shifting our
internal resources.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now not only
is diabetes an epidemic,

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:84%
now we're having wheat
sensitivity and celiac all from

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:90%
these pesticides.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Yeah, so
the phenomenon there

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.127 align:middle line:84%
was this high concentration of
the glyphosate chemicals being

00:20:10.127 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:84%
used towards the end
of the crop production.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So we end up with higher
residues in our finished food

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:90%
products.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.513 align:middle line:84%
And for that, my
laboratory has been

00:20:17.513 --> 00:20:18.930 align:middle line:84%
studying the effects
of glyphosate

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:90%
directly on human cells.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to demonstrate,
almost 10 years ago now,

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that when you add glyphosate
to the gut membrane,

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:84%
you break the tight
junctions that

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%
create a healthy barrier
between the outside world

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:90%
and your immune system.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And when that breaks,
it's been popularized

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:90%
with the term leaky gut.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening
is your immune system

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
is now having to see
everything in your environment.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.495 align:middle line:84%
And so it began with gluten
sensitivity is famous,

00:20:42.495 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:84%
but it's really food
sensitivities in general

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:90%
became normal.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:84%
So you got one in four
kids that now that

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.970 align:middle line:84%
has a food sensitivity to
avocados or nuts or seeds

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:50.770 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.812 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got this
vast amount of dysfunction

00:20:52.812 --> 00:20:55.458 align:middle line:84%
because the food is no longer
being processed before being

00:20:55.458 --> 00:20:56.625 align:middle line:90%
shown to your immune system.

00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It's leaking through
your guts literally,

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.900 align:middle line:84%
through the membrane
into the system.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So then, of course, we
have a rise in cancer

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:90%
that's following this that--

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.630 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows about-- I mean,
you can go into stats, autism.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Everything starts
rising at this time.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can't really
deny something happened.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Yeah, it was the late
1990s is when everything kinda

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:90%
hokey sticked up.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So we had obesity starting
to mount and then 1990s hit

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly autoimmune and
immune dysfunction, allergies,

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
food sensitivities, but then
direct organ system dysfunction.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
By 2002, we had like one
in four girls in the United

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:84%
States at age 12 were found to
have antibodies to their thyroid

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And so this autoimmunity
to our own glands,

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:84%
to our own system
of communication,

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:90%
which is the hormone system.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we were
seeing this breakdown

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:84%
of relationship,
which is actually

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:90%
what the immune system is.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not a battleground to
make a sterile body, which

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:90%
is still what's being taught.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But the body is not
a sterile system.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a relationship
of a complex ecosystem

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that expresses itself
in a human body.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And the immune
system's job is to keep

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:90%
all the relationships balanced.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to break that
relationship between the gut

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
microbiome and the soils
within us to that gut membrane,

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
to the immune system behind it,
you overwhelm the immune system,

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.172 align:middle line:84%
and you get chronic
inflammation.

00:22:17.172 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And chronic
inflammation then leads

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
to all of the diseases we
know today in our children,

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.670 align:middle line:84%
attention deficit,
autism mentioned.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
In our mid-single
digits, you're starting

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
to see precocious puberty
and pubertal dysfunction.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And then as you start to
go into 12 to 15-year-olds,

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.905 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing a
depolarization of gender.

00:22:35.905 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're going to
get into that whole subject

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and the extension of what that's
going to mean for society.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Just to wrap this part up, so
we see what has happened here.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.910 align:middle line:90%
So people watching this--

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.702 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of our
viewers, most of them,

00:22:46.702 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
probably say, yeah, well, that
doesn't matter so much for me

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:90%
because I eat organically.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And we've gone out of our
way for 30-plus years to eat

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:90%
organically.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Yeah.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.097 align:middle line:84%
And the organic
movement, I think,

00:22:59.097 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
started in a very exciting place
where there was a recognition

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s that we got to
not do this chemical thing.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:84%
We need to start,
again, having systems

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.120 align:middle line:84%
that are growing real food
within the United States

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.570 align:middle line:90%
where that movement began.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
already a recognition.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you look back, you can
go all the way back to Steiner

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.902 align:middle line:84%
and Rodale and all these guys
back in the '50s and '60s that

00:23:18.902 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:90%
were already saying it.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.860 align:middle line:84%
They're like, this is
going to destroy humanity.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:90%
They predicted the whole thing.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And so by the '70s, we
were starting to think, OK,

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.470 align:middle line:84%
we got to have some way of
telling the consumer that

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.090 align:middle line:84%
there's food that's been grown
through chemical agriculture

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and there's food that's grown in
some connected state to nature

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:90%
still.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we created
the organic movement.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, what we
find is that "what you resist

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.280 align:middle line:84%
persists" is one of those
great phrases out there.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:90%
And when you just say anti--

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.080 align:middle line:84%
so organic became
an anti campaign.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It's antiherbicides,
antipesticides.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But it never mentions in
the entire organic registry

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
of things check
boxes the quality

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.130 align:middle line:84%
of your soil, the nutrient
density of your soil,

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.020 align:middle line:84%
the nutrient density of
the finished product,

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So we said, don't
do a bunch of stuff.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But when your
identity is don't do,

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.788 align:middle line:90%
you don't become something new.

00:24:07.788 --> 00:24:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's start
talking about what you do do.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.142 align:middle line:84%
How you do find
with all of this--

00:24:12.142 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of all,
you're saying, oh my god,

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:84%
can I hook up to something and
have it all chelated out of me?

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So in lieu of that, what
can we as individuals

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:84%
start doing to make
sure we're eating

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
from very wholesome, full
earth-connected sources of food?

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And are they exempt from that?

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Yeah, I think that step
one is if you can get organic

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:84%
food, which is actually
relatively unusual

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.568 align:middle line:90%
in the world--

00:24:38.568 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
but if you can find it, that's
a step in the right direction.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.200 align:middle line:84%
You're sending an
economic signal back

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:84%
to the system that you're
trying to get away from,

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:90%
a codependence with chemicals.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.840 align:middle line:84%
As you move into,
what can you do,

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:84%
you start finding yourselves
in the space of permaculture,

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:90%
biodynamic farming, new--

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:84%
farming techniques, all kinds
of different specialties

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
that have developed within the
soil and crop management systems

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.860 align:middle line:90%
over the last 50 to 80 years.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these have been
proven at scale, millions

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:08.360 align:middle line:90%
of acres under management.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:10%
And so this isn't some
theoretical backyard garden

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:10%
solution.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:10%
This can happen and feed people.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:10%
And so this movement
has been long afoot.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's been now captured
in a bucket called

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:90%
regenerative agriculture.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the regenerative
agriculture is really

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:84%
a reimagination of
the organic movement

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.330 align:middle line:84%
where it starts to say,
well, what do we do

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:90%
rather than what we don't do?

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.773 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's beautiful.

00:25:30.773 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Biointensive and biodynamic
gardening is beautiful.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's even high yield
with beautiful flavors

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.880 align:middle line:90%
to the vegetables and fruits.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is
no downside to it.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: There is no
downside, and there's only

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.578 align:middle line:84%
an alignment with nature
that's actually happening.

00:25:44.578 --> 00:25:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
align with nature,

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:84%
you move from a scarcity
mentality and reality

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.733 align:middle line:90%
into one of abundance.

00:25:50.733 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And so we're really
talking about moving

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:84%
into an abundance state
with our food systems.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:84%
That's never happened in recent
recorded history of the last

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:90%
5,000 years.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:84%
We've been enslaving people
through war to grow food

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:90%
since the Egyptians.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's like every
empire is actually

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:84%
creating, more recently, through
economic manipulation, slave

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.980 align:middle line:84%
labor somewhere in the
world to produce cheap food.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And so that's been 5,000
years of that behavior.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So we've been stuck in
that scarcity mentality.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And we have steadily been
engineering ourselves out

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.047 align:middle line:84%
of sovereignty at
the food level.

00:26:23.047 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have food security.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.713 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The most basic level.

00:26:25.713 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to
make it-- or we have

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.340 align:middle line:84%
to have our own due diligence
to find these sources of food.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to have
people say, yeah, but I mean,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:90%
I have four kids.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:90%
We're on limited income.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I can't afford organic.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:84%
So then how-- and I want to
ask you too about when you go

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:41.970 align:middle line:90%
to farmer--

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I live in an area that's
abundant with soil and actually,

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.607 align:middle line:84%
biodynamically
grown food and such.

00:26:47.607 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But then there are a lot of
people at the farmers market

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.780 align:middle line:90%
that say "unsprayed."

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.390 align:middle line:84%
They say we can't really
afford that certification.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So just briefly, how do
we connect in that way?

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:90%
And what else do we do?

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.060 align:middle line:90%
What else can we do--

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, supplements
or meditation or whatever--

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.165 align:middle line:90%
to start changing this?

00:27:04.165 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Ultimately,
we don't need

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:84%
to change our
behavior towards soil.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:84%
We need to change the
behavior of the human.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.408 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to realize
that we are of nature.

00:27:12.408 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Nature is speaking through
us, acting through us,

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and creating through us.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And if we can come
back into that reality

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.540 align:middle line:84%
where we no longer have
the abstract belief that we

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.510 align:middle line:84%
are separate from nature and
we start to really reconnect

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.030 align:middle line:84%
to our natural systems,
reconnecting to ultimately one

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
another in new relationship,
we will create a different food

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.795 align:middle line:84%
But I believe we have to
recreate that human culture that

00:27:31.795 --> 00:27:33.703 align:middle line:84%
will then express
that new reality.

00:27:33.703 --> 00:27:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, that
makes perfect sense.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit
of a long haul thing,

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:84%
but now we know what
we're up against.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And now let's look at
some of the effects that

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.402 align:middle line:84%
have taken place, you've
already gone into.

00:27:42.402 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:84%
The hormonal profile of each
generation, since all of this

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:84%
became ubiquitous,
has started changing.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what you're seeing.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.250 align:middle line:84%
You talked a little bit about
young girls and thyroid,

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.640 align:middle line:90%
but let's go beyond that.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Yeah, so you start
to get into very quickly

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:84%
the hormones that start to
dictate the gender polarization

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:90%
that happens in utero.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So while we're
developing mother's womb,

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:84%
we are differentiating,
from our genetics templates,

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.340 align:middle line:84%
the energetic
expression of gender,

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and that relies on
testosterone and estrogen

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.310 align:middle line:90%
as two examples within it.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually 4,000
hormones that have been

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.270 align:middle line:84%
recognized within
the human body.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:90%
We've only named 40 of them.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.397 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
all these hormones

00:28:24.397 --> 00:28:26.480 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even name
and are very much involved

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.280 align:middle line:90%
in this process.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But to dumb it down to two,
it's testosterone and estrogen.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And the differentiation
of those actually

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:84%
creates changes in our
neurologic development.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And so these deep
nuclei within the brain

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:84%
are changing size based on their
testosterone-estrogen ratios

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:90%
in the womb.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And so as you start to
create hormonal disruption

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.995 align:middle line:84%
through the chemical
environment, and the chemicals

00:28:48.995 --> 00:28:50.870 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
that are diminishing

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.750 align:middle line:84%
light energy by killing the
mitochondria within the womb,

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that intense reality
of diminishing light

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.680 align:middle line:84%
within a manifesting
human being,

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.140 align:middle line:84%
you're challenging its
ability to create life.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And in that stress,
interestingly, testosterone

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and estrogen start to
equate instead of polarize.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And so when a male embryo or a
male adult goes under stress,

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:84%
the testosterone will start
to convert to estrogen. When

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:23.780 align:middle line:84%
the female child, infant,
all the way to the adult

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:84%
starts to go into
stress, the estrogen

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.900 align:middle line:90%
is converted to testosterone.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And so under stress, we
go into a unisex nation.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
unisex reality that's

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:84%
emerging because of
the simple phenomenon

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.422 align:middle line:84%
of the way in the endocrine
system adapts to stress.

00:29:39.422 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I'm going to get
a little esoteric here then.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at a time
ahead where people fall into,

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:49.650 align:middle line:84%
on one hand, a more cohesive,
collaborative, peaceful way

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:90%
of being.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get religious
about it or whatnot,

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.400 align:middle line:84%
we talk about patriarchy
ruling for many years.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of separation
wars and a lot of testosterone.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:84%
The human male is loaded
with testosterone.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And females, we know the
nurturing and so forth.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'm asking two questions--
two forks here at one time.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:84%
If we're trying to learn to
become collaborative as peoples,

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.070 align:middle line:84%
is there something
that's almost driving

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:22.990 align:middle line:84%
this neutrality in gender
identification in utero?

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Is there maturity, I should say?

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
on a larger scale

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that's driving that to create a
less polarized environment we're

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.870 align:middle line:90%
living in?

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, physically, we
eliminate the polarization.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.520 align:middle line:90%
We eliminate the people.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.128 align:middle line:84%
We go away because there's
not the same amount of sex.

00:30:42.128 --> 00:30:44.170 align:middle line:84%
There's not procreation
going on in the same way.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you could talk
about both streams of it.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Well, it's
interesting when

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.813 align:middle line:84%
you start to hang out with
Indigenous wisdom keepers

00:30:50.813 --> 00:30:51.730 align:middle line:90%
from around the world.

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:52.702 align:middle line:90%
This was predicted.

00:30:52.702 --> 00:30:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It was predicted
that we would have

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.290 align:middle line:84%
this disillusion
of the masculine,

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.870 align:middle line:84%
feminine in its old
expressions and all that,

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:90%
and something new would emerge.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
opportunity to recognize

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.460 align:middle line:84%
that stress or
pathology on biology

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.790 align:middle line:90%
is not seen as an endpoint.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not seen as actually
disease by nature.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:90%
It's seen as a new opportunity.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And so nature's always looking
for the next opportunity.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that creates
that is always stress.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.227 align:middle line:84%
And so 55 million
years ago, it was

00:31:18.227 --> 00:31:19.810 align:middle line:84%
an asteroid that hit
the planet killed

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.350 align:middle line:90%
all the topsoil worldwide.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Now it's glyphosate.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.565 align:middle line:84%
And we're spraying 4 billion
pounds of it globally.

00:31:24.565 --> 00:31:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we're killing
the topsoil and creating

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.850 align:middle line:84%
that existential stress
on the environment.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And nature says, fantastic,
here's my next opportunity.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we can perhaps
look at each other in grace

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:39.820 align:middle line:84%
right now and have complete
nonjudgment on the situation

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.350 align:middle line:90%
of, how did we get here?

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:84%
It's important to understand how
we got here or else we're not

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:44.830 align:middle line:84%
going to have the opportunity
to become the new thing.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We got
to find a way out.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And so understanding
the march of glyphosate

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.230 align:middle line:84%
isn't here to judge a
company or products.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:52.432 align:middle line:90%
We created these companies.

00:31:52.432 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that's something
we forget a lot.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.682 align:middle line:84%
We created these
companies because we

00:31:55.682 --> 00:31:56.920 align:middle line:90%
stopped growing our own food.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.350 align:middle line:84%
1945, this country was growing
40% of its food in the backyard

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:01.150 align:middle line:90%
gardens.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, 0.01% of our food is being
grown in backyard gardens.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So we created
chemical agriculture

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:84%
so that farmers with no
labor-- because the kids

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.420 align:middle line:84%
didn't come back to the
farm after World War II.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And so with no
labor, the farmers

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.840 align:middle line:84%
were being demanded to grow
more because nobody wanted

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:84%
to bother with the-- so we
created the chemical food

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.030 align:middle line:84%
industry, high fructose
corn syrup and TV dinners.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And the 1950s was this explosion
of nonnatural food systems,

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Wonder Bread, Twinkies.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.110 align:middle line:90%
So it was fake--

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Swanson's TV dinners.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Now it's fossil
fuel being repackaged

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.150 align:middle line:84%
as new chemicals, things like
saturated, unsaturated fats

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:37.993 align:middle line:90%
and all this stuff.

00:32:37.993 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So we were creating all
of these new chemicals

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:41.542 align:middle line:90%
that we were calling food.

00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that we
are having a pushback on that.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.410 align:middle line:84%
You see Twinkies
going out of business.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Wonder Bread's gone.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And so there is this
starting to return

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.910 align:middle line:84%
as a species to understanding
that nature actually tastes

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:84%
better and actually creates
more generative energy

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.010 align:middle line:90%
for our bodies.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we're just
naturally moving back

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:84%
towards selection for real
food, which is encouraging

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:00.620 align:middle line:90%
that we're capable.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't understand
how we went on that arc,

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.670 align:middle line:90%
we won't do it quick enough.

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens when
you have a species that

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.810 align:middle line:84%
is adapting due to
stress for the women

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:84%
to become more
masculinized and the men

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.420 align:middle line:90%
to become more feminized?

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.973 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we are going into--

00:33:15.973 --> 00:33:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking at all
the reason-- everybody has,

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.270 align:middle line:90%
if you've watched anything.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Looking at all the recent
charts of population collapse,

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:24.760 align:middle line:90%
we're not in growth.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.500 align:middle line:90%
We're in population collapse.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Certain countries are just--

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.860 align:middle line:90%
it's almost sad.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:84%
On one level, it's time
for radical change.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So these infrastructures
need to reform, transform,

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:39.140 align:middle line:90%
be birthed again.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.010 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:44.110 align:middle line:84%
But when people in
a political way say

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:84%
we have to support this
or that or the other thing

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.150 align:middle line:84%
because we have too many
people on this planet,

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and they're rejoicing the fact
that the decline in population

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:84%
is happening without thinking
of the extension of that.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.420 align:middle line:90%
The extensions are huge.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Yeah.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And you've got governments
really paying attention.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.690 align:middle line:84%
China is in a very
awake state right now

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:84%
as a government of realizing
the negative population

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.460 align:middle line:84%
spiral that they're in is
going to destroy their country.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.543 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:34:10.543 --> 00:34:13.449 align:middle line:90%
There's no infrastructure left.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:14.810 align:middle line:90%
There's no Social Security.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:15.679 align:middle line:90%
There's no Medicare.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.380 align:middle line:84%
All that stuff goes
when you don't have

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.920 align:middle line:90%
replacement population anymore.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: That's right.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So then now you
have a whole vulnerable older

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.082 align:middle line:90%
population.

00:34:22.082 --> 00:34:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Their kids better be
ready to take care of them

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:84%
because the state's
not going to do it.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.507 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Yeah, we have, I think,
what's called the sandwich

00:34:28.507 --> 00:34:31.239 align:middle line:84%
generation right now where we
have 30-year-olds that are still

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:32.960 align:middle line:84%
holding on to the
last of health.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.315 align:middle line:84%
They were the last generation
to have that polarity of gender

00:34:36.315 --> 00:34:38.210 align:middle line:90%
and all of this going on.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And those 30 to 40-year-olds are
now supporting their elders that

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.270 align:middle line:90%
got sick faster than expected.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to take early
retirement because mom's got

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:90%
Dad's got Parkinson's.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.719 align:middle line:84%
And then their kids are getting
sicker faster than they ever

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:51.519 align:middle line:90%
have before.

00:34:51.519 --> 00:34:54.333 align:middle line:84%
And so the sandwich generation
is this demonstration of we

00:34:54.333 --> 00:34:56.250 align:middle line:84%
have the last productive
generation right now.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A lot of stress.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And a lot of
stress on both sides.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:84%
The children coming
up, the elders there.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we're putting
the whole society

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:04.680 align:middle line:90%
under a productivity collapse.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's not surprising that we
have this new explosion of AI

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and computerized systems
and robotics coming on.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're going to
come in and fill the gap.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.688 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: To come fill the gap.

00:35:12.688 --> 00:35:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And so if we say, oh, good,
fortunately, those came along,

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.780 align:middle line:90%
then we will go extinct.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, we're
on the wrong path then.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: But there's
this opportunity

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.850 align:middle line:84%
to wake up right now and move
into this realization of we are

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.740 align:middle line:84%
biologic beings
that move in light,

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and our light relies
on the amount of CO2

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:90%
this Earth can breathe.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that
breathes is the soil.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Trees move water.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.900 align:middle line:90%
They can bring energy down.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But they're only a very small
part of the respiratory cycle.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.910 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly grasslands
and savannas that

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.660 align:middle line:90%
are that lung of the planet.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And we wiped those out in
the name of agriculture.

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And now we need to
reverse that pattern,

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and we need to redream what
grasslands look like as grazing

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:84%
of normal herd intensity
that used to graze and move

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:90%
long distances.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.472 align:middle line:84%
We fenced the world in the
name of property ownership,

00:35:56.472 --> 00:35:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and none of the animals
can move anymore.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we've lost the
motion of life on the planet

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.070 align:middle line:90%
through fencing.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And even in conservation, they
did this giant national parks

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:08.500 align:middle line:84%
fenced in Africa and everything
else and save this animal.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So we'll fence this off
and push people off.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So we've fenced this world into
this place of no relationship.

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we have to go
back to that relationship,

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.830 align:middle line:84%
but we have to also deal with
the reality that a generation,

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.950 align:middle line:84%
two, three generations of people
have this changed hormonal

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.770 align:middle line:84%
profile, which brings up
a metaphysical opportunity

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:26.830 align:middle line:90%
for friendship.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the really
younger generations,

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.140 align:middle line:84%
when you see in terms of
social media or entertainment,

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.480 align:middle line:84%
has seem to have more
of a friendship bond

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.790 align:middle line:90%
than Romeo and Juliet bond.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.610 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, you just
fall in love, and that's that.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:45.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of polarity, a lot of
sex, a lot of falling in love.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Now it seems to be
tempered with what

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.630 align:middle line:84%
we talked about earlier
with this lack of polarity

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.690 align:middle line:84%
or lessened polarity
into more of a friendship

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.960 align:middle line:90%
zone on relationships.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
hidden opportunity in that

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:84%
while we can still get
enough polarity back

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.142 align:middle line:84%
that we still have people
to populate the planet.

00:37:05.142 --> 00:37:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: That would be
the lovely outcome.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think we can wake
up quick enough for that.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that healing
happens logarithmically faster

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.360 align:middle line:90%
than disease.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned this in the
laboratory over 30 years.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I've learned it in my
clinic over the years.

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.940 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen it in myself.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.450 align:middle line:84%
It can take decades to do
the destruction that would

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.080 align:middle line:90%
cause a cancer cell to occur.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And it takes seconds for that
to remit if it's reconnected

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.640 align:middle line:90%
to the original design.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And so as we release
the stress factors that

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.840 align:middle line:84%
are pushing on us and the
chemical reality that we live in

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.870 align:middle line:84%
is part of that, but the
emotional, spiritual stress

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.580 align:middle line:84%
that we're under equates
to that in my mind.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I think they're just yin-yang
of the same side of the coin.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:46.560 align:middle line:10%
And so as we start to lose
the fear, guilt, shame

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.720 align:middle line:10%
paradigm of being
human, and we start

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:10%
to realize we are
nature imagining itself,

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.870 align:middle line:10%
and we are the imagination
of nature past,

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:58.120 align:middle line:10%
and we are now cocreating
with nature the life to come,

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:10%
and as we move into that
cocreative relationship

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:10%
to nature, we're going to
really have a fundamental shift

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.990 align:middle line:10%
in relationship to that planet.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And we can become part of
the solution very quickly.

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what do you see
relationships of the future

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.140 align:middle line:90%
looking like?

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you and
I-- we talked off camera.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.890 align:middle line:84%
We're both really
just loving the notion

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:20.610 align:middle line:84%
of letting friendship come
first, even in male, female,

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.100 align:middle line:84%
masculine, feminine, regardless
of what body you're in,

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.730 align:middle line:84%
relationships, having
friendship rise up

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.280 align:middle line:84%
as this little sprout at
the core of this attraction.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.227 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Yeah, it is
an exciting paradigm,

00:38:32.227 --> 00:38:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's such a relief that
we have the solution sitting

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.435 align:middle line:90%
right in front of us.

00:38:35.435 --> 00:38:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Because as we look out at
the bigger effort to partner,

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.490 align:middle line:84%
we see a lot of stress
in that environment.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.020 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority of
marriages are failing.

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.890 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority of kids
coming into the world

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:48.990 align:middle line:90%
are not of a marriage anyways.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:51.188 align:middle line:84%
Especially in urban
environments and all of this,

00:38:51.188 --> 00:38:52.980 align:middle line:84%
you've got the vast
majority of pregnancies

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.605 align:middle line:84%
happening outside of marriage,
and there's no marriage to come.

00:38:55.605 --> 00:38:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And so already there's a
dissolution of that structure.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But then once made, that
marriage is more than 50%

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.200 align:middle line:90%
likely to dissolve.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And we saw an acceleration of
that during these recent years.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we're seeing
stress around that.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And the society is
trying to express

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.540 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of new options.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.998 align:middle line:84%
And so it's desperately looking
for those new opportunities

00:39:12.998 --> 00:39:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and expressing
itself in all kinds

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:16.210 align:middle line:90%
of definitions of relationship.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.118 align:middle line:84%
But what I see is
that it's like me

00:39:18.118 --> 00:39:20.410 align:middle line:84%
moving from allopathic medicine
to functional medicine.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:22.050 align:middle line:84%
When you kick the
doctor off the stool

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, this is
the new toolbox that's

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.840 align:middle line:84%
going to work for you, but
it's outside of the body still,

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.990 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to solve it.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:30.948 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we've
done with relationships,

00:39:30.948 --> 00:39:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe, is we have
replaced one codependent model

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:34.920 align:middle line:90%
with another codependent model.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is described really
well in the course of miracles

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:39.780 align:middle line:90%
almost 50 years ago now.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It said that humans only
do special relationship.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Special relationship
is a situation

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.750 align:middle line:84%
in which you look
at another person,

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and you see in them
a trait that you

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.020 align:middle line:84%
don't think you can
get from source,

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and you go and
bond to that trait

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.860 align:middle line:84%
until you've drained it
out of them, and it's gone,

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:90%
and then you leave.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that's not good.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.862 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: So this is how we
are treating our Earth.

00:39:58.862 --> 00:40:00.340 align:middle line:84%
We see something
that we think she

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.340 align:middle line:84%
has that we can't get from
source, energy, whatever it is,

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and we take from
it until it's gone,

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and then we move
further abroad to find

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.350 align:middle line:84%
more supply chain for our
food and everything else.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.687 align:middle line:84%
And we are doing this to
one another in relationship.

00:40:11.687 --> 00:40:12.770 align:middle line:90%
And how is that happening?

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Why are we draining
each other of life?

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.883 align:middle line:84%
I started a nonprofit
a couple of years

00:40:16.883 --> 00:40:18.550 align:middle line:84%
ago called the Institute
of Natural Law,

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and we're understanding
the systems of natural law

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:23.650 align:middle line:84%
as a foundation for
our new society.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
new historically.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just new to an abstract
reality of our modern societies.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But natural law was the system
that almost every Indigenous

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.570 align:middle line:84%
peoples on the Earth
were practicing

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.030 align:middle line:84%
as individuals, as
households, as communities,

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.480 align:middle line:90%
and as nation-states.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And we saw empire
come and replace that.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And so empire became a more
lucrative and more powerful

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:84%
way of concentrating
energy in small spaces

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.120 align:middle line:84%
under fewer hands than
natural law had allowed.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:90%
So it became a potent tool.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.270 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of factors that
dictate the laws of nature,

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.190 align:middle line:84%
but I can tell you
that the result is

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.900 align:middle line:90%
adaptation and biodiversity.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
interesting that we then

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.280 align:middle line:84%
have come along in our
empire model of scarcity.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.460 align:middle line:84%
We need to own
everything we can.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.090 align:middle line:90%
We did that to relationship.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.635 align:middle line:84%
And so we developed an
ownership model of one another.

00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's true.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.885 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And in
that ownership, we

00:41:12.885 --> 00:41:15.610 align:middle line:84%
start to suck life
out of one another.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And that happens
emotionally, spiritually.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.690 align:middle line:84%
But one of the really
startling things

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that we found in our clinic is
that we were using these energy

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.720 align:middle line:84%
field cameras, looking at that
energy production from the body.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And what we found is
that the reflexology map

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.680 align:middle line:84%
on the fingertips can show
you the energetic pattern

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.430 align:middle line:90%
within deep organ systems.

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out the ring
finger on your left hand

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:41.800 align:middle line:84%
is the female endocrine
system within every one of us.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you slip a
ring on that finger,

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.998 align:middle line:84%
you disrupt the
meridian system of that.

00:41:45.998 --> 00:41:46.956 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:46.956 --> 00:41:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And so spiritually,
emotionally, I say,

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.770 align:middle line:90%
here's your engagement ring.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:52.240 align:middle line:90%
And now I own you.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:90%
As a male, I own you.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't put the ring on.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:55.723 align:middle line:90%
I put a ring on you.

00:41:55.723 --> 00:41:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, so we switched
another finger or ditch it

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.700 align:middle line:84%
or wear it like we did when we
went steady around our necks?

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.867 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: This sounds right
to me, put it on a pendant

00:42:02.867 --> 00:42:03.890 align:middle line:90%
and wear it there.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as you
put it on any finger,

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.303 align:middle line:84%
you're going to disrupt
the meridian system.

00:42:07.303 --> 00:42:09.752 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know
if it was an accident.

00:42:09.752 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, this is the
one closest to the heart.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, you do it.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason it's
closest to the heart

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.398 align:middle line:84%
is because that's the
meridian system that runs

00:42:16.398 --> 00:42:18.130 align:middle line:90%
your entire endocrine system.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And so pulling that ring off
will accelerate metabolism,

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.917 align:middle line:84%
help you lose weight, turn
your sex drive back on.

00:42:24.917 --> 00:42:26.500 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
things that can happen

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.672 align:middle line:84%
when you get that endocrine
finger working again.

00:42:29.672 --> 00:42:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know if
it was a mistake or not,

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:35.020 align:middle line:84%
but it seems curious that we
created a contract for males

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to pass wealth down,
and we slipped that ring

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:39.400 align:middle line:90%
on the finger of the woman.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And for a male to slip
it on that finger,

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I haven't suppressed
my testosterone axis

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.390 align:middle line:84%
because my right
side is my masculine.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:48.317 align:middle line:84%
So I'm diminishing a
bit of my feminine.

00:42:48.317 --> 00:42:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I start putting wedding
rings on males a long time ago.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And what's going
to happen is you're

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.350 align:middle line:84%
going to have an imbalance
and overexpression

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.930 align:middle line:84%
of the masculine traits and
underexpression within the male.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, we have that.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:57.690 align:middle line:90%
You can see it on the Earth.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And so there
might be questions...

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.607 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's fascinating.

00:43:00.607 --> 00:43:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But we packed a lot
into 45 minutes.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.050 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to get a bit
of the metaphysical glimpse

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:09.147 align:middle line:84%
over some of the more dire
consequences of agriculture,

00:43:09.147 --> 00:43:11.480 align:middle line:84%
for example, and the decisions
we've made on the ground.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And I love what you had to
say just a few moments ago.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:18.310 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that healing
happens way faster

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:20.680 align:middle line:90%
than the process of disease.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to
embrace it right now,

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.220 align:middle line:84%
anyone listening
to this and says,

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.850 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I'm going to
find a biodynamic, for lack

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:30.438 align:middle line:84%
of a better description,
a source of food now,

00:43:30.438 --> 00:43:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to look
my partner in the eye

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and think of what I can
witness and accept and give

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:38.020 align:middle line:84%
to that person instead of what
I can steal from them, what

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.527 align:middle line:90%
would happen to this planet?

00:43:39.527 --> 00:43:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: We can't
imagine how beautiful

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:42.850 align:middle line:84%
it gets because the
dinosaurs could not

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:45.778 align:middle line:90%
imagine birds, mammals, humans.

00:43:45.778 --> 00:43:48.070 align:middle line:84%
That's what happened when
they went under enough stress

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.032 align:middle line:90%
to disappear.

00:43:49.032 --> 00:43:50.740 align:middle line:84%
We're now putting
extinction-level stress

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.130 align:middle line:84%
on a planet, and whatever exists
here is already genetically

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:56.870 align:middle line:84%
imagining a world
we cannot imagine.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:58.210 align:middle line:90%
There was no wildflowers.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.830 align:middle line:90%
There were no deciduous trees.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:03.170 align:middle line:84%
There was no fall colors
before the last extinction.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.028 align:middle line:84%
And so the planet
went into rainbows

00:44:06.028 --> 00:44:07.070 align:middle line:90%
with the last extinction.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's beautiful.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.223 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And so what
went from dinosaur

00:44:09.223 --> 00:44:12.650 align:middle line:84%
to human because of a stress
event is about to happen again.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.160 align:middle line:10%
And so we cannot imagine what
kind of glory comes on this

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.310 align:middle line:10%
planet next.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:18.610 align:middle line:10%
But I think we can
participate in state of play

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:10%
if we quickly align ourselves
with nature, which is to say,

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.740 align:middle line:10%
every relationship, to
your soil, to your food,

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.360 align:middle line:10%
to your partner,
to whatever it is,

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.933 align:middle line:10%
has to focus on the question
of, how do we create adaptation

00:44:27.933 --> 00:44:29.350 align:middle line:10%
for the greatest
amount of change,

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.300 align:middle line:10%
for the most rapid growth
of the individuals?

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we're going to
create a different society.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've got
chills all over.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Zach, thank you so much.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
what you had to say.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I feel like this is a
super important story.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.968 align:middle line:84%
People need to understand
what's going on

00:44:44.968 --> 00:44:47.130 align:middle line:84%
at the larger scale and
the beautiful potential

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.040 align:middle line:90%
at the end of it.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Glad to be with you.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I hope you enjoyed
this conversation as such a huge

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:84%
percentage of humanity is
struggling with both health

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and relationships at
this time in history,

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.680 align:middle line:84%
