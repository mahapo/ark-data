00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:18.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Some of you have

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.180 align:middle line:10%
heard the statistics regarding
the numbers of patients that

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:10%
die as a direct result
of patient care.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.740 align:middle line:10%
You may have also read
of the repeated efforts

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:10%
by lobbyists to restrict or
access to natural supplements.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.530 align:middle line:10%
Investigative journalist
John Rappaport

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:10%
has spent decades keeping us
informed as to the threats

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:10%
to our health freedom.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:90%
He joins me today.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And some of this conversation
may be challenging.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
The images are
certainly irreverant,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.367 align:middle line:84%
but our hope is that the
information will stick.

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you so
much for joining on this one,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
because there is
so much confusion

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
around so many issues
regarding our health.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And we see legislators standing
up in front of Congress

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:84%
telling why we have to have FDA
approval over our supplements,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
when in reality it's the
stuff that has already passed

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:84%
their approval that is
killing so many people.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:90%
And I want to launch right in.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the scope of the
problem-- statistics, numbers.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN RAPPAPORT: OK.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:90%
The year is 2000, July 26.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.430 align:middle line:10%
In the "Journal of the American
Medical Association," which

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:10%
is one the most prestigious
medical journals in the world,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:10%
an insider named Dr.
Barbara Starfield

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.450 align:middle line:10%
who is working at
the Johns Hopkins

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:10%
School of Public Health,
another "we salute

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.197 align:middle line:10%
thee" from the insiders of
the-- everybody's credentials

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:10%
are impeccable, all the
way up and down the line--

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:10%
the journal, the
school, the doctor.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And she publishes a
review on July 26, 2000

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:84%
called "Is US Health Really
the Best in the World?"

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And in this paper,
this revered--

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:84%
not just respected, but
revered-- public health expert

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Barbara Starfield says that
every year in the United States

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
the medical system is
killing 225,000 people.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.980 align:middle line:84%
If you take that out
to a decade, that's

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:84%
2.25 million people a decade,
which some people will try

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:84%
to gloss over, but if they
really stop and think about it,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:84%
the very profession
dedicated, we

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
say, to saving lives is
suddenly the third leading

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:84%
cause of death in
the United States

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
behind heart disease and cancer,
killing 225,000 people a year

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and 2.25 million
people per decade.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:84%
This is what Starfield says in
her peer-reviewed expert review

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.706 align:middle line:84%
study in the "Journal of the
American Medical Association".

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could we guess
that that might even

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:90%
be a conservative number?

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: She has admitted
it's conservative to me,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.970 align:middle line:90%
because I interviewed her.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
does it look like?

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: She
said, look, there

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:84%
are later estimates that
were higher than mine.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I asked her,
I said, has anybody

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:90%
challenged your findings?

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:84%
She said, there
was one challenged

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:84%
by one person who obviously
had a conflict of interest.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But she said, if you read the
literature and the journals

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and so on, there's been
no attack on my findings.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, other people
have come along

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and found larger numbers
of death figures.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
You can go as high
700,000 a year

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
if you want to take
outsiders' studies,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
outside the
mainstream, of deaths

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:90%
caused by the medical system.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
But you see, the
reason is, I wanted

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
to stick with the
people that are

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.314 align:middle line:90%
respected within the mainstream.

00:03:47.314 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.335 align:middle line:84%
Well, it makes sense
journalistically

00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:50.126 align:middle line:90%
to do that anyways.

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:51.707 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Just
to show, OK, now,

00:03:51.707 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:84%
if you were going to pay
any attention to anybody,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:90%
who would it be?

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.041 align:middle line:84%
One of your own, published
in one of your own journals.

00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the most
prestigious of your journals,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:84%
working for the School
of Public Health

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that is revered as
high as any other.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:90%
And here are the facts.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know some of this
is procedural, but a lot of it

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.127 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the drugs
that are prescribed.

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: I'll break it down.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
106,000 a year caused by
FDA-approved pharmaceutical

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:90%
drugs.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:84%
That's more than
a million people

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
a decade killed by
drugs that the FDA has

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:90%
approved as safe and effective.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, people have to realize--
they may think they realize it,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
but I'll just kind of drill
it in a little tighter

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:90%
into their heads.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't get a
drug, a medical drug

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
on the market in the
United States in any way,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:84%
shape, or form unless
the FDA has approved

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:90%
it as both safe and effective.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.020 align:middle line:90%
They are the gatekeeper.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
They are the court of first,
and last, and middle resort.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
They're the agency
tasked with this.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So if we are
talking about, let's

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
say, as Starfield
indicated, 106,000 deaths

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
a year caused every
year like clockwork

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.890 align:middle line:84%
by FDA-approved drugs--
that's over a million people

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle line:84%
a decade-- then what
is going on at the FDA?

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good question.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.291 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Right?

00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:90%
What is going on at the FDA?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And why isn't any other branch
of government interceding?

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll tell you a
secret, which I recently

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:90%
discovered through a tip.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:84%
The FDA is well aware
of these numbers.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.420 align:middle line:84%
People have said to
me, well, you see,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
you're digging up things
out of medical journals,

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:90%
and how could they know?

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And the most absurd kind of
apologetics for these people.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you're
trying to tell me

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that the FDA doesn't know that
the drugs that they approve

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:84%
as safe are killing people
at the rate of 100,000

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.585 align:middle line:90%
a year in the United States?

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Is this what you believe?

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we believe it.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we have a web page
on the FDA's own site, which

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:84%
you can get to by
googling "FDA why

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
learn about adverse
reactions to drugs?"

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And people have taken
screenshots of it

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
in case the FDA decides
to take it down.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And on that page, they readily
admit, with references,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:84%
100,000 people a year die from
reactions to medical drugs.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
But in this incredible
display of what can only

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:84%
be called schizophrenia,
real schizophrenia,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
the FDA takes no
responsibility for that figure.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they consider
people just collateral damage?

00:06:39.375 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.290 align:middle line:84%
When they're faced
with that, when they're

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:84%
confronted with it,
what do they say?

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.395 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: They will
not reply when confronted.

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'll modify
that a little bit.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, well, you
know, it's basically

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.490 align:middle line:84%
the patient is trying
to medicalize himself.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:84%
The patient is doing
things with the drugs

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:90%
that were not meant to be done.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:90%
So blame the patient.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:90%
That's one of their strategies.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll say the doctor
was miscombining drugs

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
in his prescriptions,
but of course, we

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
couldn't have predicted
that at the FDA.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:90%
This is all nonsense.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
The studies that
have been done were

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:84%
talking about
correctly prescribed.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And correctly used.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.769 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yeah, as
far as anybody can tell.

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They may have
forgotten a pill at noon,

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.046 align:middle line:90%
but basically, yeah.

00:07:32.046 --> 00:07:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: We're talking
about crazy people who decide,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:90%
let me take half the bottle.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.026 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, see
if I can get a buzz.

00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: This
is legit stuff here.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
verified by other groups.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Starfield's study
is not the only one,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
but it broke the egg in half.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
From then on, things
were different

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.140 align:middle line:84%
even though nobody
wanted to admit it.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.570 align:middle line:84%
The press covered
it for a short time.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look at this.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:90%
Strange, unbelievable.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.197 align:middle line:84%
Three days, four days, a
week, a month-- it's all gone.

00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, of course
this is going to happen,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:84%
because we have an extremely
flawed approval process.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yes, the FDA,
when they approve drugs,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:90%
the process is flawed.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:84%
We know that
doctors, for example,

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
who sit on FDA panels who
approve or deny approval

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:84%
to the drugs, they have
conflicts of interest

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.070 align:middle line:84%
with the very drug companies
that are making the drugs.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.325 align:middle line:84%
And they're receiving
money as honoraria.

00:08:30.325 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:84%
There are junkets and
all sorts of things.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.870 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:84%
But you see, this problem
goes deeper because--

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is where people,
they like to check out.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.191 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
hear about this.

00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have to repeat,
they know at the FDA

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.350 align:middle line:90%
that this is what's happening.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Every year, they know.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:84%
They know that 100,000 at least
are getting killed by the drugs

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:90%
that they're approving.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're not doing
anything about it.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I asked Barbara
Starfied, has the FDA

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:84%
ever talked to you about
corrective measures

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:84%
since your study was
published in the year 2000?

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:84%
This interview
was done by email.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:84%
She wrote, in
capital letters, no.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, to your knowledge,
has any government agency

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
tried to correct the situation,
taken remedial action,

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:84%
as 225,000 people a year
die from the effects

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:84%
of the medical
system, as 106,000

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%
are killed by
FDA-approved medications?

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Has any government agency tried
to do any remedial action?

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.859 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking now
about an ongoing crime.

00:09:39.859 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:90%
This is an ongoing crime.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.247 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With no oversight.

00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: No oversight.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And you have to say to
yourself, if you had a job

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and you knew that
what you were doing

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
was causing 100,000 people to
die every year-- every year,

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:84%
not just one year
but every year--

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and you could somehow
keep yourself together

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to even function or stay alive
in the face of what you knew,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.570 align:middle line:84%
would you try to do anything to
change it, or fix it, or help

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:90%
it, or not?

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
You see, we have to reduce
it down to these terms.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, everybody's
living in La La land.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.665 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, this
is a big agency.

00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:23.922 align:middle line:90%
It's a gigantic government.

00:10:23.922 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows the other
thing, what's happening,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:90%
who's doing what to who.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.074 align:middle line:84%
All of that is just
complete baloney.

00:10:30.074 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
bottom line is there

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.176 align:middle line:84%
are billions of dollars at stake
on the patents for these drugs.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yes, And
there are people dying.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And the FDA understands this.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:90%
They know what's going on.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:90%
They absolutely know.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:84%
They also know-- and
this is no small point--

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that if 100,000 people are dying
every year at least as a result

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
of drugs that they have approved
as safe in the United States,

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
then what about all
the published studies

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:90%
in the medical journals?

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean just a few.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean thousands of studies
that have been published

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.897 align:middle line:84%
in medical journals that
said, this drug is safe,

00:11:04.897 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
that drug is safe, this drug
is safe, that drug is safe,

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.089 align:middle line:90%
this drug is safe-- thousands.

00:11:11.089 --> 00:11:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And now we're talking
about once occurring.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
ongoing, again, crime.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.880 align:middle line:84%
All of those studies
are fraudulent.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:90%
They're all fraudulent.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've talked to many doctors
as a reporter who have told me,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:84%
the rock of our profession
is the published studies,

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:90%
the clinical trials of drugs.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:84%
This is what separates us
from alternative medicine.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is what keeps
us, as a science,

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:84%
from going back
into the Stone Age.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:90%
They're serious.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:84%
They really believe
this, you see.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And then when I run this down to
them, as we've just done here,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:84%
they not only don't
want to hear it,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
they don't believe
they've heard what I said.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
It's as if you're sitting there
and I'm saying to you, ABC,

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:90%
and you're hearing FGH.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:84%
They literally don't put
together what I'm saying

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:90%
because they can't.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if they did,
they would be admitting

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.210 align:middle line:84%
that the rock upon which
they rely, and saying this

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.580 align:middle line:84%
is our science, this
is what keeps us sane,

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:84%
is completely and
utterly a fraud.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Completely fraud.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.262 align:middle line:90%
And I have statements.

00:12:22.262 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and there have been

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.635 align:middle line:84%
plenty of, in recent
times, clinical trials

00:12:26.635 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:84%
that have been
falsified that have come

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:84%
to light that the
public knows about.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet they'll continue
on and maybe repurpose

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.770 align:middle line:90%
that drug for another use.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Sure.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll say, well,
we caught this one.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Didn't we do a great job?

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:90%
No, we're talking, as I said--

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.876 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Someone sued them.

00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: --thousands of
ongoing fraudulent trials.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I have statements
published on my site.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.557 align:middle line:84%
Marcia Angell, for
example, who was for years

00:12:55.557 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
the editor of the
"New England Journal

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:84%
of Medicine," the most
prestigious journal

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:90%
in the world, 20 years.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And she says, reluctantly I have
come to the conclusion that I

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:11.210 align:middle line:84%
cannot trust published
clinical evidence.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was brave of her.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Well,
yeah, it may be brave,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.569 align:middle line:90%
but it's also stunning--

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Shocking.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: --to realize this.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:90%
This is a published statement.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is any
of it founded on, then,

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.650 align:middle line:84%
if not science, i.e.
these clinical trials?

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: It's
founded on the principle

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:90%
of what can we get away with?

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:90%
We're in the jungle.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:90%
What can we get away with?

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And isn't
there another loop

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
hole or overlay in
that these drugs

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:90%
are patented technologies?

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And patents have
certain protections

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:84%
in and of themselves,
where they do not

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
have to be subjected to
public trials and scrutiny

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
for any long period
of time even.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, certainly like GMOs.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.222 align:middle line:84%
That would fall
under that, right?

00:13:58.222 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yes.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Once they're approved,
there is such a thing

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:84%
as post-marketing
surveillance, as they call it.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
But this is really
easy to get around.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very difficult
to do, first of all.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.616 align:middle line:84%
And they're not really
trying that hard to do it.

00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You really have
to make an effort

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
to see what is
happening with people

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:90%
who are taking this drug?

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.486 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to light,
it's because it's unavoidable.

00:14:29.486 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Because people are having
heart attacks and strokes

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and dying all over the
place, like with Vioxx.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:90%
OK, we can't any longer deny it.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But under the table, this
is going on all the time,

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's just not being recorded
or reported or whatever.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:90%
The patent basically--

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
approval and the patent,

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:84%
because once the drug
is approved-- let's

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:84%
say it's your
drug, your company.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:90%
You have the patent.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can't interfere with
my company and your patent

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:84%
for seven or eight
or maybe 12 years,

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.310 align:middle line:84%
depending upon the
length of the patent.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't compete with you.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:90%
That's what the patent means.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:84%
But what you've got that's more
important than the patent is

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:84%
you've got the
approval of the FDA,

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
because you can now
go around and say,

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.216 align:middle line:84%
well, you claim my
drug is killing people.

00:15:19.216 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.700 align:middle line:84%
All I know is the government
has said that my drug is safe,

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.536 align:middle line:90%
and that's all I had to prove.

00:15:27.536 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, at
the same time, you've

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.910 align:middle line:84%
got these companies
that say, well,

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
the reason these drugs
are so expensive,

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
the name-brand
drugs, is because we

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:84%
had to put hundreds of
millions into R and D on it.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.522 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's that-- I
don't quite understand.

00:15:44.522 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And then to come through
the other end with something

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:84%
that can be dangerous
to one's health.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.650 align:middle line:90%
What is that money going into?

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
What's really going
on when they say

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:84%
they're putting hundreds
of millions into R and D?

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: They're
doing maybe 20 studies,

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
25 controlled studies, which
can be fairly expensive to do.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying this
is the whole price

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:90%
of what they're talking about.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
they're doing so many studies

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.460 align:middle line:84%
is because they
know that they're

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.604 align:middle line:84%
going to bury the studies that
are uncomplimentary to the drug

00:16:18.604 --> 00:16:21.145 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to feature
the ones that are complimentary.

00:16:21.145 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is common.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yeah.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's do a bunch
of these studies

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:84%
because we're going
to pick and choose.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And time and time again,
companies get caught.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.495 align:middle line:90%
And they say--

00:16:33.495 --> 00:16:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't that happen
with Vioxx and a few others?

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: --we'll
never do this again.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:90%
We'll pay the fine.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.552 align:middle line:84%
And in one case
recently, GlaxoSmithKline

00:16:44.552 --> 00:16:47.300 align:middle line:84%
was fined $3 billion--
three billion,

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
largest judgment in
history-- over finagling

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with
several of their drugs

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.100 align:middle line:90%
during a certain time period.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, you add up the
profits of those three drugs

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.430 align:middle line:84%
from that time period that we're
talking about, $27 billion,

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're paying
a $3 billion fine.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And people are saying this
is magnificent achievement

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:84%
for the law
enforcement community

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:90%
to be able to win this case.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:90%
Nobody gets prosecuted at GSK.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:90%
Nobody goes to jail.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.952 align:middle line:84%
They pay $3 billion
out of a pot of 27.

00:17:21.952 --> 00:17:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cost of
doing business, really.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Cost
of doing business.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And they factor it in and
they put the money away.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
so unconscionable.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a kind of
detached, almost sociopathic

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
structure underneath that
could allow for people

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:84%
to just turn the other
cheek to the fact

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.270 align:middle line:84%
that 100,000 people
plus, conservatively,

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:84%
are being killed
by these things,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
to even have the temerity
to falsify the studies,

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
to toss out the ones that
say, hey, this stuff's bad.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:90%
This is criminal.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.110 align:middle line:90%
You just said it a moment ago.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:90%
It's criminal.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yeah, it's murder.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
people have to face.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this
conversation has a challenging

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:12.700 align:middle line:84%
turn in it, because
we live in a society

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:84%
where, at least at
a certain level,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle line:90%
everybody wants to be nice.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And part of being
nice, nicey nice,

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:84%
is to make excuses
for other people.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:28.330 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
ingrained cultural attitude.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to
forgive, and we learn.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And let's not be too hasty to
make judgments here or speak

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:90%
ill of so and so.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
We have to have hands off,
and we have to be neutral.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And this also feeds into a
whole kind of fake spirituality,

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:84%
actually, if we
want to expand on it

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:84%
into universal tolerance
for anything happening

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:90%
from any quarter of human life.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But basically, when
you judge this crime

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about,
you say, well, maybe it's

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:90%
negligent homicide.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.350 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.800 align:middle line:84%
That means that they neglected
to notice what was happening.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, they know
what's happening.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.070 align:middle line:90%
How did they neglect it?

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, manslaughter.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:18.650 align:middle line:84%
No, that carries an idea of
accidental death or passion

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.506 align:middle line:90%
of the moment.

00:19:20.506 --> 00:19:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
temporary insanity.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Temporary insanity.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking about
surgical sociopathy, right?

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's out.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.080 align:middle line:90%
OK, so where does that leave us?

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, does it leave momentary
murder, second degree?

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
This is premeditated, because
it happens year to year.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is murder
homicide, murder one.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So in a sane society,
what would happen

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:84%
is officials from the
Department of Justice

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
would drive to the headquarters
of these pharmaceutical

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.220 align:middle line:84%
companies or fly, serve
warrants, and arrest

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:84%
the people, put them
in chains-- the CEOs,

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
other executives,

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and the lead researchers--
on a charge of murder.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.420 align:middle line:90%
That would be sane.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
go to the FDA, which

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:84%
is really right down the
street, Justice Department.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And they would begin arresting
those people for murder,

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:90%
not negligent homicide.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Because the FDA knows that every
year this is going to happen.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Last night we were
talking off the record,

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.161 align:middle line:84%
and I gave you the
image of the gatekeeper.

00:20:24.161 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:90%
You're a gatekeeper.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.899 align:middle line:84%
And you live in this new
dimension where there's a field

00:20:28.899 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:90%
and there's a gate.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And you know that on January 1,
you open the gate every year,

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
and people pass through.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know that every
year 100,000 will die,

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:84%
because you open the gate
to this particular field.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
You know there are other
gates to other fields,

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:50.670 align:middle line:84%
but you choose to open
this gate every January 1.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.673 align:middle line:84%
And every year you do
it, and every year you

00:20:52.673 --> 00:20:55.450 align:middle line:90%
know at least 100,000 will die.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.615 align:middle line:90%
What does that make you?

00:20:57.615 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Is there any
argument about that?

00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we have to come
to grips with this situation.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the same time,
using the same argument,

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:90%
you have tainted asparagus.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Oh boy, that's all
over the headlines.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:90%
The farmers are ruined.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything's recalled.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:90%
People are suspicious.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't even buy the
good asparagus, not even

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.860 align:middle line:90%
the organic asparagus.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Really because maybe
one person died,

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:84%
or maybe one person became
ill enough to be hospitalized.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And that gets us even into
the area of supplements.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I get really upset when I see
every year an effort is trotted

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.280 align:middle line:84%
out to ban supplements, or to at
least make them more difficult

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.570 align:middle line:84%
and put them under FDA
approval before anyone

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.606 align:middle line:84%
can take a natural supplement
to augment their own health.

00:21:44.606 --> 00:21:46.355 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: So the
record is, virtually--

00:21:46.355 --> 00:21:47.521 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's the record?

00:21:47.521 --> 00:21:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: The
record is no deaths

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:84%
from nutritional supplements,
none recorded by the US Poison

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Control Center.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.522 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet this comes up
before Congress most years.

00:21:57.522 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yeah,
but the thing is

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:84%
it comes up in perverted
form, obviously.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm giving you
is the distillation of 30

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.130 align:middle line:84%
years of tracking down
these monsters as a reporter

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and saying, OK,
let's have my kind

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:90%
of hearing before Congress.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, boys, move back.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.697 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be
my kind of hearing.

00:22:18.697 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to bring
up this one witness,

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
say, now, you're

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.981 align:middle line:84%
for the Poison Control Center,
isn't that correct, sir?

00:22:23.981 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, you know what a
nutritional supplement is?

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed I do.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:90%
So give us a list of some.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Vitamin A, D, all these.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, we want your statistics
for the last five years.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:39.450 align:middle line:84%
How many deaths were
caused by the full range?

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And please speak
clearly and loudly.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, does that mean zero?

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Zero.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you very much.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Dismissed.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Now let's bring up the
person from the FDA.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:57.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, you see this web
page on your own site here?

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It says that every year 100,000
people die of adverse reactions

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:90%
to drugs, to medical drugs.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, true or false--
these would be drugs

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
that your agency has certified
as safe and effective?

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.743 align:middle line:84%
Well, you mean there's
another way for these drugs

00:23:13.743 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:84%
to reach the public,
besides certification?

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, of course.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:90%
We're the agency.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So these drugs are killing
100,000 people a year.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And you've been aware
of this for how long?

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, 10, 15 years.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I see. so that's
a million people.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, let me see if
I have this straight.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You really
can see the absurdity.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.693 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: You've
allowed a million people

00:23:39.693 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
to die without making any
changes in the drug approval

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:84%
process, but over
here, you're trying

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.800 align:middle line:84%
to prosecute nutritional
supplements that kill nobody.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
A million people
a decade, nobody.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.970 align:middle line:84%
A million people
a decade, nobody.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.650 align:middle line:90%
That's the end of the hearing.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And now, we put this up
on the news, nightly news.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.972 align:middle line:84%
In a sane world, the networks
would pound on this for months.

00:24:07.972 --> 00:24:09.680 align:middle line:84%
They would say, guess
what we discovered?

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Brian Williams would lose
all of his hair overnight.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:16.000 align:middle line:84%
He'd say, I actually have
a story, a real story.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:84%
The FDA has been prosecuting
supplements that kill nobody,

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and the drugs that they approve
kill a million people a decade.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.180 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
let go of this story.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to hear
about it for three months,

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and people are going
to be up in arms.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
This changes the
perception of reality.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.450 align:middle line:84%
This is what
journalism is supposed

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
to really do is change
perception of reality,

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.450 align:middle line:84%
not just, oh, look at that
story, and this story.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
whole point of this,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.750 align:middle line:84%
that this could change
perception of reality

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:84%
in the country if the media
outlets pounded on it day

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:54.462 align:middle line:90%
in and day out.

00:24:54.462 --> 00:24:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
they're not going to,

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
because look at who the sponsors
are of the various news shows.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:84%
It is shocking the
percentage of drug companies

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.670 align:middle line:90%
that now sponsor the news.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's a
very direct link to that.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And we can move beyond drugs
and look at other substances,

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:84%
One of them that has gotten
a lot of attention and is,

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.494 align:middle line:84%
again, it should've been
pulled off the market.

00:25:15.494 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It should have never
gone on the market.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.410 align:middle line:90%
But Donald Rumsfeld.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk aspartame.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:90%
He was in a powerful position.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: He said I'm going
to get this approved no matter

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.940 align:middle line:84%
what I have to do,
basically, for Searle.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.420 align:middle line:90%
He got it approved.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:84%
He pulled whatever
springs he had to pull.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So studies have shown-- you
can interview any number

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
of researchers who will tell
you that aspartame is indicted

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:51.981 align:middle line:84%
in neurological storms,
so to speak, brain--

00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Obesity.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.086 align:middle line:90%
It's at the base of so many.

00:25:54.086 --> 00:25:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: --malfunction.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And it is a
ubiquitous supplement,

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.162 align:middle line:84%
we could call it, a food
supplement, you see,

00:26:01.162 --> 00:26:02.620 align:middle line:84%
but not the kind
of food supplement

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about over here.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:84%
This is drug supplement
by drug company.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.620 align:middle line:84%
This is artificial sweetener
under a variety of names.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.860 align:middle line:90%
This can be approved.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.340 align:middle line:84%
This can be pushed
through because

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.577 align:middle line:90%
of political clout, period.

00:26:14.577 --> 00:26:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the variety

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.170 align:middle line:84%
of names, because I
think a lot of people

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:84%
don't exactly know
where aspartame still

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:90%
resides in the food chain.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yes.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't give you all of them.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I remember the prime
one was NutraSweet

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.330 align:middle line:84%
that everybody knew
about, but there

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.044 align:middle line:90%
have to be six, seven, eight.

00:26:31.044 --> 00:26:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think there are.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And I forget, too, because
I don't use the stuff.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then I write
it down, and then I forget.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.119 align:middle line:84%
But I think all anyone needs
to do is start looking into it.

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:84%
You can Google it and
find out all the names

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.370 align:middle line:90%
that NutraSweet goes by.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's causing just a plethora
of chronic health issues

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.956 align:middle line:84%
among the citizens, not the
least of which is obesity.

00:26:48.956 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Look what's happened to
the levels of obesity

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
in the population switching
over from sugared sodas

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.380 align:middle line:90%
to diet sodas.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Then again, this variable
is hidden from the people.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking
at-- I don't know.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
aspartame-related illnesses

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.489 align:middle line:84%
there are each year, but we
know that it's significant.

00:27:08.489 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: But they
would diagnosed, of course,

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.717 align:middle line:84%
as other things and then
treated with toxic drugs.

00:27:12.717 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
talk more about toxic drugs

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.716 align:middle line:84%
when we come back
from our little break,

00:27:16.716 --> 00:27:18.490 align:middle line:90%
in the form of vaccines.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:20.860 align:middle line:84%
This is a very scary
subject for a lot of people.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be back
in just a moment.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:30.890 align:middle line:90%


00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.904 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the next evolution
of Conscious Media Network.

00:27:33.904 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have been with
us throughout our journey

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and now, as a result of our
partnership with GaiamTV.com,

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.990 align:middle line:84%
we're able to reach
more independent,

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:90%
progressive thinkers like you.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:10%
In addition to the hundreds
of interviews for CMN,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm now able to do twice as
many interviews each month

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.650 align:middle line:10%
with the leading visionaries
and authors of our time.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:10%
This is possible because of
Gaiam TV's genuine commitment

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.694 align:middle line:10%
to preserve and expand this kind
of groundbreaking information.

00:27:59.694 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:10%
>>JOAN BORYSENKO: I have
a great deal of faith

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.260 align:middle line:10%
that this universe
is a friendly place.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact,
GaiamTV.com is

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:09.290 align:middle line:84%
destined to become the largest
portal of conscious media,

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:10.810 align:middle line:90%
intended to awaken and inspire.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.935 align:middle line:10%
>>JEAN HOUSTON: We don't
just live in the universe.

00:28:12.935 --> 00:28:14.201 align:middle line:10%
The universe lives in us.

00:28:14.201 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I could not be
happier with this partnership

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.847 align:middle line:84%
and the possibilities that
lie ahead for all of us.

00:28:18.847 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. JOE DISPENZA:
Most people really

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.790 align:middle line:10%
are thinking the same way
every day, acting the same way,

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:10%
and feeling the same way,
but really hoping something

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.804 align:middle line:10%
will show up differently
in their life.

00:28:27.804 --> 00:28:28.570 align:middle line:10%
And it never does.

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Other well known faces
in the alternative media scene

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:10%
will also be collaborating
with GaimTV.com

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.119 align:middle line:10%
to provide even
more perspectives.

00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:36.660 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD C. HOAGLAND:
Did the Mayans

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:10%
understand about
hyperdimensional torsion field

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:41.530 align:middle line:10%
physics?

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:90%
I think I can prove they did.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In addition to my
live interviews from Gaiam TV

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:84%
studios, Scott and I
will still be traveling

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.541 align:middle line:84%

>>HARVEY BIGELSEN: You've got
pharmaceutical commercials

00:28:53.873 --> 00:28:55.880 align:middle line:10%
telling you, go to
see your doctor this,

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.990 align:middle line:10%
go to tell your doctor that.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.092 align:middle line:10%
It's a brainwashing.

00:28:59.092 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Meanwhile,
I wanted to give you

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.610 align:middle line:10%
a quick preview of
GaiamTV.com so you

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:10%
can see what's being
made available for you

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:07.030 align:middle line:10%
as a result of this partnership.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:09.030 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL TELLINGER: This
was in the late 1400s.

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.310 align:middle line:10%
When they asked the
local African tribes,

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.750 align:middle line:10%
who built these structures?

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:90%
The answer was, we don't know.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.640 align:middle line:84%
That is not what you'll in
read in history books today.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.080 align:middle line:90%
I have a big problem what that.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'll find curated
consciousness-expanding films,

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:84%
thought-provoking documentaries,
engaging TV shows,

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.960 align:middle line:90%

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the most
challenging issues that we're

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.320 align:middle line:84%
looking at these days
is immunizations.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of information,
disinformation, misinformation,

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and fear surrounding
them, particularly

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.740 align:middle line:84%
where our children
are concerned.

00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And you've spent a great
deal of time on this.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.825 align:middle line:84%
What is the number now
before the age of five,

00:30:02.825 --> 00:30:05.540 align:middle line:84%
the number of immunizations
little children are exposed to?

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Every day
it seems to change.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.456 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Something like 90.

00:30:08.456 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: 60, 50.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:10%
It depends if you count
in the booster shots.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:10%
There are more than
anyone could ever

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.260 align:middle line:10%
have imagined that were going
to take place are taking place.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.752 align:middle line:10%
It seems like you
must be spending

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:21.960 align:middle line:10%
every day getting vaccinated.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:90%


00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are delicate
little, pink, tiny beings

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.109 align:middle line:84%
that theoretically have
a built-in immune system.

00:30:33.109 --> 00:30:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yes, or they don't
have a built-in immune system

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:38.162 align:middle line:84%
and they're still learning
to build an immune system.

00:30:38.162 --> 00:30:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
part of the process.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.328 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: And
so now we're going

00:30:41.328 --> 00:30:44.390 align:middle line:84%
to vaccinate them to make
sure that we substitute

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:84%
medical immunity
for the immunity

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.740 align:middle line:84%
that their immune
systems naturally

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.050 align:middle line:84%
would provide if
we left them alone.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:84%
We can't leave them
alone, certainly not.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.130 align:middle line:84%
We can't look back on
a time in our history

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and see that children
that were left alone

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:84%
turned out fine,
like my generation.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Gee, things turned
out all right.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have 30.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:11.827 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have 60.

00:31:11.827 --> 00:31:13.160 align:middle line:90%
I never would have stood for it.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.210 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you that.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Never would have happened.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Don't care what my
parents would've said.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.830 align:middle line:84%
I can just tell
you, knowing myself,

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.875 align:middle line:90%
never would have happened.

00:31:22.875 --> 00:31:26.140 align:middle line:90%


00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.920 align:middle line:84%
There is not one
study that has ever

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.555 align:middle line:84%
been done with a large group
of children-- I mean large,

00:31:34.555 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:90%
a few thousand-- matched groups.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Half receives the vaccine.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:10%
Half doesn't.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:47.010 align:middle line:10%
They're similar in nutritional
status and medical history.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking as close
as we can the same groups.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.060 align:middle line:10%
Half get the vaccine.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:53.810 align:middle line:10%
Half doesn't.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:56.470 align:middle line:10%
And then we really track
them well for three, four,

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:10%
five years, and we see
which had adverse reactions

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.970 align:middle line:10%
to the vaccine, number
one, which group?

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Or how many in the
vaccinated group?

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And how many people from the
vaccinated group got sick?

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.550 align:middle line:84%
How many people from the
unvaccinated group got sick?

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Never been that study
on any vaccine ever,

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:20.250 align:middle line:84%
so don't begin to say--
not talking to you,

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.130 align:middle line:84%
but talking to some
theoretical person out there.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Don't begin to say that we know
that scientifically this stuff

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Never been a study like that.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I've offered good
money as a journalist

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:90%
if you can show me one.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:84%
People submit various kinds
of phony little things,

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:39.964 align:middle line:84%
and I turn them back for reasons
that I've just mentioned here.

00:32:39.964 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The second thing people say
about vaccines is, well,

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.482 align:middle line:84%
of course, we know that
they have wiped out--

00:32:45.482 --> 00:32:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Polio.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT:
--tremendous diseases.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And so to which I would
say, read "Medical Nemesis"

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.780 align:middle line:84%
by Ivan Illich, who will
describe to you why contagious

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.610 align:middle line:84%
diseases really diminished
in the West over time,

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.450 align:middle line:84%
had nothing to do with
medical interventions,

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.050 align:middle line:84%
had to do with better
nutrition above all,

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.190 align:middle line:84%
creation of a middle
class, better sanitation,

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:90%
lack of overcrowding.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
best of what we would

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:84%
call perhaps modern
technological life.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that,
we have many challenges

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:22.310 align:middle line:84%
in the form of charts indicating
that these diseases, supposedly

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:84%
wiped out by vaccines,
were already on the way out

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.860 align:middle line:84%
before the vaccine
was ever introduced

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and simply continued to
diminish after the vaccine was

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:90%
introduced.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I have statements about
polio that would just

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:38.500 align:middle line:84%
fry your brain in terms of
what the doctors pretended

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and how they were paid
for a diagnosis of polio,

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.890 align:middle line:84%
so therefore the diagnosis
numbers jumped up.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.316 align:middle line:90%
We get into all of that.

00:33:47.316 --> 00:33:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let
me ask you about

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that, because my
generation, we lined up.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.880 align:middle line:90%
We took the sugar cube.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.990 align:middle line:90%
We got a few vaccines.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:57.550 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have a lot of
vaccines, MMR type of thing.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Were there side effects
from those little sugar

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:84%
cubes with the polio vaccine
in them, for example?

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yes, there were
cases of polio, for example.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.320 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the side effects.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.403 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like didn't cure
like; like caused like.

00:34:12.403 --> 00:34:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Eventually,
Jonas Salk and sugar cube

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.920 align:middle line:84%
went at each other
over and over again,

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.882 align:middle line:84%
because they had
developed, Sabin and Salk,

00:34:20.882 --> 00:34:21.840 align:middle line:90%
two different vaccines.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And they called each
other criminals and crooks

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:25.150 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Not exactly the
kind of behavior you

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:84%
would expect from medical
scientists, right?

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Common,
though, in that field.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: And yes,
there were disseminated

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:84%
cases of smallpox-- I mean,
polio from each vaccine,

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.610 align:middle line:84%
from the Salk vaccine
and the Sabin sugar cube.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:43.239 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, no
question about it.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I know for a fact
as a journalist

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:84%
that after the World
Health Organization said,

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:52.040 align:middle line:84%
we've wiped out polio,
or smallpox rather,

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:84%
in the third world in
Africa-- we've wiped it out,

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:84%
gone-- they had a secret meeting
in Geneva where they said,

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.925 align:middle line:84%
we'll never use the
smallpox vaccine again.

00:35:02.925 --> 00:35:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're
celebrating that you've

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.780 align:middle line:84%
wiped out smallpox
with the vaccine,

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.480 align:middle line:84%
why are you so afraid
of the vaccine?

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Because it caused smallpox.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it caused
cases of smallpox.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, that must mean that they
didn't really wipe it out.

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.620 align:middle line:84%
They were causing
cases of smallpox.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're lying
about the statistics.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.540 align:middle line:84%
I know that meeting
took place in Geneva.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I have an impeccable
source on it.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:29.850 align:middle line:84%
They said, never again will
we use the smallpox vaccine.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put
it on the shelf.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.380 align:middle line:84%
These people know
there are dangers

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.980 align:middle line:90%
implicit in the vaccines.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.240 align:middle line:90%
They know that.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:84%
This is why the companies,
the drug companies,

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
have negotiated with
governments, including the US

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.920 align:middle line:84%
government, to be completely off
the hook for liability in case

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.040 align:middle line:84%
of disasters from
their vaccines.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.240 align:middle line:84%
You can't any longer
sue the manufacturer

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.680 align:middle line:84%
of a vaccine in
the United States.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.494 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through
the vaccine compensation

00:35:58.494 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:84%
program of the
federal government.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you can
in other countries.

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:03.400 align:middle line:84%
There was just a recent
case that was successfully

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:84%
settled where the judge ruled
in favor of the plaintiff

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.460 align:middle line:84%
because the child--
there was a very

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.500 align:middle line:84%
direct link between
his vaccinations

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and the development
of autism in his case.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't even
need to go there.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview
with Susie Miller.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I've done other
interviews on the subject.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.860 align:middle line:90%
And Mary Toko.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:84%
There are many places for people
to go and look this one up.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Yes, there are.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.570 align:middle line:84%
There are also cases in the
United States, recent cases,

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.250 align:middle line:84%
where parents of children
have been compensated

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.250 align:middle line:90%
by the government for autism.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't call it that,
but that's what it is.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And they know-- the
government knows that--

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.478 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
go to trial, though.

00:36:42.478 --> 00:36:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: --it came from
a mercury-contained vaccine.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:84%
While the government is saying
no connection between mercury

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and autism, they're
paying out money

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.890 align:middle line:84%
to families whose
children are damaged

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:84%
by mercury-containing vaccines
with autistic spectrum,

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.620 align:middle line:84%
except they're calling
it encephalopathy.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Different, different, different.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Sure, it's happening
all the time.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you're
looking at the stats,

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:10.040 align:middle line:84%
the years that they started
intensifying the saturation

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.182 align:middle line:84%
of ingredients and the number
of vaccines that we were giving

00:37:13.182 --> 00:37:13.765 align:middle line:90%
our children--

00:37:13.765 --> 00:37:14.762 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Autism.

00:37:14.762 --> 00:37:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and autism.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.320 align:middle line:90%
They're a direct parallel.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's forget
about the autism part

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:84%
because we've made that
case, I think, enough.

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.680 align:middle line:90%
You can research that one.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at some of
the other factors involved

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.878 align:middle line:84%
with kids that are getting
all this junk thrown

00:37:28.878 --> 00:37:31.642 align:middle line:84%
into their body at
very tender ages,

00:37:31.642 --> 00:37:33.100 align:middle line:84%
some of the other
effects, and then

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.200 align:middle line:90%
also how parents can stop this.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.347 align:middle line:90%
That's a really big part of it.

00:37:37.347 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Well, first
of all, two things.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.560 align:middle line:84%
The kid is getting chemicals
and germs injected directly

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.400 align:middle line:84%
into the body that
bypass the normal portals

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:84%
of the immune system,
the defense of the skin.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.750 align:middle line:84%
The various kinds of layers of
protection against chemicals

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.970 align:middle line:84%
like formaldehyde and
mercury and against germs

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.630 align:middle line:84%
that are implanted
in the vaccines

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.160 align:middle line:84%
on purpose, and then the
accidental contamination

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.070 align:middle line:90%
of germs-- that's inevitable.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:06.450 align:middle line:84%
All of these things are-- zip--
injected right into the body.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first thing
when we talk about effects.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Now we no longer have
the immune system

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:17.230 align:middle line:84%
of the child enabled to
act against these things,

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.180 align:middle line:84%
because the gates
already are open once you

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.350 align:middle line:90%
stick a needle in.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, oh,
it's on a sandwich

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and you've got
all kinds of stuff

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.300 align:middle line:84%
that the body can do
to mount defenses.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So you've left
the child somewhat

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.780 align:middle line:90%
disabled in that respect.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:84%
That's number one
effect of what happens.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And number two is the child's
body learns the lesson.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.820 align:middle line:84%
My immune system depends upon
interventions from vaccines.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.827 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.827 --> 00:38:50.160 align:middle line:90%
This is what immunity means now.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
information that's

00:38:51.785 --> 00:38:53.070 align:middle line:90%
being projected into the body.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.194 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: The body is
receiving this information

00:38:55.194 --> 00:38:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and understands that now
this is the way it's done.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And the body is now-- believe
me-- scratching its head

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:06.426 align:middle line:84%
saying, what are we
going to do about this?

00:39:06.426 --> 00:39:10.360 align:middle line:84%
This is bad, bad for our
business as the body,

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.130 align:middle line:84%
because we're in the
business of immunity.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Taking
care of this body.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: This is
what we're all about.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we're
being told, no, you

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.570 align:middle line:84%
can't survive without
these interventions

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.040 align:middle line:84%
from these insane
people over here

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.940 align:middle line:84%
who claim that
they're preventing

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.660 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of disease.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.830 align:middle line:84%
What are they really doing
when it comes down to it?

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:28.780 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.380 align:middle line:84%
They're selling you your
own immune system back.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're doing.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Because to the degree that a
person does retain immunity

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:39.490 align:middle line:84%
to disease, it's not
because of the vaccines.

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.700 align:middle line:84%
It's because of their
own immune system,

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.930 align:middle line:84%
but the doctors are saying,
no, no, no, no, no, it's

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:46.300 align:middle line:84%
because of the vaccine
that you're really immune.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's selling you your
own immune system back twice.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Twice.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.910 align:middle line:84%
One that isn't as good as the
original one in most cases,

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.420 align:middle line:90%
not all cases but most cases.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And another interesting
thing paralleling

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.020 align:middle line:84%
this is that I've had
many health practitioners

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:09.230 align:middle line:84%
from various different areas
of usually alternative medicine

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:14.000 align:middle line:84%
say that the one disorder
or condition that's

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.610 align:middle line:84%
on the rise more than any
other is autoimmune problems.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:19.410 align:middle line:90%
It's society at large.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:22.110 align:middle line:84%
We're having a
crisis, an epidemic

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.335 align:middle line:90%
of autoimmune problems.

00:40:23.335 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Which
means the body

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:84%
is attacking some
element of itself.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And so now you've scrambled
the response of the body

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.460 align:middle line:84%
completely by
saying, we're going

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.070 align:middle line:84%
to give you immunity
from the outside.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.190 align:middle line:84%
You who are dedicated
to immunity,

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:39.960 align:middle line:84%
the body, who are all
about immunity-- that's

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.880 align:middle line:84%
why you're really around
is to provide it--

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.260 align:middle line:90%
we're going to deny you that.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.947 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, you can't
do that anymore.

00:40:46.947 --> 00:40:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
know how to do it.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:49.550 align:middle line:90%
We can do it better.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.633 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: We've got it.

00:40:50.633 --> 00:40:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Here are the injections,
one after another.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.950 align:middle line:84%
So now the body begins
to feel confused.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:59.770 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to
mobilize and figure out

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:03.550 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with this
kind of Trojan horse.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.060 align:middle line:90%
How do we deal with this?

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.430 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
it begins to do

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.445 align:middle line:84%
is misidentify certain
elements of itself

00:41:10.445 --> 00:41:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and begins attacking
them as if they're

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.610 align:middle line:84%
enemies when they're
not, because it's

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.860 align:middle line:84%
existing in the
state of confusion.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.500 align:middle line:90%
This is confusion.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many people
as a reporter I've interviewed.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever get
vaccinated growing up?

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:25.726 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:41:25.726 --> 00:41:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Did you eat pretty good?

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Pretty good.

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Exercise?

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:29.574 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:29.574 --> 00:41:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Have you had many
diseases in your life?

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:31.984 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:31.984 --> 00:41:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Are you healthy?

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:33.389 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:33.389 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are a
lot of OB/GYN doctors

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.790 align:middle line:84%
who will not allow their own
children to be vaccinated.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:38.787 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: You bet.

00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They know.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.030 align:middle line:90%
They know what's going on.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So instead the rest of us
vaccinate our children.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.280 align:middle line:90%
We've been vaccinated.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And now we end up
in a system where

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.190 align:middle line:84%
we have a broken immune
system essentially

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.350 align:middle line:90%
that can't optimally function.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Now we're in the system.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Not just autoimmune problems,
every kind of problem.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And once you get into the
system, into the matrix of it,

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:03.280 align:middle line:84%
then you have big issues
because it costs a lot of money.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.210 align:middle line:84%
There are always one
organization or drug company

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:84%
who's certainly trying to profit
at the expense of another.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's just chaos.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And now we get to the
new Health Care Act.

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.100 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is that anyway?

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I've read bits and pieces,
and portions, and assessments.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:28.590 align:middle line:84%
What does this new Health
Care Act deny us or offer us?

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.940 align:middle line:90%
What's it do?

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.369 align:middle line:90%
What's it setting us up for?

00:42:32.369 --> 00:42:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: I've got to make
one final point about vaccines.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:37.131 align:middle line:84%
I know we can't-- it's
a 12-hour conversation.

00:42:37.131 --> 00:42:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is, indeed.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: But here's
what stops parents

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.214 align:middle line:84%
from taking a hard look
at the truth of this.

00:42:44.214 --> 00:42:45.755 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid to
challenge a doctor.

00:42:45.755 --> 00:42:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we're afraid.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid of doctors.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: The
doctor say, this

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.310 align:middle line:84%
is the way it's going to be
and how dare you question me.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're also
then afraid of what

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.247 align:middle line:90%
other people are going to say.

00:42:56.247 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.520 align:middle line:90%
You're an irresponsible parent.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Peer
pressure and all of this.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.300 align:middle line:90%
You're irresponsible.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:07.220 align:middle line:84%
If you can cure people
of that, if you can say,

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.790 align:middle line:84%
does the health of your
child mean more to you,

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:12.230 align:middle line:84%
really, than what
your friends say

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and what this doctor is trying
to look down his nose at you

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.820 align:middle line:90%
and say?

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Think about which
is more important.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.762 align:middle line:84%
OK so we've come to the
new health care plan.

00:43:22.762 --> 00:43:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because now we're
all in the system because we're

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.050 align:middle line:84%
compromised on one
level or another.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:30.950 align:middle line:84%
So many children's
hospitals, so many sick kids.

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:32.976 align:middle line:90%
This is scary.

00:43:32.976 --> 00:43:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Essentially the
job of the medical system is

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:42.690 align:middle line:84%
to recast, reshape, rehypnotize,
reconfigure what happened

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:48.950 align:middle line:84%
because of a chemical,
tons of sugary drink,

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:52.380 align:middle line:84%
artificial food
coloring and dye,

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:55.820 align:middle line:84%
sensitivities to certain
kinds of things like gluten

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, vaccines--

00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Genetically
altered products.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Genetically
altered food and all of this.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if
I'm sitting here--

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm the new insurance
plan-- and I'm saying,

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.860 align:middle line:90%
and I shall recast all of this.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.760 align:middle line:84%
This will never be
called what it is.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:84%
This will never be
identified as coming

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:20.830 align:middle line:84%
from the true causes
of where it comes from.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:22.520 align:middle line:90%
This will never happen, ever.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I will provide a
complete list of all disorders

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and diseases that are legitimate
by name, by label, and what

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.770 align:middle line:84%
the treatments are allowed
for each one these.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where
this plan is going.

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:43.260 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly where
it's going up the road.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Not tomorrow, not the next
day, but it's going there.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see it, part of
it, because the Department

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:50.960 align:middle line:84%
of Health and Human
Services, which

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.240 align:middle line:84%
is a cabinet post
under the president,

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:58.230 align:middle line:84%
is tasked with exactly
this, to present people

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:02.330 align:middle line:84%
under the new plan with
a complete list of all

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:04.120 align:middle line:84%
the diseases and
mental disorders that

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.810 align:middle line:84%
exist that are now called
legitimate, you see,

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.250 align:middle line:84%
automatically, and
the allowed treatments

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:10.740 align:middle line:90%
for each one of these things.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's suddenly now,
where on the chart

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.279 align:middle line:90%
do you fit, Mr. Patient?

00:45:14.279 --> 00:45:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
has to be more one

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.510 align:middle line:84%
size fits all for diabetes
or whatever, right?

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Oh, of course.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's maybe
a spectrum of one, two,

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:23.660 align:middle line:90%
or three drugs, and that's it.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Sure,
you can have type 1.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's see, OK, you're type 2.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, here are the drugs.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, next, come up.

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Because it's all put down.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But the true causes, which we
just started talking about,

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.523 align:middle line:90%
they're already forgotten.

00:45:35.523 --> 00:45:37.110 align:middle line:84%
People say, well,
what were you saying

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.180 align:middle line:84%
back there 30 seconds
ago, Rappaport?

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Something about
environmental this or that?

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.557 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you said diabetes,
boom, we're into the medical--

00:45:45.557 --> 00:45:46.390 align:middle line:90%
we're into the list.

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:48.681 align:middle line:84%
We're into the Department of
Health and Human Services.

00:45:48.681 --> 00:45:50.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the future.

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:51.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what this plan does.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why the pharmaceutical
companies are in love with it.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.231 align:middle line:84%
That's why the insurance
companies are in love with it.

00:45:56.231 --> 00:45:58.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why the insurance
companies wrote it.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
corporations wrote it.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:01.330 align:middle line:90%
This is not liberal.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.700 align:middle line:84%
This is not progressive,
conservative.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.770 align:middle line:90%
This is corporate.

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:06.520 align:middle line:90%
This is a corporate plan.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a plan to
institutionalize

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:14.680 align:middle line:84%
the future of medicine as
pharmaceutical, profit-making,

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:18.430 align:middle line:90%
insured medicine with a list.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.340 align:middle line:90%
This is like a Bible.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.529 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a
medical Bible, folks.

00:46:22.529 --> 00:46:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
what you're allowed

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:24.884 align:middle line:84%
to have in response
to your disease.

00:46:24.884 --> 00:46:24.980 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: This is
what you're allowed.

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:90%
What's the implication of this?

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.290 align:middle line:84%
The implication is that all
those chiropractors walking

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:35.070 align:middle line:84%
around and all those
acupuncturists walking around,

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:38.700 align:middle line:84%
all those naturopaths walking
around, who are going wink,

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.970 align:middle line:90%
wink, nudge, nudge.

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:44.720 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be great for
us, because we're part of this.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:47.740 align:middle line:84%
We really are, of
the new-- whatever

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.420 align:middle line:84%
we want to call
this insurance plan.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.100 align:middle line:84%
We're really part
of this, and we'll

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.540 align:middle line:90%
be-- don't worry about us.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.040 align:middle line:90%
We're in.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.400 align:middle line:84%
We're in the inside,
because we're legitimate.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.995 align:middle line:84%
And yes, for a little while
that will be true, until one day

00:47:00.995 --> 00:47:05.250 align:middle line:84%
a chiropractor finds
himself sweeping floors

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and mopping hallways
in a hospital.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.140 align:middle line:84%
That's what chiropractic
is now allowed to do.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along the
line that is going

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:84%
to happen to acupuncturist, to
chiropractors, to naturopaths.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And people are going to say,
oh, he's such an alarmist.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.650 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm looking down
the line at the future,

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:26.270 align:middle line:84%
because this is what
pharmaceutical-based medicine

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:30.460 align:middle line:84%
has been just drooling over,
the possibility of this,

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:35.210 align:middle line:84%
for decades, has been trying
to make this happen, this plan.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:40.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the champagne night for
them with the passage of this

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and the Supreme Court ruling
on its constitutionality.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:46.367 align:middle line:84%
This has nothing to do with what
people think it has to do with.

00:47:46.367 --> 00:47:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does this
have any allowance in it

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.591 align:middle line:84%
for preventative
care, for example?

00:47:50.591 --> 00:47:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: A little bit
here and there now and then,

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.470 align:middle line:90%
but it's not going to last.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:56.779 align:middle line:90%
This is my point.

00:47:56.779 --> 00:47:57.820 align:middle line:90%
There are certain things.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.490 align:middle line:84%
If you've looked at
them long enough,

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:02.300 align:middle line:90%
you can see where they're going.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:07.570 align:middle line:84%
If I am expert on trains and
tracks and a train moves by,

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I say, do you want to
know where it's going?

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:12.195 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you all
the turns in the road

00:48:12.195 --> 00:48:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and what it's
going to look like.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you've been
watching this for decades.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:16.126 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: 30 years.

00:48:16.126 --> 00:48:17.920 align:middle line:90%
And here it is, folks.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.210 align:middle line:84%
This is what they've
been trying to do.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:22.730 align:middle line:84%
This is what was
happening in 1993.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:24.840 align:middle line:84%
This is what finally
happened now.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a pharmaceutical triumph.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:32.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a biblical triumph if
you mean medical biblical,

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.540 align:middle line:84%
because we finally
are going to have

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:38.990 align:middle line:84%
the complete list
of all the diseases.

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:40.077 align:middle line:90%
Where did this come from?

00:48:40.077 --> 00:48:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Here they are.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, a
lot of them are going

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:47.280 align:middle line:84%
on the garbage-bucket-type
diagnosis of diseases that

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.740 align:middle line:84%
aren't even real diseases that
they're treating seriously--

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:49.848 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Well, of course.

00:48:49.848 --> 00:48:50.598 align:middle line:90%
There are so many.

00:48:50.598 --> 00:48:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and just
slapping a drug on.

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: And here's
somebody out here exposed

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.060 align:middle line:84%
to a chemical,
exposed to a vaccine.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Now they have symptoms.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Now they have arthritic
symptoms at age 12.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Now they can't
digest their food.

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Now this, now that.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And they go to the doctor, and
the doctor goes, OK, let's see,

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:11.710 align:middle line:84%
the symptoms are-- OK, what
does that correspond with?

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:12.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's do a blood test.

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:16.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, all right,
you've got this, AQZ.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.664 align:middle line:90%


00:49:18.664 --> 00:49:20.330 align:middle line:84%
The mother says, does
this have anything

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:22.420 align:middle line:84%
to do with environmental
chemicals or vaccines?

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.617 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:49:25.617 --> 00:49:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's standardizing.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Are you trying
to practice medicine?

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:30.558 align:middle line:84%
Are you walking into
my office and trying

00:49:30.558 --> 00:49:31.490 align:middle line:90%
to practice medicine?

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's going on here?

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Now either you pay attention
to what science says

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.919 align:middle line:90%
or you go to your hocus pocus.

00:49:39.919 --> 00:49:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you
know what's going

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.570 align:middle line:84%
to happen under the
new health plan?

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:45.270 align:middle line:84%
If this happens in
an office, a doctor's

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:49.230 align:middle line:90%
going to say, watch out.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:50.064 align:middle line:90%
We know who you are.

00:49:50.064 --> 00:49:51.438 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
what if you don't

00:49:51.438 --> 00:49:53.240 align:middle line:84%
follow their prescribed
course of action?

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.406 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: I'm telling
you what's going to happen.

00:49:55.406 --> 00:49:56.690 align:middle line:90%
We know who you are.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:58.520 align:middle line:90%
You have your position.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:05.250 align:middle line:84%
You are patient 168912A-Q
in the insurance plan.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Now you are refusing
treatment, refusing care.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.800 align:middle line:84%
We could make room
for someone else here.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, are you going to
go along with this?

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, let's just--
clickety click click--

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:18.680 align:middle line:90%
let's look back here.

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Were you not the mother
who refused a vaccine

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:26.860 align:middle line:84%
four years ago on her
child for hepatitis ZXQ?

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you were.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And here's a case
that we built up

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:33.510 align:middle line:84%
against you of strange
little behaviors.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:36.120 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we can
now excommunicate you

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:36.980 align:middle line:90%
into the dark.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
is already happening.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.640 align:middle line:84%
People refuse
treatment and they're

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.010 align:middle line:90%
losing their insurance coverage.

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:42.426 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Right,
but it's going

00:50:42.426 --> 00:50:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to be much worse when everyone
is under the umbrella.

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Because now everyone's talking.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's part of the plan.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is android
by number, except you.

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.201 align:middle line:84%
This is no longer, you're
just out of the plan.

00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:58.200 align:middle line:90%
You're out of the world.

00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.230 align:middle line:90%
You're out of the community.

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:01.680 align:middle line:84%
You're into the outer darkness,
because people look at you

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and they say, a bane, a heretic.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not under the system.

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.900 align:middle line:90%
This will happen up the road.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, this is
where it's going.

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well,
let's look at what

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.440 align:middle line:84%
is already happening
in another area.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is if you're not
compliant-- if you're a child

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.850 align:middle line:84%
or you're a teenager and
you're not compliant,

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:22.370 align:middle line:84%
you're fidgety in class--
we all know that one.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:23.342 align:middle line:90%
ADHD.

00:51:23.342 --> 00:51:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that
you're going to be

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.420 align:middle line:84%
put on some kind of drug,
a very large percentage.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:28.360 align:middle line:90%
What is it now?

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT:
Ritalin or Adderall.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.823 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what
is the percentage

00:51:30.823 --> 00:51:32.984 align:middle line:84%
of the American
population under 18?

00:51:32.984 --> 00:51:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: You're
really talking

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.450 align:middle line:90%
about the percentage of boys.

00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:38.960 align:middle line:84%
We're talking six,
seven million boys

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.550 align:middle line:90%
in the country that are on this.

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That are on this drug.

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
be part of the system,

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:46.590 align:middle line:84%
as well, once it's called for,
once you've been diagnosed.

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Yet at the same time when
we were talking off camera,

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.660 align:middle line:84%
you told me that
there was a program

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.630 align:middle line:84%
on PBS "Frontline" you
were talking about.

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And a doctor came
on, and once they

00:51:56.230 --> 00:52:00.090 align:middle line:84%
were pushed and challenged,
they finally said--

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: We have
no test for anything.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Russell Barkley, my
hat's off to you, boy.

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Massachusetts, UMass professor
of neurology and so on.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:17.710 align:middle line:84%
The program was "Frontline
PBS," "Does ADHD really exist?"

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was asked,
is there a test?

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.080 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Then how do we know it exists?

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:29.440 align:middle line:84%
He says, people don't understand
what science really is.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand how
science really operates.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:36.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't need a test to
say something exists.

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.539 align:middle line:84%
In fact, then he
crosses the line.

00:52:38.539 --> 00:52:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
not very scientific.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: He says, if we
needed a test, a laboratory

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:48.465 align:middle line:84%
test, we would have no
mental disorders at all.

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean
there would be

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.180 align:middle line:84%
no classification
of mental disorders?

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: None of
the 297 that presently

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.120 align:middle line:84%
are listed in the
Bible of psychiatry

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:01.130 align:middle line:84%
would exist at all
because none of them

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:05.850 align:middle line:84%
has ever had a test to
confirm a diagnosis.

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:07.500 align:middle line:90%
He admits that.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.580 align:middle line:90%
He admits that.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I also have Allen Francis,
formally, perhaps even now

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:16.530 align:middle line:84%
still the most famous
psychiatrist in America,

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:19.500 align:middle line:84%
responsible for putting together
the psychiatric Bible called

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:25.170 align:middle line:84%
the DSM IV that lists all the
so-called mental disorders, say

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:29.410 align:middle line:84%
to a reporter from
"Wired" magazine in 1990--

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing
here, but this is

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:35.380 align:middle line:84%
pretty close-- there is
no way to precisely define

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:38.540 align:middle line:90%
a distinct mental disorder.

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:43.320 align:middle line:90%
That's all bull bleep.

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And he's the guy
who was in charge

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.150 align:middle line:84%
of creating the
Bible that actually

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:51.330 align:middle line:90%
defined each mental disorder.

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Folks, I'm not making this up.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just trying to
pat myself on the back.

00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:59.922 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, this is what
medical reporting should be.

00:53:59.922 --> 00:54:01.380 align:middle line:84%
This is what you're
supposed to do.

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.838 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
take these guys,

00:54:02.838 --> 00:54:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and grab them by the
neck, and stick them

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:11.020 align:middle line:84%
in front of the public, and
say, look at this famous idiot.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:12.105 align:middle line:90%
He's got all the degrees.

00:54:12.105 --> 00:54:13.188 align:middle line:90%
He's got all the prestige.

00:54:13.188 --> 00:54:14.890 align:middle line:90%
He's got all of everything.

00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:16.130 align:middle line:90%
And this is what he said.

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:17.942 align:middle line:84%
Now, does this
make sense to you?

00:54:17.942 --> 00:54:18.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:20.250 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense to me.

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we're not going
to let him off the hook.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to make this
story grow in the public mind

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.240 align:middle line:90%
until it never goes away.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:28.990 align:middle line:90%
That's our job.

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's what
I was going to ask you.

00:54:31.865 --> 00:54:33.350 align:middle line:90%
We only have a few minutes left.

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we're
being-- our immune systems

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.750 align:middle line:84%
are being compromised
through vaccines.

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:40.410 align:middle line:84%
We know that
ourselves and our kids

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:42.350 align:middle line:90%
are being unnecessarily drugged.

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:45.780 align:middle line:84%
We know we have unnecessary
procedures, operations,

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and such that are occurring
by the millions each year,

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:52.480 align:middle line:84%
which also is part of that
death statistic, death

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.980 align:middle line:90%
by medical care.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we also know
about the deaths,

00:54:56.770 --> 00:54:58.500 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about in
the very beginning,

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.640 align:middle line:90%
by approved prescription drugs.

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.770 align:middle line:90%
So we're up against quite a lot.

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:05.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to say no
to a lot of people

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:08.330 align:middle line:84%
in order to just feel
like we have the safety

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.110 align:middle line:84%
net of being covered
within a system.

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, what if
something happens?

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:14.410 align:middle line:10%
Where would I go without
my medical insurance?

00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:15.790 align:middle line:10%
That's a fear.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:17.850 align:middle line:10%
And most people listening
to this right now,

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:20.490 align:middle line:10%
that's the fear in
even listening to this.

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:23.372 align:middle line:10%
What can we do?

00:55:23.372 --> 00:55:25.580 align:middle line:10%
>>RAPPAPORT: Well, the first
thing and the last thing

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:29.080 align:middle line:10%
that people have to remember
is, do you want freedom or not?

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.860 align:middle line:10%
Do you know what it is or not?

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.770 align:middle line:10%
Because if you're
going to fudge that,

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:37.910 align:middle line:10%
pretend it's not an issue--
or what is he talking about?

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:39.472 align:middle line:84%
That's not relevant--
you're never

00:55:39.472 --> 00:55:40.930 align:middle line:84%
going to get to
the bottom of this.

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:41.840 align:middle line:90%
What is the bottom?

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:44.140 align:middle line:84%
The bottom is, do
you have the freedom

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:47.780 align:middle line:84%
to decide what to do about
your own body or not?

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Remember all those,
quote, feminists

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.650 align:middle line:84%
who were out there with
signs at the beginning

00:55:54.650 --> 00:56:00.300 align:middle line:84%
of the 1970s, the
late '60s-- my body.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I decide what to
do with my body.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, so here we are
with the same issue

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.120 align:middle line:90%
except in different terms.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying I support
or don't support abortion.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.110 align:middle line:84%
What I'm talking about here
is I'm talking about freedom,

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:16.270 align:middle line:84%
the freedom to decide, I want
a drug, I don't want the drug.

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I think this
is a good procedure.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.711 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it.

00:56:18.711 --> 00:56:19.332 align:middle line:90%
Or not.

00:56:19.332 --> 00:56:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how do
you do this in light

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.240 align:middle line:84%
of a system that doesn't
allow you to have the freedom

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.340 align:middle line:90%
to make that choice?

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Or you're simply off the books
and you have no safety net,

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.030 align:middle line:84%
as really that's
all health insurance

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:33.570 align:middle line:90%
is viewed as, a safety net.

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: You decide
what's more important,

00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:37.410 align:middle line:90%
your freedom or the system.

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:39.540 align:middle line:84%
If you decide your
freedom is more important,

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:42.904 align:middle line:84%
you will build something
outside the system.

00:56:42.904 --> 00:56:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's not
as though there are not

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of building
blocks at our disposal.

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:48.003 align:middle line:90%
>>RAPPAPORT: Oh, it's unlimited.

00:56:48.003 --> 00:56:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The technologies
that are emerging

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:54.230 align:middle line:84%
by the day that are
literally reversing diseases,

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:57.140 align:middle line:84%
the amount of knowledge we
have alone in terms of being

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.470 align:middle line:84%
able to suss out
where the disease

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:02.150 align:middle line:84%
or where the chronic illness
came from to begin with,

00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:04.380 align:middle line:90%
and nutrition-- you go on.

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.510 align:middle line:90%
You finish it.

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:08.910 align:middle line:84%
What is at our fingertips if we
choose to use it and basically

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:10.690 align:middle line:90%
walk from the system?

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Astounding
amounts of stuff.

00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:15.820 align:middle line:84%
My wife is the best nutritional
detective on the planet.

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I've seen her do
unbelievable things

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:21.740 align:middle line:84%
with people who came to her
after seeing other people,

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and this and that,
and this and that.

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:25.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's get to
the bottom of this,

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.070 align:middle line:84%
the bottom of the
bottom of the bottom.

00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:31.660 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing what you
can do when you're not

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:35.920 align:middle line:84%
talking about being
unfree, when you

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.910 align:middle line:84%
don't like that, when
that's not it for you.

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And this game is not
over, believe me.

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also taking
the path of freedom

00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:48.010 align:middle line:90%
is a very exciting one.

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.780 align:middle line:84%
It's opening up so
many possibilities

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.130 align:middle line:84%
to genuinely recover
yourself, mentally,

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:55.640 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, physically,
and spiritually.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.972 align:middle line:90%
Just to make that decision.

00:57:56.972 --> 00:57:58.930 align:middle line:84%
By they way, I have a
copy of your wife's book.

00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:01.780 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Our Children
Are What Our Children Eat."

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And she also-- I just
want to bring this up.

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.450 align:middle line:84%
She talks about the fact that if
your child does go in and have

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.480 align:middle line:84%
their inoculations
for whatever reason,

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.010 align:middle line:84%
she can tell you
how to prep them--

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:12.968 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't found your
way out of the system

00:58:12.968 --> 00:58:14.390 align:middle line:84%
yet-- how to prep
them, what foods

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:17.520 align:middle line:84%
will start helping their bodies
to accept it a little better

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.220 align:middle line:90%
and also to detox afterwards.

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
work she's doing.

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts?

00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:25.132 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
minute or so left.

00:58:25.132 --> 00:58:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: I have
to reiterate and say,

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.460 align:middle line:90%
do you know what freedom is?

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.809 align:middle line:84%
If you do, you're
on the right path.

00:58:30.809 --> 00:58:32.600 align:middle line:84%
If you don't or you're
not sure, you better

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.600 align:middle line:84%
figure it, because this
is coming to a crossroads

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.460 align:middle line:84%
here where the
system wants to say,

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:42.100 align:middle line:84%
you have to be part of what we
have and we know what's right.

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.632 align:middle line:90%
We have science on our side.

00:58:44.632 --> 00:58:46.715 align:middle line:84%
And you have to decide,
if I'm not accepting this,

00:58:46.715 --> 00:58:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and if I'm free,
then what do I do?

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.050 align:middle line:90%
How do I work?

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And there are things
you can do, believe me.

00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:56.700 align:middle line:84%
You can build outside
of the system.

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to decide
what's more important,

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:00.990 align:middle line:90%
the system or your freedom.

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:03.800 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note,
thank you so much.

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I know people have gotten a
tremendous amount of not only

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:10.670 align:middle line:84%
encouragement but
permission to go outside

00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:11.990 align:middle line:90%
of the system listening to you.

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, John.

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RAPPAPORT: Or they're
scared out of it, right?

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably a
little of that, too.

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:19.625 align:middle line:84%
We've shared this for one
reason, to encourage each of us

00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:22.340 align:middle line:84%
to ask new questions and not to
blindly listen to the evening

00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.370 align:middle line:84%
news where our
health is concerned.

00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:26.230 align:middle line:84%
