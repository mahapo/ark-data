>>REGINA MEREDITH: Sarah
Breskman Cosme's search

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.810 align:middle line:10%
for forgotten legacies has
taken her to Avalon this time.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:10%
She and a group of souls who
feel a connection with Avalon

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:10%
dove into their subconscious
memories of ancient times

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
and uncovered some
fascinating possibilities.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.067 align:middle line:10%
Sarah, it's wonderful to
see you again, as always.

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:10%
>>SARAH BRESKMAN COSME: Thank
you so much for having me.

>>REGINA: You've been
having all kinds of fun.

00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
You've been working with
a lot of different people.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Here, you worked with-- you've
worked with Robert Grant.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:90%
You've worked with MatÃ­as.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.623 align:middle line:84%
You're starting to do
some high-profile people.

00:00:49.623 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're not divulging what
you're learning through them

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:84%
because this is
their private stuff,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.695 align:middle line:84%
but you've been
going places, girl.

in our first little interview.

00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Oh, my gosh, I know.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So amazing to think about
how much has changed.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So much has changed.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:10%
And you're even popular enough
you're getting lots of hate mail

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:10%
now.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.433 align:middle line:90%
Yay, you've made it.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: I made it.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've got
conspiracies around you.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:10%
That means you've
really made it, so.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
That's what my mom said.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:84%
It's so nice to have
a supportive mother.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So we're going to
be talking about Britannia

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:10%
and ancient times Avalon.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:10%
And just this year,
I went to Tintagel.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't been to--

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't been to Cornwall
or Tintagel before.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And just being out
on that windswept,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:84%
rocky precipice with
the wind coming in

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and the sea crashing
in, but there

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:90%
was something else about it.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.730 align:middle line:10%
This was a place that held
a lot of ancient knowledge,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:10%
particularly from Atlantis
and Atlantean times.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So I just found it fascinating
to meditate there and be

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:90%
soaked in that energy.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us, first
of all, about how

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:90%
this started coming up.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.190 align:middle line:10%
Had the people been to
Britain and ancient places

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:10%
in Britain before that you
were doing regressions on,

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:10%
or did it just come up in
these regressions randomly?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Oh, my gosh.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:10%
It's so fascinating to
me because, no, they

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:10%
hadn't been there before.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:10%
And I never know what
the higher self is

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:10%
going to have me write about.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had no idea that I
would be writing about Avalon.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:90%
No idea.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:10%
And so it just, all
of a sudden, started

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:10%
flowing in a way that
just seemed by accident.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:10%
But all these people
came in for their session

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:10%
not even knowing
each other or knowing

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:10%
what I was uncovering and
bringing pieces to the story

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:10%
all about this
mystical place, Avalon.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:10%
And what's so fascinating is
that there is an energy there

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:10%
in the UK.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: But
it's not only there.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:90%
That energy is all around us.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:10%
It's almost as if
Avalon is everywhere,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:10%
but we just can't see it,
almost like this other realm

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.535 align:middle line:10%
I started learning about.

00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, yes.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Very realm
and the other realms and levels

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:90%
of Avalon.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
It's so mystical,
and it's magical

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
even because I think for so
long, in so many centuries,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:84%
we've forgotten that
we're magical beings,

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and this magic is what's
starting to resurface.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so
needed as we move forward

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:90%
in this upcoming evolution.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.747 align:middle line:84%
And our attachment--
not our attachment.

00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Our connection with the
land herself and also

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:90%
with all the elementals.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.297 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into all
that in a little bit.

00:03:42.297 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But why don't we start with
regression with Christy

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.885 align:middle line:90%
and just dive right into it?

00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: OK.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Christy was so interesting
because she didn't even know me,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and she came in for
her session because she

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
watched a show with
you and I. And she

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:90%
thought that I worked with her.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:10%
So in her first session--

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:10%
so it was pretty
much a long story,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:10%
but she found the money for
her session in her garden.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In her garden?

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: In her garden.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the fairies
gave her the money?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Exactly.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Good start.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: I know.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Came in for her session.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And right away, she brought new
information where Jen left off.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did
she know Jen's story?

00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: She didn't.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Had she read anything?

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what I love is when--
like with Dolores Cannon,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:90%
where she'd be--

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.110 align:middle line:90%
your mentor.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.708 align:middle line:84%
She'd be doing a
regression, and the beings

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:84%
would come in and
tell her something,

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and then someone else entirely
didn't know anything about it.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:90%
She'd pick right up.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:90%
And I love that.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.238 align:middle line:90%
It's good validation.

00:04:41.238 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
It's so fascinating

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
because it's like there
is a behind the scenes who

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:90%
is working with me.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure it's not just me.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure everyone's
experiencing something

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:10%
like that in their life
where there's some magic.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:10%
There is some force that you
become aware of that's unseen,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:10%
and you start to realize
something is working to help me.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So tell us where Jen
left off and then tell us

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
where Christy started
going with the story.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: So
Jen left off basically

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
where she gave this information,
this magical information

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and power from her
place of Lemuria.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Gave it to this
woman in Atlantis.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:10%
This woman took
this information--

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:10%
because information
is power in a sense--

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:10%
took this information
and ended up

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:10%
on this island about 100 miles
off of Ireland, actually.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And this island we came to
understand was Hy-Brasil.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And so she took this
knowledge there.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And after generations,
that island was destroyed.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But there were some
survivors, and those survivors

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:84%
ended up taking this knowledge
and some of the red crystals

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.933 align:middle line:84%
to the family who Christie
had in a past life.

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: So here, this
information resurfaces back

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:10%
to me, and I was just in shock.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what more
did she share with you

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:84%
about those times and the red
crystals as used in Avalon?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: So in Avalon--

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:84%
well, when it comes
to Avalon, these women

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
were working with
these red crystals.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:84%
The red crystals
came from Atlantis.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So they were used in
Atlantis, and then

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:84%
this being that called himself
Three that went by Toth

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:84%
found a group of people that
he decided he wanted to teach.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:10%
And these people
were Atlanteans who

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:10%
had lost their children
during that time.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:10%
And they were ready
to learn from him.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And he told them that they
needed to leave Atlantis

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and to take with them some of
these crystals, some scrolls,

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and artifacts and understand
certain knowledge,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
even gave them information
about this white powder that I

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
came to understand was
called monatomic gold.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And all this stuff is
new to me because--

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:90%
I learn it through my sessions.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're just doing
hypnotherapy sessions for weight

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
loss, et cetera, when
all this happened.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yeah.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the survivors
took this information,

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and they hid some of
it under the Sphinx.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
hide some of it

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:84%
in floorboards in
their houses in Egypt.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it became
apparent that it

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:84%
would be too dangerous
to keep these crystals

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:90%
and this information in Egypt.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:10%
So it was taken by some
of the Knights Templar,

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:10%
and they hid it as
the crown jewels

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:10%
in this royal family
in Scotland's place.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:10%
When the Templars were
working with this royal family

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:10%
and guarding their jewels, there
were these Druid Wizards there

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:10%
that taught the Templars
some really spiritual things.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:10%
And this trickled down, and the
Templars learned a lot of things

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:10%
from these really
powerful people.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:10%
And it really changed the
course of history in a sense

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:10%
because not only did the
Templars have this experience,

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:10%
but this royal family did too.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:28.810 align:middle line:10%
And so it gets into this
really special bloodline

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:10%
that I started learning about.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.622 align:middle line:90%
So what is--

00:08:31.622 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.705 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: OK.

00:08:33.705 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:84%
This is so-- well, this is
what I find so fascinating.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
bloodline that had

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
to be very protected that came
from Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:10%
And according to
people's memories,

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:10%
as I'm researching
their memories,

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:10%
they remember that
Jesus had children.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:10%
And in your genetics, you
have all the information

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:10%
from your ancestors
actually in your bloodline.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:10%
Well, Jesus's bloodline is still
flowing through a population,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:10%
our population today.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And there is an upcoming
experience with all this energy

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:84%
where that bloodline is
starting to become activated.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:10%
But here is the thing that
the higher consciousness

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:10%
in my clients, as
they're under hypnosis,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:10%
was saying, is that when you've
had an encounter or a past life,

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:10%
that gives you a
spiritual bloodline.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So your spiritual bloodline
starts to activate.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So actually, it's not
just this DNA activation

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
that we're experiencing now
and about to experience.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:90%
It's our soul DNA reawakening.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:90%
So we all play a part in this.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's really,
really interesting

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
that this bloodline
had to be protected.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:10%
But if you had any part in this
experience or during those times

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:10%
at all, your soul
DNA is going to be

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.648 align:middle line:10%
activated-- is being
activated right now, actually.

00:10:12.648 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:90%
It brings up all kinds of stuff.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to just launch
and do a little share,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll get back to what
else you have dug up there.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So many years ago, Dolores,
as you know, regressed me.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.020 align:middle line:90%
We talked about this before.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.085 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up-- the
part of the story

00:10:30.085 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
talked about was

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
that when I was in that temple
and that destruction, which

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe was the middle
destruction of Atlantis which

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:84%
is documented in her book, we
were all training the younger

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:90%
girls.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But the younger
girls had massive--

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had very
long life spans then.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The younger girls had a
vast amount of knowledge.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And we sent them out because we
knew the destruction was coming.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knew it.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:10%
And we sent them to what
you would call Avalon.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:84%
The girl in
particular that I was

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:84%
raising in this tradition
with these skill sets

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:90%
was sent to Avalon.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this lifetime,
she's super psychic.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:90%
She's a druid.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:10%
She didn't go through the
devastation like we did.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:10%
The souls that went
down were damaged.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.020 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there was a
certain amount of trauma.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
She never went
through the trauma

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:90%
but maintained her abilities.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And I know her well in
this lifetime, actually.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And we do joint
regressions together

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
where she's seeing her
side, and I'm seeing mine.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
sent people there seeded

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:84%
with that knowledge, just like
what you're talking about.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:84%
It was important for it to be
seeded there and not forgotten.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And they became
what became known

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
at later as the
druids, the really

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:90%
powerful alchemical druids.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it had to be
hidden somewhere.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't do these
practices in the forest

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
because if someone stumbled
upon you, they would find you.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So it is really thanks
to Avalon that we

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of these
artifacts, actually.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.362 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a lot of it was put
for the permanent library of it.

00:12:07.362 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yeah.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And what was so fascinating
to me is that I didn't--

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:84%
so as I'm getting
all this information

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:84%
from so many
different subjects, I

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:84%
didn't know that Avalon was tied
to the Knights Templar at all.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know this until
I had this client come

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.025 align:middle line:10%
in for her session,
and she was like--

00:12:31.025 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Is this Megan
you're talking about?

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: This is Megan.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: She
was a clear channel.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, oh, my gosh.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like Jen?

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Like Jen.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really crystal clear?

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: I even could
find out the name of the man

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:90%
that she was during this time.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a
really deep detail that's

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:90%
hard to get in regression.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.448 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Oh, I know.

00:12:51.448 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:90%
She's so crystal clear.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So what her role was
was she was a seaman.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So she would transport
goods across the sea.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
She spent most of her
life on a boat as a man.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:90%
So she's a man in that lifetime.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars saw her
crew, and they wanted--

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:84%
they actually asked
him if they would

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:90%
work with them, the Templars.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And so Megan, in that past life,
was like, oh OK, yeah, sure,

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
because they seem really
nice, and they wanted

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.170 align:middle line:90%
them to transport something.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So then we came to understand
the Templars taught them

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:84%
how to transport their
artifacts and their goods.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I literally could
trace where these went.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:38.830 align:middle line:90%
I actually know--

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.918 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
--where they are.

00:13:40.918 --> 00:13:41.770 align:middle line:90%
And they're in--

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Share?

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: They are in
a little island in Nova Scotia,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:84%
buried miles deep because her
memories were crystal clear.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:90%
So they would take--

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:90%
they would-- they went--

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.970 align:middle line:84%
they were on this
island where they

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.070 align:middle line:84%
were taught by the
Templars, some island

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:90%
called Catalina, near Spain.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were taught
by the Templars

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:90%
all these different things.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.440 align:middle line:10%
The Templars told them all
these different practices

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:10%
to help them become
very spiritually aware,

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:10%
practices that were so
interesting like putting

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:10%
your tailbone on the Earth and
your feet at the same time,

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:10%
sitting cross-legged, and
your hands on the ground

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:10%
because the chakras
in your hands

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:10%
and the soles of your
feet and your tailbone

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:10%
would make a connection
with the Earth.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is you focus
on the heart of Mother Earth

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.980 align:middle line:90%
beating.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, you develop
a beautiful relationship

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:90%
with Mother Earth.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a different
type of grounding.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars
taught them all about

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:84%
when you want to
receive messages,

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:55.080 align:middle line:84%
to stand in the water,
when the moon is shining

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.150 align:middle line:84%
and the sun is going down
with your feet in the water,

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and that opens you
up to be a receiver.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And so she learned all
these different really cool

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: And even
drinking the moon water

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:84%
in the morning to
receive more messages.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was how she learned
how to navigate certain things

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:90%
as this man in that life.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So then they were transporting
all these artifacts.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:90%
But this was so cool to me.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.780 align:middle line:84%
One day, the Templars
came along with them.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.250 align:middle line:10%
They normally didn't.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:84%
They normally would
just send them

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.200 align:middle line:84%
to deliver these artifacts
to this island in Nova Scotia

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:90%
by themselves.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:84%
But one journey, the
Templars came with them.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's because they were
transporting the Holy Grail.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what
is the Holy Grail?

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was figurative,
like this grail was symbolic.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'd always heard.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.830 align:middle line:90%
But no, it was an actual thing.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:01.500 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- they called
it the cup of life.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:90%
And Jesus used to have it.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see these
religious ceremonies when

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:90%
they're using this chalice--

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chalice.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: --it wasn't
really done in the same way

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:90%
that you see.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:10%
What it was and the
way Jesus used it

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:10%
and why this grail
is so important

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:10%
is that every time there's
a reset or a civilization

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.190 align:middle line:10%
is destroyed, there
always has to be

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:10%
some artifact that survives.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.600 align:middle line:10%
And this grail has
survived all of them.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So this grail, what it does
when you use it is you actually

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:90%
drink from the spirit.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
There's actually nothing in
this grail in people's memories,

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:90%
in the subconscious memories.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
nothing in this cup.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:90%
It's just the spirit.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And so as you pass it
around with your group--

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
or what Jesus did in
people's memories,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:84%
they would pass it around
and drink from it--

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:84%
it would connect you
with the other side.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:10%
And it's not that it gives
you eternal life in this life.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:84%
It just connects you
with eternal life

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
because you are alive
on the other side.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
perpetual creation.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And so every realm
has another side.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And once you really
develop your connection

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:84%
with yourself on
the other side, you

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
realize that life
is not that serious,

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and you stop worrying about
anything because this place is

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:84%
just the schoolroom,
and the other side is

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:84%
a replica of our life
just more vibrant, better,

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's where we always
are anyway basically.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:84%
That's where we exist,
but we just come here

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:90%
for a short period of time.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, going back
to this exciting day when

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing this
session, so my client

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:10%
could remember that the
Templars were there,

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:10%
and he could feel the grail
as they were transporting it.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they hid it back where
they hid all the other treasure

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:90%
on this island.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:10%
And it was so cool
because the way

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:21.310 align:middle line:10%
she was describing the way
they hid the treasure was they

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:10%
put it in these--

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:10%
place.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it was so amazing the
way they built this structure

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:10%
where they hid the treasure
underneath miles and miles deep,

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.730 align:middle line:10%
and it's in layers.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you find a
surface treasure,

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
you think you found the
treasure, but it's not.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And then she said her
crew put little clues.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.683 align:middle line:84%
So they put some of
their buttons around--

00:18:47.683 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.142 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
--some belt buckles

00:18:50.142 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:10%
here and there and some of
their musket gun pellets

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:10%
or whatever just to act as
clues so people would think

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:10%
there was something there.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so by the
time she finished this,

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.580 align:middle line:84%
did it seem to you
that it's because it's

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
to be re-identified
in this lifetime

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.083 align:middle line:84%
or even to resurface
in this lifetime?

00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
It's supposed to, yes.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- yeah,
and it's going

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
to resurface pretty soon,
which is really interesting.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And some of the red
crystals are there too.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Some are hidden in other places.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is there
an excavation that's

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be happening?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:90%
In Nova Scotia.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.310 align:middle line:90%
So to be continued on that.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing
about the Knight--

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Freddy Silva's work
on the Knight Templar

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:90%
is really, really good.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:46.140 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things I've
gotten from this over time

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:10%
is that there are beings who
come here by choice to help out,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:10%
and they always come.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:10%
And between lives, they
go someplace different.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:00.390 align:middle line:10%
And they're just suspended
there and come back

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:10%
to continue helping with
transitions and important

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:10%
periods of time.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're called the
followers of the sun,

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:84%
the followers of Horus,
the children of the sun.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And they have to do
with the fourth realm,

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.770 align:middle line:84%
whereas many beings that
go to the fourth realm

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.540 align:middle line:90%
don't bother coming back here.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It's like-- done with that.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But they do keep
people well-protected

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:84%
who are here for serious,
transformative work.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.352 align:middle line:84%
So just like you saw,
protecting that family, right?

00:20:34.352 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yeah.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And protecting this
knowledge that was brought back.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So in my understanding
in all my years of study,

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:90%
this is very real.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.150 align:middle line:84%
These people are protected
in those bloodlines

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
because I was talking
about that with Marguerite

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:84%
in another interview, who
does work with Mother Mary.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:10%
These entities are-- each
time frame brings them back

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:10%
with a different
identity, but it's

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:10%
the same entities coming back,
very, very mass entities that

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.030 align:middle line:10%
can create, that can connect
individually with us,

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:10%
and that are here to
help us through times.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's wonderful that
they're seeing this

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and that you're learning all of
this, that this has come back

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:90%
for us to rediscover now.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Yes, it's so exciting.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And what you said about
protection, it's so true.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.023 align:middle line:10%
I mean, when the higher self of
my clients speaks through them,

00:21:30.023 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:10%
they always say
there's absolutely

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.070 align:middle line:10%
no real need for protection
actually because you are God.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:10%
And so a lot of people
can believe in something,

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:10%
and that's the only reason
you would need protection

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.362 align:middle line:10%
is if you believe
you need protection.

00:21:45.362 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and maybe
just on the physical plane,

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:84%
if you're putting
yourself out there

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and your physical
presence is in jeopardy,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.567 align:middle line:84%
but that physical presence
is needed at that time.

00:21:55.567 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.983 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think people
that are here for purpose

00:21:58.983 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:84%
are looked after if it's for
higher purpose because you

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
don't want that
body disappearing

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:90%
right now when it's needed.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Right.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that makes
sense that there's

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:84%
physical third-dimensional
protection, yeah.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.585 align:middle line:90%
But as a soul, no.

00:22:12.585 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Well--
oh, yeah, of course.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But they've also said that
the power of the Red Cross,

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:90%
the equal-armed Templar cross--

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.308 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: --is
actually extremely protective.

00:22:24.308 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle line:90%
I never even knew this before.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.043 align:middle line:84%
And they said it has amazing
effects if you wear one.

00:22:30.043 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you wore one
and got a bunch of hate mail.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yeah,
I heard the rumor was

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of the Illuminati,
but I'm not, actually.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: I would
have a nicer car if I was.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Definitely.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about moving
from the Knight Templar, which

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:10%
I have a very, very strong
affinity with in my own family.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And my son and I used to
have dreams of my father

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, and I'd have
dreams of my father and son.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.125 align:middle line:10%
And I was a female
between the generations.

00:23:03.125 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Both of them were Templars.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:84%
But it was fascinating to
look at what they were doing

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:90%
and caring back in the day.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.218 align:middle line:90%
So I love them.

00:23:12.218 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: They are so--

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
were not crusaders

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:22.240 align:middle line:84%
marauding through the Middle
East, raping everyone.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.330 align:middle line:84%
These were armed forces that
were used back in that day.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.840 align:middle line:84%
But these were people
of a much higher order

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that worked with the Cistercian
priests and so forth.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: But what was
interesting is that my client,

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.460 align:middle line:90%
her teacher--

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.930 align:middle line:84%
so she was not a Templar, but
she worked with the Templars.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:10%
Her teacher, this man
who was a Templar,

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.730 align:middle line:10%
developed a relationship
with a woman from Avalon.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:10%
And they had a different
type of relationship.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.730 align:middle line:84%
They had a beautiful, spiritual,
a romantic relationship.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: They didn't
have children, actually.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It was all romance, all divine
masculine with divine feminine,

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:90%
and they cultivated that.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was a beautiful
relationship.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And what the higher
self said was,

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.510 align:middle line:84%
that's the template
for the relationships

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:90%
that are starting now--

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
--that a lot of people--

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.660 align:middle line:84%
the higher self of my
clients said a lot of people

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:84%
are having issues with
their relationships

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:26.928 align:middle line:90%
because things are changing.

00:24:26.928 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And with procreation.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.425 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Yeah, with procre--

00:24:29.425 --> 00:24:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fertility.

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Exactly.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're changing
into this new paradigm

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:84%
where we're going
to start rebalancing

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.080 align:middle line:90%
each other in a deeper way.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So relationships will
take on a new meaning

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
as this ancient stuff starts
to become more activated.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.440 align:middle line:10%
When your memories get
activated and triggered,

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:10%
then it changes
everything about you,

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.870 align:middle line:10%
and you seek out
these ancient truths,

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:10%
and you stop playing small.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:90%
You realize who you really are.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So they were talking about
how that spiritual bloodline

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:84%
with everyone connected to this
is being activated and changing

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Interesting that you
bring this up too.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman in our
archives named Gates McKibbin,

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and she wrote a series
of books about this kind

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.830 align:middle line:90%
of sacred relationship.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
in ancient Britannia.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Just what you're
talking about, exactly

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:90%
that kind of relationship.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a pair that
keeps incarnating together

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and brings this same
love, respectful love,

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:90%
through in each incarnation.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody hasn't seen
Gates McKibbin's books too,

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.670 align:middle line:84%
it exemplifies that,
and it's so beautiful.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, you would
probably love it.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.740 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.860 align:middle line:10%
So now we're talking
about-- we'll

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:10%
get into hybrids and
elementals and all that,

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:10%
but you say here that Avalon
children are returning.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:58.565 align:middle line:90%
The Avalon children--

00:25:58.565 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bringing that
knowledge back from,

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.713 align:middle line:84%
I would argue, even
Atlantean times.

00:26:02.713 --> 00:26:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, 100%.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they had a
really specific marker,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:84%
they've said, where
usually, they're

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:84%
children born after 2013 because
13 is a really special number,

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and it signifies the arrival
of these new children.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can kind of tell when
you see one of these children.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:10%
I mean, of course, I'm sure
there's some born before,

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:10%
but you can tell
when you see them.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:10%
And there's
something about them.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.810 align:middle line:10%
They can already see into
these other dimensions.

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they're
resurfacing right now

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.450 align:middle line:84%
is they're trying to bridge
the gap between humanity

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:90%
and this fairy realm.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.680 align:middle line:84%
They can see fairies,
and they can only

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:84%
be born into a family that has
at least one parent that allows

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.950 align:middle line:90%
that cultivation of belief.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't come into a
family where it's not there.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.520 align:middle line:10%
And these children
are really here

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.160 align:middle line:10%
to start to teach
us the ancient ways.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:10%
They're already designed and
made for this new evolution.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's nothing
you need to teach them.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:10%
I mean, keep them alive, but
they're here to teach us.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And listen to them.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that gets
us to the subject

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.030 align:middle line:84%
of working with the
elemental realms in general.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And we had Tanis
Helliwell on recently,

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:24.870 align:middle line:84%
who's written books about
the elementals and a summer

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.900 align:middle line:90%
with a leprechaun.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.240 align:middle line:84%
She's been seeing them
since she was little and has

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:84%
described the uniqueness of each
of the elementals in her books.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.070 align:middle line:10%
So from what these people that
you've regressed are saying,

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.810 align:middle line:10%
tell us about why they're
bringing this information

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:10%
forward about the
elementals now.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: So the
elementals are all around us.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
elementals in another realm,

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:84%
but there's also elementals
that live within this realm.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:90%
We just can't see them.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:84%
They have placed a veil so
that we couldn't see them.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.560 align:middle line:84%
But now that our consciousness
is starting to raise,

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:90%
we will be able to see them.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:10%
And so there's a gap that's
starting to be bridged.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.090 align:middle line:10%
They're all around us.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.420 align:middle line:10%
And actually, the
higher selves keep

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.790 align:middle line:10%
saying that it's beneficial
to start working with them

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:20.270 align:middle line:10%
but to do so in a way where
you completely respect them.

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Even just find out more
about elementals and fairies

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and never destroy a little
ring of mushrooms or something

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.550 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:36.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you go about it with
respect and honor of Mother

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Earth, they in turn can really
work with you and help you.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And they really like
fingernail clippings,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:84%
which is the weirdest thing
they've told me they like.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you mean fingernail--

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Yeah, they like--

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They like
fingernail clippings?

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it has
a lot of DNA in it.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Oh, interesting.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:90%
But the fairies are ancient.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:90%
They haven't changed their form.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
They're ancient, and they have
a lot of abilities and knowledge

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:90%
that they can pass on to people.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And they do stay in this
realm to work with us.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
growth for them

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:13.057 align:middle line:84%
when they work with us and
by staying in this realm.

00:29:13.057 --> 00:29:14.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's what
Tanis's work with them

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:10%
has also shown, exactly that.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: What I
find really fascinating too

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:84%
is that there's always talk
about fairy dust, pixie dust.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.670 align:middle line:10%
And what I didn't
know is-- what that is

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:31.510 align:middle line:10%
or what I've heard it
is, is that these fairies

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:37.300 align:middle line:10%
can create so much joy that
when their joy comes together,

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.360 align:middle line:10%
it sparks, and it
creates a dust,

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.190 align:middle line:10%
and that you can go out if
you want to work with them

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:48.930 align:middle line:10%
and ask for them to
give you this dust.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And it actually does
something to you.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:54.010 align:middle line:90%
You actually feel happier.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:10%
And so a lot of
people don't realize

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:10%
that they can work
with them in that way,

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.400 align:middle line:10%
and they will sprinkle
you with this dust.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.530 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.910 align:middle line:10%
So I have these books
at home, and I highly

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:10%
recommend them for
anyone that has

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:10%
little kids and an open mind.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:11.245 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen the
Fairyopolis books?

00:30:11.245 --> 00:30:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: No.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you got to
get a Fairyopolis book.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:90%
You can find them on Amazon.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's a fully illustrated
pop-up book written by a woman,

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I think, about 100 years
ago about her experiences

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:84%
with fairies in the
garden of a friend's

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.280 align:middle line:90%
house she was staying at.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It is so beautiful and
brings everything alive.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Oh, my gosh.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just to
help with little kids,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.830 align:middle line:84%
validate them, and turn
them on to that realm.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:37.630 align:middle line:90%
It's really good.

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:90%
And for adults too.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.460 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: I
think we all just need

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to go realize that they're
real and go explore and try

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:48.280 align:middle line:84%
to have fun in nature, which
is what they really like.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:84%
They love it when we go into
nature, and we sing and dance.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So going back to
nature comes up.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter where we go.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:84%
The story always
goes back to this.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth already
has the innate knowledge

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and is making her transition
to more refined frequencies.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:09.100 align:middle line:84%
We just have to stay with
her and be joyful with her.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So these little kids that
are coming in, some of them

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.920 align:middle line:90%
would be what you said, 13?

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.662 align:middle line:90%
So up to 12 years old now.

00:31:15.662 --> 00:31:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yeah.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You say they
also have the ability

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.990 align:middle line:84%
to interact with beings
and guardian-type beings

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and such in other
dimensional realms.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes, they do.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I was working on all
this information, Merlin came.

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Merlin came through
in a session,

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and he gave me this
interesting spell

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that you can do
when you're ready,

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:41.657 align:middle line:84%
but it's a really powerful spell
to connect with the fairy realm.

00:31:41.657 --> 00:31:44.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, are you going
to share it, or you didn't know?

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: I don't know.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:50.120 align:middle line:10%
It's just when you're
ready to connect

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.800 align:middle line:10%
with it to do that
because once you do,

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.720 align:middle line:10%
you can see into
these dimensions.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Have you tried it?

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: I
haven't tried it yet.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure I'm ready.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, maybe
share it on your site

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:84%
later when you feel you're
ready and if it feels

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.010 align:middle line:90%
like other people are ready.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.670 align:middle line:84%
That'd be kind of
fun to find out.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:10.603 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Yeah, it would be.

00:32:10.603 --> 00:32:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one
of the things you

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:84%
talked about of these
children coming back,

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:84%
bringing all this knowledge
is something about anemia.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.440 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
So we each have

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:84%
clues that we bring
ourselves in order

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.980 align:middle line:84%
to help trigger deep memories,
deep ancient memories,

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of
the biggest clues.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:10%
Anemia is a clue that
perhaps you were a druid,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.720 align:middle line:10%
or you are very connected
with the fairy realm.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're even reincarnated
from the fairy realm.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Weird.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.830 align:middle line:84%
The friend I told you about
who is the deep druid who

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.480 align:middle line:84%
came with the Atlantean
knowledge back

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:90%
then has the weirdest blood.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.180 align:middle line:90%
They actually study her.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like a super immune
system that you can't crash.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: So when you
have this issue, what it is--

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:08.340 align:middle line:84%
if it is for this reason,
then it's just a clue.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Then you just tell yourself,
I am safe in this lifetime.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't need this clue.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.817 align:middle line:84%
And you can go to the
Chalice Well in Glastonbury.

00:33:16.817 --> 00:33:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's lovely there.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.942 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
There's a special mineral

00:33:19.942 --> 00:33:23.850 align:middle line:84%
they haven't studied yet in this
well that when you drink it,

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.480 align:middle line:84%
it actually does something to
help you reverse this anemia.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can work
with raw honey is

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.740 align:middle line:90%
what my clients have been told.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Just to reconnect with the
honey and then the fact

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:84%
that you possibly are
reincarnated or very connected

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to these ancient
civilizations, that

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.390 align:middle line:84%
can be enough to
reverse it for you.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:90%
But yes, we all have clues.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And I came to understand that
nothing is a coincidence.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Your eye color, the
way your freckles are,

00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.510 align:middle line:84%
your blood type, it's all a
clue for a deeper meaning.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we've talked
about the Templars a bit,

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.070 align:middle line:90%
which were male.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.820 align:middle line:84%
There were females
that supported them,

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.120 align:middle line:84%
but the Templars
themselves were male.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.458 align:middle line:84%
But you say in a lot
of these renderings

00:34:13.458 --> 00:34:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that people came back
with, the people that

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.050 align:middle line:84%
held a lot of the
sacred knowledge

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:84%
and certainly the knowledge
of healing from the very, very

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:84%
ancient times were
women and priestesses.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.810 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk a little bit
about that part of the culture

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.139 align:middle line:10%
and how it's showing itself now.

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:29.389 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Oh, my gosh.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:32.969 align:middle line:84%
So on this particular
island in the UK,

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:36.630 align:middle line:84%
which was in Scotland but
very close to Ireland--

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.659 align:middle line:84%
or I guess it would
be both in a sense--

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:90%
it was shrouded with mist.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.409 align:middle line:84%
And you had to know
how to get there,

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:45.889 align:middle line:84%
but it was completely
hidden from the public.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.960 align:middle line:10%
And they would do
these ceremonies,

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.480 align:middle line:10%
and they would store a lot
of these ancient artifacts.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.260 align:middle line:10%
And they would do ceremonies
with these crystals

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.530 align:middle line:10%
from Atlantis.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:10%
And they would use
their own bodies

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.940 align:middle line:10%
and use their
consciousness to actually

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.440 align:middle line:10%
put in different information
into the grid system

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.700 align:middle line:10%
that we can actually
still tap into,

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:10%
but that information is
resurfacing as well too.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But these women were
really profound.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:20.120 align:middle line:10%
The reason it was all women was
there is a really special effect

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.970 align:middle line:10%
that happens when you have
a group of women together

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.990 align:middle line:10%
because when women--

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:10%
when they do these sacred
ceremonies, a lot of times,

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:35.880 align:middle line:10%
they would use stuff that
was part of their own DNA.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.600 align:middle line:10%
And so they needed to
just be women to perform

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.090 align:middle line:10%
these sacred ceremonies.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And they would do
these special dances.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that the
higher self keeps talking about.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.090 align:middle line:84%
They keep saying, this is so
profound and helpful that we

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.750 align:middle line:90%
need to do these things.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.810 align:middle line:10%
But they would do
these dances where

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.640 align:middle line:10%
they would put their
bare feet on the ground,

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.540 align:middle line:10%
and they would go under the
moonlight and shake their hips.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.260 align:middle line:10%
And what that does is
it actually shakes out

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.210 align:middle line:10%
any negativity.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And they work to actually alter
the negativity of the Earth

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.190 align:middle line:90%
in this way as well.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the
ancient cultures that

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.240 align:middle line:84%
have dances where they have
their bare feet on the ground,

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and they're shaking
their hips, it's

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:25.180 align:middle line:84%
working in tandem with humanity
and with Mother Earth herself.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.573 align:middle line:84%
And so these ancient
practices need

00:36:27.573 --> 00:36:28.740 align:middle line:90%
to make a comeback because--

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.390 align:middle line:84%
African, Polynesian
from around the world--

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:84%
these practices--
in South America.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: It
helps the Earth herself.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So they would do these practices
to help the Earth shake out

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.590 align:middle line:90%
negativity.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the reasons why
people have different skin

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.160 align:middle line:84%
issues actually, the
higher self says,

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.970 align:middle line:84%
because the opening in the
skin allows for these things

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.330 align:middle line:90%
to come out.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:10%
But when you do something
like shake your hips

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.490 align:middle line:10%
and do a dance with your
bare feet on the ground,

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:01.260 align:middle line:10%
you don't need to have a skin
issue that opens and releases

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.200 align:middle line:10%
something.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So people in general
don't really know that,

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and this ancient information
is just resurfacing now.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:37:11.615 --> 00:37:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's go now back because
we have so much to get

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.010 align:middle line:90%
through and so little time.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:15.810 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: I could
talk to you all day.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:18.000 align:middle line:90%
We could.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.458 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
hit-- we're just

00:37:19.458 --> 00:37:21.220 align:middle line:84%
hitting some highlights
in your work here.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.150 align:middle line:84%
But King Arthur,
which, of course,

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.780 align:middle line:84%
that Tintagel is devoted to,
King Arthur, and the notion

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.520 align:middle line:90%
that he was in those parts.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: King
Arthur was so fascinating

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:34.650 align:middle line:84%
because the biggest
thing about him--

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.080 align:middle line:84%
well, not the
biggest thing-- was

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:40.160 align:middle line:84%
that he made sure to always
have a female perspective

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.010 align:middle line:90%
to everything.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So all his knights
of the round table

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:46.970 align:middle line:84%
would always
consult their wives,

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:90%
would always consult the female.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.440 align:middle line:10%
They always had to have
a female's perspective

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:55.460 align:middle line:10%
before anything was passed,
which made his kingdom differ

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.630 align:middle line:10%
from any other kingdom.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And it gave them an
edge because they

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:84%
would have both
the masculine ideas

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:90%
and the female perspective.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was passed without that.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And Merlin worked really
closely with King Arthur.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Merlin made an
agreement with the fairy realm

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.560 align:middle line:90%
for the Excalibur.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.180 align:middle line:90%
It was always planned.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:22.790 align:middle line:10%
But what's so interesting
about this whole kingdom

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.560 align:middle line:10%
is that it's
prophesied, apparently,

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.320 align:middle line:10%
that it's resurfacing.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:32.740 align:middle line:10%
And the resurfacing is
really this divine feminine

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:10%
mixed with fine fat masculine.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.482 align:middle line:90%
Justice, compassion.

00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yeah.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, all of that.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Always seeking
the female perspective as well

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.140 align:middle line:90%
as the masculine's perspective.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so were there
any specific prophecies

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.770 align:middle line:84%
that came through
people that they

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.830 align:middle line:84%
said would be coming
along in current times

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.010 align:middle line:90%
or in the near future?

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.927 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes.

00:38:55.927 --> 00:38:58.640 align:middle line:90%
So apparently, he's here again.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.280 align:middle line:90%
He's actually incarnated.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: King Arthur?

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:02.528 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yeah.

00:39:02.528 --> 00:39:04.838 align:middle line:84%
And all the same
players are back again.

00:39:04.838 --> 00:39:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of the
same players from Atlantis

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.090 align:middle line:90%
are back right now too.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Yes, they are.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.438 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
very interesting.

00:39:10.438 --> 00:39:12.197 align:middle line:84%
Did they have any
further comment on that,

00:39:12.197 --> 00:39:14.030 align:middle line:84%
or are they just seeded
all over the planet,

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:17.690 align:middle line:84%
or do they tend to reside
in pockets here and there?

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you
can say about it?

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Well, I believe

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:27.370 align:middle line:84%
that it's mostly the spiritual
soul DNA that's being reawakened

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and that the
information is hidden,

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.920 align:middle line:84%
but it's hidden in everybody's
subconscious memories.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.710 align:middle line:10%
And people are
starting to wake up

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.800 align:middle line:10%
and starting to get
curious about themselves

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.090 align:middle line:10%
and starting to
activate these things.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's so exciting.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:90%
It's resurfacing everywhere.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it sounds like throughout
all of these regressions

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.440 align:middle line:84%
you do that everything
keeps going back

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:90%
to Mother Earth and nature.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So wrap this all up for us
about the importance of our need

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.620 align:middle line:84%
to go back into true
relationship with Mother Earth

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and all of her beings, including
the elemental realm of which

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.900 align:middle line:90%
there are many, many species.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Well,
just for instance,

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.510 align:middle line:84%
the oracles of the
ancient times would

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.000 align:middle line:84%
take their time to
develop a relationship

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.410 align:middle line:90%
with one tree or one plant.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And we can still
do this right now.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: You develop a
relationship with that one tree.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.770 align:middle line:10%
And what the oracle
would do is they

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:32.050 align:middle line:10%
would place their bare
feet on the ground

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.170 align:middle line:10%
or have a part of
them touching the tree

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.280 align:middle line:10%
and, with their
present awareness,

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.170 align:middle line:10%
connect with that tree.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.170 align:middle line:10%
And then by doing
that, they would start

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.000 align:middle line:10%
to understand the subtleties.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.150 align:middle line:84%
They could feel how the tree
feels felt when the wind blew.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So then they could really start
to develop this relationship

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and get messages from the
tree about what was going on

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.210 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth herself.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So as we reconnect with
nature, it's just so simple.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.680 align:middle line:84%
These things are
all free and simple.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.190 align:middle line:10%
Everybody can do this.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.762 align:middle line:84%
Develop a relationship
with your tree or plant.

00:41:05.762 --> 00:41:07.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are going
to think you're weird,

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.020 align:middle line:84%
but people already think I'm
weird, so I don't care anymore.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You already
lost that battle, so.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Exactly.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I couldn't
agree more with you.

00:41:15.375 --> 00:41:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Trees, in particular, as
these incredible, not just

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.720 align:middle line:84%
knowledge-keepers but as a
conduit between the cosmos

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.980 align:middle line:84%
intelligence in
the human species.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.730 align:middle line:84%
That high canopy
up there, gathering

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:32.580 align:middle line:84%
all of that cosmic
information day and night

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:90%
and standing like sentries.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.780 align:middle line:84%
They're there for
us to connect with.

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:38.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big tree.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:39.730 align:middle line:90%
I have a tree.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:90%
I fell in love with a tree.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And a friend painted
me with the tree even.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a purple beech tree
in Kew Garden in London.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And I love this tree so much.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, I've always been a
tree hugger and a tree lover.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But they actually
will speak to you.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.870 align:middle line:84%
If you give them a chance and
sit with them long enough,

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:03.862 align:middle line:84%
you can go into
relationship with them.

00:42:03.862 --> 00:42:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Oh, my God.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:05.920 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.050 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful and--

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
love trees so much.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:10.215 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
That's what they say.

00:42:10.215 --> 00:42:11.940 align:middle line:84%
They say part of our
purpose is really

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.480 align:middle line:90%
to be stewards of the Earth.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.643 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: It
all comes down to that.

00:42:15.643 --> 00:42:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And the trees, a lot of
them have fallen asleep,

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.008 align:middle line:84%
and it's our job to
wake them back up.

00:42:21.008 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there's
some good news happening.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:25.475 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the Amazon
forest is actually

00:42:25.475 --> 00:42:27.350 align:middle line:84%
being cut at a lesser
rate, and it's starting

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.442 align:middle line:90%
to repopulate and recover.

00:42:29.442 --> 00:42:30.900 align:middle line:10%
We thought that
would never happen.

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.000 align:middle line:10%
All we ever hear is
bad news, bad news.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, it's
starting to reverse now

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.720 align:middle line:84%
through some practices, through
some politics and deals made

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.540 align:middle line:90%
here and there.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.800 align:middle line:84%
But that area is the
lungs of the planet,

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.450 align:middle line:90%
and it's starting to repopulate.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, this
is excellent news,

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.680 align:middle line:84%
to say nothing of developing
a personal relationship

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.960 align:middle line:90%
with your own trees.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.740 align:middle line:90%
So any final thoughts, Sarah?

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.070 align:middle line:84%
There's so many other topics
that we couldn't get to

00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:59.840 align:middle line:84%
in this one show,
but anything else

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:03.050 align:middle line:84%
you'd like to bring up right
now before we say goodbye?

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:10%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: I just think
it's really wonderful what

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.620 align:middle line:10%
we're doing, what you're doing.

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:12.980 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people
always ask, how can I

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.300 align:middle line:10%
look better, feel
better, and everything?

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And the way you do that is just
to master yourself, really.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And it creates this
beautiful vibration.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.160 align:middle line:84%
These women of Avalon
had this beautiful glow.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.290 align:middle line:84%
They were always so pretty
because of their glow, like you,

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:30.090 align:middle line:90%
Regina.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.350 align:middle line:10%
You remind me of them.

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:10%
You always do.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.970 align:middle line:10%
You have that glow, and that's
really what it's all about.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.040 align:middle line:10%
It's about being
stewards of the Earth,

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.880 align:middle line:10%
being as loving as
you can to everyone

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.110 align:middle line:10%
and especially yourself.

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
life around us has

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:49.130 align:middle line:84%
been designed by those who don't
have our best interests at heart

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:51.140 align:middle line:84%
to judge ourselves
and each other

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and beat ourselves up
perpetually with the stories

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:55.800 align:middle line:84%
that we don't
measure up somehow.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.967 align:middle line:10%
So no, those stories
have to go away now.

00:43:57.967 --> 00:43:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Time for them to go.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.008 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
not servicing us.

00:44:01.008 --> 00:44:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know all the people that
you're doing regressions with

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.570 align:middle line:90%
are bringing this through.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:08.480 align:middle line:90%
It's time to stop all of that.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: It is.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.850 align:middle line:84%
It's time to create new belief
systems because literally, you

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:90%
can.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And literally, just by believing
something, you make it true.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think you
were telling me off-camera

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that in the next year or two,
some really interesting stuff is

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.006 align:middle line:90%
upcoming from what you can tell.

00:44:27.006 --> 00:44:28.923 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Oh,
about the consciousness?

00:44:28.923 --> 00:44:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Oh, my gosh.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:34.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone's
going to be activated.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:37.190 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot happening.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:40.442 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I got into it, it
would take a long time, but yes.

00:44:40.442 --> 00:44:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot is
being activated.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.310 align:middle line:10%
And Christopher Bledsoe
talks about this

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:48.400 align:middle line:10%
too in his story of
the Lady that he's met

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.700 align:middle line:10%
with throughout his lifetime.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.550 align:middle line:10%
And people can go
look at that interview

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:53.750 align:middle line:10%
and see what Christopher
Bledsoe is all about.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And she was telling
him in 2026--

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Richard Rudd is saying 2026.

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:01.780 align:middle line:10%
Ra, who created human design--

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.750 align:middle line:10%
2026.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.490 align:middle line:10%
Many people are saying 2026.

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.240 align:middle line:10%
Something is going
to happen to shift

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.100 align:middle line:10%
our consciousness
on this planet,

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.980 align:middle line:10%
and we almost become
a new species.

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: We've done
this so many times before.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:18.910 align:middle line:84%
We've tried so many
times, but this

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:84%
is the time that's been foretold
about where we actually do it.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:28.400 align:middle line:84%
We have so much help, so
many people cheering for us.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we do.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:30.427 align:middle line:90%
Throughout the cosmos.

00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:32.093 align:middle line:84%
>>BRESKMAN COSME:
Throughout the cosmos.

00:45:32.093 --> 00:45:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To be this incredible
heart-centered species

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:38.148 align:middle line:84%
that has free will and didn't
blow ourselves up this time.

00:45:38.148 --> 00:45:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Not this one.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sarah,
thank you so much.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:41.920 align:middle line:90%
It's always a joy.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.282 align:middle line:84%
And we'll wait and see
what comes up next.

00:45:44.282 --> 00:45:46.240 align:middle line:84%
I guess your higher mind
will start guiding you

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.560 align:middle line:84%
to the next cluster of
regressions in whatever

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.800 align:middle line:90%
period of history that is.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I look forward to it.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BRESKMAN COSME: Me too.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Sarah has a number
of books now detailing

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:59.720 align:middle line:10%
her clients' impressions of what
was happening in past times.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.840 align:middle line:10%
Again, this isn't
definitive, but we

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.090 align:middle line:10%
need to understand
these remembrances will

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.210 align:middle line:10%
be a very meaningful
part of piecing together

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:09.920 align:middle line:10%
our distant past as
the human species.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.150 align:middle line:10%
