00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:09.900 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Now we're really

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.500 align:middle line:84%
going to go into what God looks
like through the Indigenous

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.300 align:middle line:90%
lenses.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.660 align:middle line:84%
PAUL WALLIS: It's not a story
of domination and slavery

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.950 align:middle line:90%
and colonization.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.928 align:middle line:84%
These are stories that are of
powerful beings here to assist.

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:22.470 align:middle line:84%
SEAN O'LAOIRE: In
the Gaeltic system,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:90%
light and dark are not enemies.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Dark is the fertile fecund
womb on which all life emerges.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.790 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:84%
WALLIS: There's a nonhuman
layer to the human story

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:90%
all around the planet.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: The Caol Áit is a
thin place It's a place where

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.672 align:middle line:84%
the veil between the mystic
and the mundane is diaphanous.

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.380 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I want to see
these fairy mounts.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:90%
I want to connect.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.130 align:middle line:84%
WALLIS: The ancestral stories,
the Indigenous stories

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, I
hear an invitation

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
to explore how much better a
human experience is possible.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:90%
What are we really capable of?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:10%
REGINA: In our last trialogue,
Sean O'Laoire, Paul Wallis,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:10%
and I discussed the way in which
the gods of the Old Testament

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:10%
described themselves as humans
and the events of the day.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:84%
On the whole, these gods
were a punishing lot

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.440 align:middle line:84%
that resulted in our
ancestors, and many of us

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
today, feeling
unworthy or less than.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to talk
about the gods of old.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:84%
They didn't seem to have this
effect on Earth's Indigenous

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:90%
populations.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, both of you.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
It was a fabulous
last conversation.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Now we're really
going to go into what

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.810 align:middle line:84%
God looks like
through another lens,

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.360 align:middle line:84%
through the Indigenous
lenses of the Indigenous

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:90%
people of the world.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:84%
One person said, the Africans
have no low self-esteem as poor

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:84%
as they are, living
so close to the land.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go to a story
that you'd like to share, Paul,

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
regarding Mother Teresa's
experience in London.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.810 align:middle line:90%
WALLIS: Good day.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:10%
Well, Mother Teresa came to
London in the early 1990s.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:10%
And I remember her speaking
about her experience.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:84%
She was so shocked
by what she found.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:10%
Now, Mother Teresa
had spent her life

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:10%
working in Kolkata, a very
poor part of the planet,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:10%
among the poorest of the local
people, the untouchables.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the caste
system that operates

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
in that part of the
world, the untouchables

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
are regarded as
people of no value.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:90%
You don't look at them.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:84%
You certainly don't touch
them, hence, the name.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
You would think that
people at the bottom

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
of the pile like that
would have low self-esteem.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when Mother
Teresa came to London,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
she said she was
shocked to experience

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
the collapse of self-esteem
among the teenagers of Great

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Britain.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
She said she'd never
seen anything like it.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:90%
I was blown away by that.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
How could the self-esteem of
teenagers in wealthy Great

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Britain be lower than that of
the untouchables in Kolkata?

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But I have to reflect that if
the nuclear family is broken

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:84%
down, if your extended
family is broken down,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
if your civic family
is broken down,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:90%
where do you go from there?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:84%
In the worldview
that I grew up with,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that was really shaped
by Orthodox Christianity,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, if you're on
your own, you're on your own.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
You might pray to the
almighty for help and support.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
Almighty's mysterious ways,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:90%
help might not come.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you really
are on your own.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the world view of so
many of our Indigenous peoples

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
you were never alone.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:84%
The universe is a
universe of resources.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Every human individual has
an invisible support team

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
to help them deal with
whatever is happening to them.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
always that attitude

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:84%
of looking to the universe
for help and support.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And there isn't that
feeling of I am worthless,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I have nobody's attention
that was clearly

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:84%
the affliction of
British teenagers

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:90%
that so shocked Mother Teresa.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I have to say when
I spent some time in India,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and I was surrounded
by these children

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that you're speaking of, and
they were smiling, kicking

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:84%
things around in
the street together,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
laughing, playing jokes on
each other, and so forth.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And I flew into
London from there.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And the dourness
of the children who

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
aren't allowed to
speak to strangers,

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
don't wish to speak
to strangers, just

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
this kind of sullen attitudes
of the people in general,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:90%
but the children, in particular.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:84%
I was most struck by that very
thing you just talked about,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:84%
coming back from the colorful
life in India into one that was

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:90%
much more shrouded in grey.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%
O'LAOIRE: Yeah.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.468 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: And I love London.

00:04:47.468 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:90%
WALLIS: That's very true.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: I love London.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.120 align:middle line:90%
WALLIS: Well, me too.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:90%
But you feel it as a depression.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes, very much.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
WALLIS: That low
self-esteem among the people

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:90%
comes across as a depression.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And just hurried
and not really even engaging

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:90%
with one another anywhere.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Even a simple thing
like struggling

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.310 align:middle line:84%
to get a big suitcase
up these stairs, no one

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
could be bothered to
say, can I help you?

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
It was just shocking
after India,

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.160 align:middle line:84%
where everyone was curious
and looking you in the eye

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:90%
and ready to help.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
sharing that story.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Sean.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: I had pretty
much the same experience.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I spent 14 years in Kenya.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.310 align:middle line:84%
The people are
extraordinary there.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:10%
The politicians are corrupt
like every place else.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:10%
So I actually got
kicked out of Kenya

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.005 align:middle line:10%
after 14 years for work I
was doing in social justice

00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:10%
after a few meetings with the
president at the time, Daniel

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:10%
Toroitich arap Moi.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:10%
I was dragged before a
District Security Council

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:10%
and given 48 hours to leave.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.205 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent a year in London
when I came out of Kenya.

00:05:46.205 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And I can honestly say it
was the most unhappy year

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:84%
of my life, having
come from the joy

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and the love and the support
and the laughter of Kenya

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:84%
into London with
the dour people,

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.837 align:middle line:84%
nobody making eye
contact, whatsoever.

00:05:57.837 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:90%
I stayed there for a year.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:90%
I was studying human psychology.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But it was easily the most
unhappy year of my life.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Then I came to the
States finally.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But the change from equatorial
Kenya and loving laughing

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:90%
families to London was awesome.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
The only one thing I saw
was that it's interesting,

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
if you put a camera
in front of a European

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
or an Australian or an American,
they'll break into a smile.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.810 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.643 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: They'll be
on their best behavior.

00:06:26.643 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the time,
they're dour, anxious.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.793 align:middle line:84%
You go to Africa, they're
laughing all the time.

00:06:31.793 --> 00:06:33.210 align:middle line:84%
You put a camera
in front of them,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.493 align:middle line:90%
they go, where are you from?

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
something was expected.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.058 align:middle line:84%
This is what I
expected-- formality.

00:06:38.058 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of it,
they're laughing.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's a total
180-degree shift.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Thank you, both,
for those reflections.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It seems that we've all
had the same experience

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:84%
of going from color
and life in a heartbeat

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.627 align:middle line:90%
to something so repressed.

00:06:52.627 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And it could have
been the same flying

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
into JFK or a lot
of other places

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
too, not trying to
just single out London.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So now we need to start looking
at the underpinnings of that.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And I know you, we have
stories to share from Africa.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And you, Paul, have
stories to share

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
from not only your in-laws,
but also from around the world

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
because you started chasing the
story of the gods in Indigenous

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:90%
cultures.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's start, Paul,
with some of what

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
you learned as this incredibly
common kind of backdrop story

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.230 align:middle line:84%
too in the beginning from
the Indigenous tribes.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:84%
WALLIS: Well, if you listen for
the stories of the beginning

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and the stories of the gods
for many African peoples,

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
you hear what's really a very
exciting and affirming story.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to the Edo
people or the Yoruba

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
people of Southern
Nigeria and Benin,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
you will hear their story
of first contact, which

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:84%
is of Osanobua, the almighty
one above the waters,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
descending from the heavens,
to help rehabilitate

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
our planet after there's
been a natural disaster.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And like in so-called
creation stories,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
it begins on a planet that's
devastated and flooded.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Osanobua comes from out
of the heavens on a chain,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
they say-- well, that's
obviously their technology

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
as a framework
for what they saw.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So we would think wormhole
comes down from outer space

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
to help the planet recover,
to rehabilitate the land,

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and then to work with
the people who were here,

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
to support them in
re-establishing themselves

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:90%
on the land.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So the beginning story,
the first contact story

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:90%
is of nurture.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the early leaders

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
who stayed with us,
who were these--

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
well, if I say extraterrestrial,
suddenly, it sounds scary.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:84%
But if I say Ogiso, well,
these were the leaders

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:90%
who helped us from the heavens.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And after they had governed
human society for a while,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:84%
they hand over to the
Oba, who are simply

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.280 align:middle line:84%
the leaders, the human leaders
and the kings and queens who

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:90%
follow.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is an incredibly
powerful, positive empowering

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
story, a benevolent presence,
helping us, nurturing us,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and then handing
over power to us.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not a story of domination
and slavery and colonization.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It is nurturing and helping
us and getting us going.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole
beginning of the world

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:84%
as we know it, according
to those African stories.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And then you can go to Nigeria.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear the Efik
story of Abbasi and Atai,

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
who, again, nurtured
humanity and built us up

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
until we were a civilization
on planet Earth.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
You listen to the
Zulu story and you've

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
got this mysterious entity,
female entity, Mbaba Mwana

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Waresa, who arrives and upgrades
us to the point where we now

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:90%
have agriculture.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So we can now build
towns and cities

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:90%
and become a civilization.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So these are stories
running through history

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:84%
that are of powerful
beings here to assist.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So those are the gods
in those stories.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
stories I mentioned before.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned the mummy water
stories from out of Ghana--

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:84%
WALLIS: --of this other
presence of advanced beings

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:84%
who are here because
they want some of what

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.410 align:middle line:90%
we have in their gene pool.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.900 align:middle line:90%
They think we're fabulous.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But there is an
arrangement in which

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:90%
they help us and we help them.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not one of these
shock horror $50

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.860 align:middle line:84%
from the "National
Enquirer" stories.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a profound experience
that goes all around the world.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's this mutual arrangement
that's being described.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Now I might say, people
who experience that, still

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
might have a problem explaining
that to their relatives

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.900 align:middle line:84%
when they get back from an
experience of abduction.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's the context
that the African peoples

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:90%
have for those stories.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And then it flows on into
what we were talking about

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:84%
in our first
session, where there

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:84%
are Indigenous stories
of spirits who assist

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:90%
each one of us in the present.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And very often, the
shamanic healers

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:84%
are a little bit vague about
who or what these spirits are,

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:84%
other than they're here
to help and support us.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you
remain a [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.580 align:middle line:84%
as long as you remain sovereign,
you keep your personal

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:84%
autonomy, you can expect to
be getting good information.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you
believe everything

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.250 align:middle line:84%
that comes into your mind or
everything a spirit tells you,

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:90%
you're in charge of yourself.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And you weigh it up
and you take the advice

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:42.710 align:middle line:90%
you think is helpful.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:84%
You take the action that
you feel is positive.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you put all that together
from the very beginning right

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:90%
to you and me.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:84%
The picture is that we swim
in a sea of company that

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
is there to affirm and
support and help us.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And now you have your
version, not just in Africa.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I want you to share
your version, Sean,

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:84%
of the helpers,
the others, Irish,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:90%
in terms of Irish legend.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:90%
O'LAOIRE: Great.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So in Irish mythology,
there's this crossover point

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:84%
between what we call the Tuatha
De Danann, which literally

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:84%
means the people of the
goddess Danu on the one hand

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and what we call the
Milesians, better known

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:90%
as the Celts on the other hand.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere around 600 BC in
that time period allegedly,

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:84%
the Celts and the
Milesians visited Ireland.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And there were two great
battles in the same location,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:90%
a place called Moyturey.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Celts defeated
the Tuatha De Danann

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.630 align:middle line:90%
in both battles.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So there was an arrangement
made between the two,

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:84%
that they would divide the
land of Ireland into two.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.683 align:middle line:84%
And that the Celts,
there was the one

00:12:48.683 --> 00:12:50.600 align:middle line:84%
who get the North and
the other got the South,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and one got the East and
the other got the West.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Their agreement was that
the Celts would get Ireland,

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
above the ground, and that
Tuatha De Danann would

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:84%
inherit Ireland under the
ground and under the oceans.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:90%
So that was the agreement.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the Tuatha
De Danann shape

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
shifted and became
known as the fairy folk.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And they live underground
and under water.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a lot
of stories about--

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
there's a famous Irish place in
Irish mythology called Tír fo

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Thuinn, which literally means
the land under the waves.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a place
called Tír na nÓg,

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.800 align:middle line:84%
which means the land
of the ever young.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the Tuatha De Danann were
long-lived-- very long-lived--

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:90%
much more so than the humans.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
interface between that

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:84%
goes on right up to the time
I was a child in Ireland.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
All these stories of
commingling between them that I

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:90%
heard from my grandfather.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at
it you have the goddesses

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
in that storytelling are
the archetypes of nature,

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and the gods are the
archetypes of culture.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And in the Celtic
Tuatha De Danann system,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
nature and nurture
are dance partners.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.070 align:middle line:84%
They're not enemies
of each other,

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:84%
like they are in the
West very, very often.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:90%
So they dance.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:90%
So they're archetypes.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
a ceremony that when

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:84%
the high king of Ireland
was being installed,

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.660 align:middle line:90%
he had to marry the land.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And if he proved to
be a good husband,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:90%
the land would be fertile.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.110 align:middle line:84%
If he proved to
be a poor husband,

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:90%
there'd be famine times.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
constant dance that

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:84%
goes on between the goddesses,
representing nature,

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and the gods
representing culture.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And you get that indicated the
dance between light and dark.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, in the Celtic system,
light and dark are not enemies.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Dark is not evil.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Dark is the fertile fecund
womb on which all life emerges.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: And so it's
just like the Hebrews,

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:84%
the Celts began their
day in the evening.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:84%
When the sun went down, that
was the beginning of the next 24

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:90%
hour cycle of day.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: A gestation period.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.120 align:middle line:90%
O'LAOIRE: Exactly.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:90%
The same with the year.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Samhain on the 31st of
October was the beginning

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:84%
of the dark time of the year and
the Beltane on the 1st of May

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:90%
was the beginning of the light.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle line:90%
But one was birthing the other.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.600 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that the light
was being suppressed

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:84%
by the darkness, but that
the darkness was giving birth

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:90%
to the light.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And that in some senses were
like the sperm and the egg

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:90%
version.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So again and again and
again in Irish mythology,

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
you get this interface
between them.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And as Paul was
mentioning, both sides

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.303 align:middle line:84%
needed to kind of
upgrade their stock.

00:15:19.303 --> 00:15:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So you have this notion of
what's called in Ireland,

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:90%
the Shiofra.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And the Shiofra is a
changeling, where occasionally,

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:84%
human babies would be stolen
and replaced with look-alikes.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes, human beings
would abduct selkies.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Selkies were a kind
of seal people,

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.639 align:middle line:84%
are half-fish,
half-human people,

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:41.847 align:middle line:90%
mermaids, merman, whatsoever.

00:15:41.847 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mermaids, yes.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.270 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: And sometimes,
they came onshore

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.835 align:middle line:84%
and they discarded
their spacesuits.

00:15:47.835 --> 00:15:49.460 align:middle line:84%
There's this great
story, for instance,

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:84%
my grandfather
told me about a guy

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.267 align:middle line:90%
they called Thady Rua O'Dowd.

00:15:54.267 --> 00:15:55.850 align:middle line:84%
"Rua" in Ireland
just means redheaded.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:90%
So a redheaded Thady O'Dowd.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And he's walking
along the beach.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:84%
He's just been made
the chief of his clan.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle line:90%
So he has to get married.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
You can't be a chief if
you cannot be married.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So he's finding it
difficult to find

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:90%
a wife that he wants to marry.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.242 align:middle line:84%
And he's walking around
the beach thinking,

00:16:10.242 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and he sees this mermaid
who has come ashore,

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:90%
and she discarded her tail.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And she's combing
her long tresses.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So he grabs the suit
and he hides it.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And now she can't get
back into the ocean.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.600 align:middle line:90%
So they fall in love.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:84%
They get married
and have seven kids.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But if she ever finds her tail,
she'd go back to the ocean.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And one day, one of her
kids is messing around

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:90%
and he finds the tail.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Look, mommy, look what I found.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So mommy goes down to the
ocean, puts the tail on,

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:90%
she has seven kids.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.710 align:middle line:84%
She can't take the
seven with her.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.600 align:middle line:84%
She turns five of
them into rocks--

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:84%
very famous rocks
in the Irish coast--

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:84%
grabs two more under her arms
and goes back into the sea.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So you have abduction
happening on both sides.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.805 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: And
you've got the need

00:16:51.805 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
to kind of upgrade the
species by not being stuck

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:90%
in a small little gene pool.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So you get sea of roses when
the fairies abducted human baby

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and replaced it
with a lookalike.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And the selkies were
returning the favor

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:84%
by stealing mermaids and
marrying them on land.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.349 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Fascinating.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And these are stories that
exist in other cultures

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:90%
too, even in modern ufology.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
They talk about unidentified
submerged cultures,

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:90%
bases, people.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:90%
They come out of the sea.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And as Paul, you
told me, oftentimes,

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
these abductions
that you became aware

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
of happen along the coast
lines, where something

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.470 align:middle line:90%
has come from the sea, right?

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.820 align:middle line:90%
WALLIS: Yes, that's right.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, other large
bodies of water as well.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
If you go to South
America, you'll

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.660 align:middle line:84%
hear that version
of water whales,

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.925 align:middle line:90%
you'll hear that version.

00:17:40.925 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah,
that's fascinating.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
WALLIS: All the same
elements are there.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:45.607 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It is, all
over the world.

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And here, today, we're
left with something

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
that we call fairy
mounds, which--

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm headed to Ireland soon.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to see
these fairy mounds.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to connect
with these beings.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you say,
these were the ones

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:84%
that had won the battle
for the underground

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and still exist today.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:90%
And we call the wee folk, right?

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's a wide
variety of entities

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
that are in a slightly
different dimension, right?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:90%
O'LAOIRE: Multi life forms.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Multi life forms.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:10.830 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: It's kind
of a catchall phrase

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:90%
for that which is not human.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: For a not human.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, so from this, this
is very much still

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:90%
part of the Irish culture.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
mind, both of you,

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:90%
you told me about a lovely song.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what it's called--

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Shortcut--

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: Shortcut
to the Rosses.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: --to the Rosses.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:90%
O'LAOIRE: So the story is this.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.908 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The
Shortcut to the Rosses."

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:10%
Rosses is an Irish term for
a wood, a wood or a forest.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And this a story of a man taking
a shortcut through the woods.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And the danger in
going in woodland--

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:90%
a wood is a thin place.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
In Gaelic, we have this
phrase called the Caol Áit.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And the Caol Áit
is a thin place.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where the
veil between the mystic

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and the mundane is diaphanous
between the secular

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and the sacred.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And so a certain spots, woods,
mountaintops, lakes, as Paul

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:90%
just mentioned, the sea is.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And so being in
these places, you

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.990 align:middle line:84%
have to be really,
really careful.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.375 align:middle line:84%
And there's this guy going
through, taking a shortcut,

00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and he's going through
a woodland area.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And he meets this
beautiful looking woman

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:84%
with these long,
long, shiny tresses,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:90%
and falls in love with her.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.530 align:middle line:90%
And so they come together.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And then he discovers
after they have

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:84%
parted that she's literally
taken her heart away from him.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And now he's really,
really afraid.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And the last verse
of it says, simply--

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) By the short
cut to the rosses,

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:90%
'tis I'll go and never more.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Lest she should also steal my
soul who stole my heart before.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Lest she steal my
soul and crush it

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:90%
like a dead leaf in her hand.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:84%
For the shortcut to the rosses
is the way to fairyland.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.497 align:middle line:84%
So having lost his
heart to her, he's

00:19:48.497 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:84%
afraid he's going to lose
his soul to her as well.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So he's not going to
go back there anymore.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.052 align:middle line:84%
So there were some
songs which are actually

00:19:54.052 --> 00:19:55.460 align:middle line:90%
banned by the church.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.085 align:middle line:84%
There was another
one, a beautiful one,

00:19:57.085 --> 00:19:58.970 align:middle line:84%
called Cailin Deas
Crúite na mBó,

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.045 align:middle line:84%
which means the
beautiful young milkmaid,

00:20:02.045 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:90%
a woman who milks the cows.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And the story is that there
was a priest on a sick call,

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:84%
very, very late, one night,
that a parishioner is dying

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.242 align:middle line:84%
and he has to rush
to attend them.

00:20:12.242 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, he's taking a
shortcut through the forest.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And hears this
extraordinary fairy music.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And he stops for a
moment to listen to it,

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:90%
and then moves on.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And he gets to the house
and the man has died.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And he realizes there's
been missing time.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
He's been in the forest
for five or six hours.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:90%
So he cursed the song.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And so literally, when I
was a child in Ireland,

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
there was no permission to play
that song on national radio.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Cailin Deas Crúite na mBó.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So this is still
taken very seriously.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: This was in the
1950s when I was a small kid.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.290 align:middle line:84%
That song could not be played
on what was called RTE, radio,

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:90%
television, the Irish radio.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The church had banned it
because of what it did.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be really,
really careful of fairy music

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.503 align:middle line:84%
that they could intervene
at inopportune moments.

00:20:58.503 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And somebody's
immortal soul could

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.888 align:middle line:90%
be compromised in the process.

00:21:01.888 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Thank you for that
interesting, beautiful song.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
singing for us.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Now Paul, we're
looking at-- when

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:84%
we were talking earlier
about how these beings came

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:84%
to help establish culture
and such in a dire time

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:84%
after an inundation, for
example, in these stories

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.620 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world,
Freddy Silva writes

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:84%
about these beings
as the shining ones,

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:84%
including those from Australia
and also in New Zealand,

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:90%
and all over the world.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back to Africa now
because that's the story of you

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:90%
say great excitement and hope.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.160 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
your family and friends.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking about
classic abduction,

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and how her family-- how she,
her family, and the Indigenous

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.780 align:middle line:84%
people feel about what
we know today refer to,

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:84%
in John Mack's style,
as classic abduction.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:90%
WALLIS: Yes.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:10%
I think when we use
the word abduction,

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:10%
we naturally think
someone is taken by force.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And you might never
see them again.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:84%
The experience of abductions
referenced in the Mami Wata

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:84%
stories, and this is a family
of stories that's global--

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
it's just Ghana where I first
heard it, is different to that

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
because people meet these
other beings often on the beach

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:90%
or near a body of water.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.030 align:middle line:90%
And these other beings are hot.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:84%
They're drop dead
gorgeous people--

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.790 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.910 align:middle line:84%
WALLIS: --who then persuade
the person to go with them.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Then take them by
force, persuade

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:84%
them to go with
promises of advancement,

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
higher intelligence,
strengthened health.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.230 align:middle line:84%
They'll come back, they'll
be more prosperous,

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
a wonderful time,

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see things
that are unimaginable.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.510 align:middle line:90%
All these promises are made.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And so the person goes, and
then is gone for several years.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So the family we know, this
happened to a girl in Anloga,

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:84%
in the Keta district of
the Volta region of Ghana.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:84%
She was missing for three
years, no communication

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:90%
with the family.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:84%
When she returned,
it took a long time

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.040 align:middle line:84%
before she was willing to tell
her family the story of where

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:90%
she'd been.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.750 align:middle line:84%
They had assumed
she's been kidnapped,

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:90%
she's been trafficked.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was a failed elopement
we knew nothing about.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.020 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't the story.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Finally, she opened
up to her mom.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And she said, the
reason I couldn't

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.910 align:middle line:84%
contact you is because I was
held in an underwater base.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:10%
There was no way I
could contact you.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:90%
I was used for hybridization.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:84%
They made me have children
while I was there.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the final piece
of information-- the people

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:90%
who held me were not human.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.910 align:middle line:90%
They were Mami Wata.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And so every element
of that story

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:84%
repeats around the world,
where people are enticed,

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.350 align:middle line:84%
taken with promises
of advancement.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.390 align:middle line:84%
They're used to hybridisation,
and then they're

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:84%
returned often healthier
than when they went away.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:84%
It's still a very difficult
story to return with.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:84%
You come home with
that story is not

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.750 align:middle line:84%
going to help you win
favor with your family

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.480 align:middle line:84%
or get you a better job
or anything like that.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
If you tell that story,
coming back to Kenya,

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:84%
for instance, where they have
a long tradition of this,

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:84%
the Maharani
tradition, you're still

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.727 align:middle line:84%
more likely to be
medicated than promoted--

00:24:26.727 --> 00:24:27.685 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Or hospitalized

00:24:27.685 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:84%
WALLIS: --if you come
after that story.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Or hospitalized.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And one of the hardest
to process aspects

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.590 align:middle line:84%
of the story for
the relatives is

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:84%
when the people who were
taken, say, actually,

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:90%
these other people are nice.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.740 align:middle line:90%
I actually quite like them.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.200 align:middle line:84%
It grieved me I
couldn't contact you,

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.660 align:middle line:90%
but they treated me very kindly.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear that story
in Africa, the Caribbean,

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:84%
the Philippines, India,
Wales, the whole of Europe

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:57.310 align:middle line:84%
is named after a woman
who had this experience

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:02.740 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Europa taken by
Zeus and had three children.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
Minos, the Minoan culture,

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.470 align:middle line:90%
named after him.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:09.490 align:middle line:84%
This is all taught
as history in Europe.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not told as fable.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And what I find
exciting is that there

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:84%
are parts of the world where
the story has been maintained,

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:22.100 align:middle line:84%
has survived the attempted
silencing of the story.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And in some parts of
the world, the story

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%
has been recovered and
revived by people who've

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.460 align:middle line:84%
gone and listen to
the locals and said,

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:84%
we need to write this
down so that this will not

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:90%
be forgotten.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's the story
of the Popol Vuh.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the story of Robert
Kirk in Scotland, who

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
heard the fae stories that Sean
was just describing and said,

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:90%
we need to write this down.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was a very conservative
Presbyterian minister

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:84%
in the 1600s, but he listened
to the locals with respect,

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and believed what
they were telling him

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.810 align:middle line:84%
that there's a nonhuman
layer to the human story

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.650 align:middle line:90%
all around the planet.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And Sean, I want you to comment
on from that, but I wanted--

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.805 align:middle line:90%
can I tell a teensy story?

00:26:05.805 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:90%
O'LAOIRE: Sure.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.630 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So my father
is in Ireland.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So he's in a little village, and
they're staying at a B and B.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's asking what these
big mountains are out there.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling oh,
you stay away from there.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, why?

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, let me
tell you a story.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the person that
had the B and B said,

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:90%
there was a man who came here.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:84%
He thought he could
work that land.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.270 align:middle line:90%
He came with the tractor.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
You probably know
what I'm going to say.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And so he started
circling around the mound

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:90%
with the tractor.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.272 align:middle line:84%
And before you knew it, it had
turned over and flipped on him

00:26:33.272 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:90%
and killed him.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, you don't
go on the land.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening with
that land still to this day?

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And then please, comment
on what Paul said.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: And so
for one thing, as I

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:84%
say, they went underground,
the fairy folk,

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:90%
the Tuatha De Danann.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
missing time stories

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.200 align:middle line:90%
that my grandfather told me--

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes,

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.878 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: My grandfather
was born about 3 miles

00:26:52.878 --> 00:26:55.153 align:middle line:84%
from Blarney Castle, the
famous Blarney Castle.

00:26:55.153 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Down in County Cork.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.362 align:middle line:90%
O'LAOIRE: In County Cork.

00:26:57.362 --> 00:27:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
famous fairy folks there.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And he's living 3 or 4 miles
outside the little town

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:90%
with his parents.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:90%
He's about seven years of age.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.882 align:middle line:84%
And his mother, one
evening, sent him

00:27:07.882 --> 00:27:11.560 align:middle line:84%
down to the local shop, which
is like a 2 and 1/2 mile journey

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:84%
to get a pound of
sugar for the tea.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So he's wondering off, a
seven-year-old boy, goes out

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:84%
to the shop, gets the pound
of sugar, he's coming back up,

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and he hears music
coming from the mound.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:90%
And he's fascinated.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.160 align:middle line:84%
He grew up to be a
great musician himself.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And he's hearing
this music and he

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:84%
starts going,
following the sounds,

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and he sees this
slight little opening.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And he crawls
towards as a child.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's this huge
big amphitheater inside.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And all the fairies are
playing and dancing--

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:90%
playing the fiddle or whatever.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.698 align:middle line:84%
And he's fascinated
by the music.

00:27:39.698 --> 00:27:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
one of them spots him.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:42.640 align:middle line:90%
He says, come in, child.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And they bring him in.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Can you play music?

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.665 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I can
play the fiddle.

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So they gave him a fiddle,
he's playing the fiddle.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.080 align:middle line:90%
So he's there for a few hours.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, they say,
have a cup of tea with us,

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:54.700 align:middle line:84%
for we're having
a break for tea.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.487 align:middle line:84%
And then they discover
they have no sugar.

00:27:57.487 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Damn it, we have no sugar.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.278 align:middle line:84%
Can't drink tea without
sugar in Ireland.

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:02.028 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I have a
pound of sugar here.

00:28:02.028 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
My mother just sent
me to the shop.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So he shared the
sugar with them.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.055 align:middle line:84%
So finally, they say
good night to him,

00:28:08.055 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:90%
and they lead him back out.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.847 align:middle line:84%
He comes back out, and the whole
village is out looking for him.

00:28:11.847 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:84%
There's this big, big policeman
and his mother was in tears.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.020 align:middle line:90%
And she was afraid.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.125 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:19.000 align:middle line:84%
He thought he was away
for about three hours,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and he's been missing
for a week or so.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you should go
to the one in Blarney.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.753 align:middle line:84%
But to pick up with
what Paul was saying.

00:28:26.753 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting you talk
about the shining one's part

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:33.070 align:middle line:84%
because the Kalenjin people
have many names for God.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:36.100 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
kind of a sun god.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So Asis is one name
they have for God.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.332 align:middle line:84%
And the name for
the sun is Asista.

00:28:41.332 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when you leave, when
you get up in the morning

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and you leave your home,
the first thing you do

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:84%
is you spit in your two hands
and you offer it to the sun,

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and you said Ye Ngai
Asista, raising the sun.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Because if you live in
the desert and you--

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:84%
if you've got spittle in
your mouth, you're healthy.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So the spit in both and
thank you for the spittle

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:90%
because it means I'm healthy.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.470 align:middle line:90%
So Asis is one name.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.020 align:middle line:84%
The second name was
called [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:84%
which literally means
the nine-legged one.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.545 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from when you see
the sun setting in the evening,

00:29:11.545 --> 00:29:13.670 align:middle line:84%
coming through clouds and
there are shafts of light

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:14.900 align:middle line:90%
that come down to Earth.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that
there were nine shafts.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And there literally were
a sky being-- a light

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.410 align:middle line:90%
being walking upon the Earth.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way in which
it interfaced with the planet.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But the one name that they chose
when the Christian missionaries

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.650 align:middle line:84%
came in, and they decided
to pick a name for God.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And the only name you
find in the Kalenjin Bible

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:90%
is God is called Cheptolil.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And Chepto means a
maiden, and Lil means

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.710 align:middle line:90%
wise or bright or shining.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's the name they chose.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Bible, in
the Kalenjin Bible, when

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:51.627 align:middle line:84%
you and meet upon God, it's
Cheptolil, the shining maiden.

00:29:51.627 --> 00:29:52.460 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Interesting.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: There was the
Kalenjin version of it.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that
does often happen,

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:84%
it seems, with people
who have been away,

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.290 align:middle line:84%
people who've been abducted
as we call it in common terms

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.230 align:middle line:84%
today, is that when
they return, they often

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:08.600 align:middle line:84%
have increased abilities
or gifts that they

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:90%
didn't have before they left.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to comment
first on that, Paul?

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.690 align:middle line:90%
WALLIS: Yes.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that firsthand
from many people who've

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:22.220 align:middle line:84%
had close encounter
experiences, it's

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:26.810 align:middle line:84%
part of a wider syndrome known
as acquired savant syndrome.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And the part that's more
commonly acknowledged

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.920 align:middle line:84%
is the pattern of a
person having a brain

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.070 align:middle line:90%
event, a stroke, a coma.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
emerge from that,

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.390 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, they're having
precognitive dreams

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.465 align:middle line:84%
or telepathic
connection, or they

00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:84%
could play an instrument
they couldn't play before,

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:47.757 align:middle line:84%
language they couldn't speak
before they're suddenly

00:30:47.757 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:90%
fluent in.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
studied by a series

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:84%
of peer-reviewed scientists
all around the world.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:84%
What's less frequently
acknowledged

00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:84%
is that, that upgrade can often
happen after a close encounter

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:01.980 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I've met a
number of people

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.060 align:middle line:84%
who've had that experience,
personally, in the present.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's a
continuation of ancient story

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that says that our
contact in the deep past

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:17.467 align:middle line:90%
was to support and upgrade us.

00:31:17.467 --> 00:31:19.800 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: Yes, I mean, when
you trawl through the Bible,

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.010 align:middle line:84%
as Paul has done so beautifully
in his books, that's

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:84%
what was happening again
and again and again.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.600 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: All the
prophetic figures,

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:84%
all the charismatic
individuals, any kind

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:90%
of an intervention from beyond.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Now it's just a
personal story here,

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and I only remembered
this, Paul,

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.168 align:middle line:84%
whenever it came to the last
chapter of your third book,

00:31:35.168 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:84%
about this friend of yours
who was struck by lightning.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.665 align:middle line:90%
I had a similar event happen--

00:31:38.665 --> 00:31:38.890 align:middle line:90%
WALLIS: Yes, Taryn.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:39.920 align:middle line:90%
O'LAOIRE: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I was living for seven of
the years I lived in Kenya,

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I was in a little mission
called Kipchimchim.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was about 5
miles from a big town

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.380 align:middle line:84%
called Kericho, which was
the center of the tea growing

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:90%
district of Kenya.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And Kericho was about 40
miles from the biggest lake

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:90%
in Africa.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.860 align:middle line:84%
It's called Lake Kisumu,
just we call Lake Victoria.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So every evening,
between 2:00 and 4:00,

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.500 align:middle line:84%
we got these horrendous
lightning storms, literally,

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.730 align:middle line:90%
every evening.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, with
dire consequences.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a family close
to me was wiped out

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:15.560 align:middle line:84%
in such an event, a
mother and five kids.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.902 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sitting in
my office one day,

00:32:17.902 --> 00:32:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and I have a telephone
line because there

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:90%
was a big compound.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:90%
We had a mission.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.860 align:middle line:90%
We had African sisters.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.200 align:middle line:84%
We had a maternity
hospital, a primary school,

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.390 align:middle line:84%
a secondary school, and
a hostel for physically

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.290 align:middle line:84%
disabled children,
polio victims.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:90%
So I got a telephone.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting in my
office and I'm writing,

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and I've got my elbow
on top of the phone.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And the phone has a wire
coming in from outside,

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.878 align:middle line:84%
and it's stapled to the
wall, every 6 inches,

00:32:41.878 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:90%
it's stapled to the wall.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big box
with the battery inside.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the lightning

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:48.650 align:middle line:84%
struck the line
right outside me.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever
heard lightning,

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.060 align:middle line:90%
it's like crashing glass.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.103 align:middle line:84%
It hit the wire right outside,
the wire came off the wall,

00:32:56.103 --> 00:32:57.770 align:middle line:84%
the staples are flying
across the room--

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:90%
--like a machine gun.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:84%
The box exploded and
the battery exploded,

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.518 align:middle line:90%
and I fired across the room.

00:33:05.518 --> 00:33:06.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm laying in the corner.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea whether it
was 10 seconds, 10 minutes,

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:09.710 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I come to-- and my entire arm,
from my shoulder to my finger,

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.730 align:middle line:84%
there's a blue
aura about 2 inches

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:19.998 align:middle line:84%
around each side, my entire
arm and it's paralyzed.

00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I can't move for about an hour.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And then slowly by
slowly, I came back in.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And after I read your
book, I suddenly realized,

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:30.500 align:middle line:90%
that was in early 1979.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.390 align:middle line:84%
By mid-1979, I started having
these really extraordinary

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:35.190 align:middle line:90%
visions.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.913 align:middle line:84%
And I recorded a
whole bunch of them.

00:33:36.913 --> 00:33:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't put it together
until I read your book,

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.920 align:middle line:84%
realizing why did it suddenly
start in the middle of 1979

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.285 align:middle line:84%
that I started writing
these visionary experiences,

00:33:45.285 --> 00:33:46.910 align:middle line:84%
having these visionary
experiences that

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:90%
continue to this day.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.920 align:middle line:90%
I was struck by lightning.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.435 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: And you wrote these--

00:33:53.435 --> 00:33:55.730 align:middle line:84%
you recorded your
visions, which were

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:84%
beautiful Christian
mystical visions

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:84%
that you had regarding Jesus,
regarding Mary Magdalene.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you wrote your
book, "Setting God Free,"

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.820 align:middle line:84%
you had a chapter questioning
what Jesus might be,

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.260 align:middle line:90%
who he may have been.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.469 align:middle line:84%
The editors felt it might
be better to eliminate it

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:17.750 align:middle line:84%
because the book was just
a bit too heavy, right?

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:18.929 align:middle line:90%
So they eliminated that.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.679 align:middle line:84%
So I've read that chapter
and I've read your vision.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.130 align:middle line:90%
So let's go there.

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:27.419 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what you
think Jesus's prime entity he

00:34:27.419 --> 00:34:28.219 align:middle line:90%
might be.

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:28.980 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: I go over
to Paul, instead.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.719 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:31.094 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: It's
interesting once I

00:34:31.094 --> 00:34:33.820 align:middle line:84%
came across the workings
of Zecharia Sitchin,

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.480 align:middle line:84%
that Paul knows very,
very, very well.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I began to think about all
of the other characters

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:41.659 align:middle line:84%
in the scriptures who have
kind of spectacular births.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Like as you mentioned, John
the Baptist, the Old Testament.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Many, many different
characters to childless mothers

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.500 align:middle line:84%
or menopausal,
post-menopausal women.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.159 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly realized if Jesus
didn't have an earthly father,

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.620 align:middle line:84%
it meant that he's
part extraterrestrial.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.990 align:middle line:90%
So I'm thinking, he's a hybrid.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:84%
There's Mary, his
mother, but his father

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.120 align:middle line:90%
is an off planet being.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.620 align:middle line:90%
So I give this homily--

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.500 align:middle line:84%
this is way back in
2009, in the church

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.630 align:middle line:84%
that I think there's
evidence to support

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.225 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus was a hybrid.

00:35:14.225 --> 00:35:15.627 align:middle line:90%
And there's Pandemonium.

00:35:15.627 --> 00:35:17.710 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I was going to say
it didn't go down well.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.502 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: When you
started doing your state

00:35:19.502 --> 00:35:21.340 align:middle line:84%
plan for your
congregation, I thought

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.720 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus was a hybrid.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does it mean?

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.705 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have any
earthly father, allegedly,

00:35:25.705 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:84%
so his father wasn't
terrestrial, which

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:90%
means he was extraterrestrial.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.130 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.050 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: How are you
going to unpack that.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.820 align:middle line:84%
His father was not
a terrestrial being.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.785 align:middle line:84%
So means, he was a
hybrid of some kind.

00:35:35.785 --> 00:35:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's evidence
for that happening again

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.785 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:35:38.785 --> 00:35:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, in the
mythology of the world,

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.490 align:middle line:84%
you'll find it all
over the place, even

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:84%
people like Alexander the Great,
that his mother was impregnated

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:51.068 align:middle line:84%
by Marduk, pretending to be
Philip, the wife of his mother.

00:35:51.068 --> 00:35:52.360 align:middle line:90%
So it goes right through Earth.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.530 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You're not
getting birthday cards

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:84%
from the Catholic
Church anymore.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.720 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say
this is something

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.760 align:middle line:84%
a personal experience,
and then go to you, Paul.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.410 align:middle line:84%
You just mentioned
John the Baptist.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.570 align:middle line:90%
And you had written about--

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:08.860 align:middle line:84%
because I had read "Scars of
Eden" and "Echoes of Eden."

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Is that in "Echoes
of Eden" then,

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.860 align:middle line:84%
where I read about
the same thing

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
you were just talking about,
about these virgin births,

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Paul?

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Just refresh me on which
book I was reading.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.040 align:middle line:84%
WALLIS: I think it's
"Scars of Eden."

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.640 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: "Scars of Eden."

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, that was "Scars of Eden."

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:20.670 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So when you're writing
about John the Baptist,

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:90%
I started flashing back.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I went to Jerusalem
and Karem, went up

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.310 align:middle line:84%
to the monastery
that exists there

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:84%
today, that is surrounding
a baptismal well,

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:36.100 align:middle line:84%
which the people, they're
protecting that well.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And that monastery say that
was John the Baptist's well,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.210 align:middle line:84%
up in the kind of rugged
area outside of Ankaram.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:44.865 align:middle line:90%
So I went into the little--

00:36:44.865 --> 00:36:46.990 align:middle line:84%
what they don't talk about
when people visit there,

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:49.570 align:middle line:90%
there's a cave above the well.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I went up above the
well, into the cave,

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and it turned out-- this was
like the day before Christmas.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.210 align:middle line:90%
There was not one person there.

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I almost felt like
it was a miracle.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.010 align:middle line:90%
So I had the cave all to myself.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:01.390 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, I love caves.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:07.540 align:middle line:84%
All of these pantheon of beings,
in this case, Egyptian beings,

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.370 align:middle line:90%
showed up in that cave with me.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I was at
a surprise birthday party.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.910 align:middle line:90%
I was not expecting that.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're downloading
the meaning of

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.385 align:middle line:90%
and hieroglyphics into my aura.

00:37:20.385 --> 00:37:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Even though it
was going so fast,

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what was going on.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And this beautiful
radiant being comes down.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I was just overwhelmed
by the whole thing.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Later on called
a friend of mine,

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.940 align:middle line:84%
who I did a lot of
meditation with, and I said--

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:84%
because she showed
up too in the cave.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.235 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, I didn't
answer my phone earlier.

00:37:39.235 --> 00:37:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I was in the middle of
this crazy experience.

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:43.250 align:middle line:84%
She said, yes, I
was having a dream.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I was somewhere very
strange with you.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway,
that continued on.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.375 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
most profound experiences

00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:90%
to this day for me.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.940 align:middle line:84%
But again, this was bringing in
these other beings, these God

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:01.720 align:middle line:84%
creatures in this case
from Egyptian mythology

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.170 align:middle line:90%
or well, reality.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So there we go
with some ETs again

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.450 align:middle line:84%
around John the Baptist, who was
known for quite some visions,

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:09.250 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's go to
the other version

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.780 align:middle line:84%
of what Sean was talking about
a moment ago because you've

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.160 align:middle line:90%
had your own experiences.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.910 align:middle line:84%
WALLIS: Well, I'm absolutely
with what Sean was just saying.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
anomalous births

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:25.000 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, for instance,
Jesus, John the Baptist, Isaac.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.460 align:middle line:84%
They all follow close encounters
with non-human entities.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.260 align:middle line:84%
That's our language
for it today.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.920 align:middle line:84%
In the past, we would tell it
as stories of the supernatural

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.910 align:middle line:90%
or of magic.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Now we have other language.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.780 align:middle line:90%
We have artificial insemination.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.460 align:middle line:90%
We have IVF.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.000 align:middle line:90%
We have surgery in utero.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.380 align:middle line:84%
We've got other language
for these things.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is the church
has often told the story

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:55.600 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus' birth as if it's a
unique story, but it isn't.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the same as his
cousin's story, for a start.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Both mothers, they're not going
to have children, naturally.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Mary, we're told, is a virgin.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, we're told,
is post menopause.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.300 align:middle line:90%
They have close encounters.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They have very
significant babies--

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:17.800 align:middle line:84%
people who are highly
intelligent, highly conscious.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.660 align:middle line:84%
We've got a story,
which I believe

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:25.240 align:middle line:84%
is a story of human origins
with Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Sarah is post menopause.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:28.270 align:middle line:90%
She's not going to have a baby.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.450 align:middle line:84%
They have a close encounter
with three sky people,

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.190 align:middle line:90%
and then they have Isaac.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that is
our familiar version

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:39.700 align:middle line:84%
of the story of
Brahma and Saraswati,

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.740 align:middle line:84%
who are the
progenitors of humanity

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.130 align:middle line:90%
in the Vedic tradition.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is how significant
a story that is.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And then it's not
unique to the Bible.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:52.080 align:middle line:84%
The Yellow Emperor, the
mother of the Yellow Emperor.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Lao Tzu, according
to legend, his mother

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:90%
had the same experience.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.220 align:middle line:84%
The Vipassi Buddha,
the 22nd incarnation

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.990 align:middle line:84%
of Buddha before
Siddhartha Gautama.

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:02.970 align:middle line:90%
But it's all the same story--

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:06.420 align:middle line:84%
close encounter, anomalous
experience, and then

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.570 align:middle line:84%
comes forth a child who is
highly intelligent, highly

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.070 align:middle line:90%
conscious.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.090 align:middle line:90%
and significant.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, people might say, look,
these stories, clearly,

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.010 align:middle line:84%
were invented to
give a bit of kudos

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:22.310 align:middle line:84%
to these leaders, who
wanted a bit of mystique,

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
except there's an
even bigger context.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is that there are
women around the world today

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.430 align:middle line:84%
who will describe the
same kind of experience,

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.700 align:middle line:84%
an anomalous experience around
the conception of a child,

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.120 align:middle line:84%
an anomalous experience of
light, an experience of light

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.860 align:middle line:90%
at the birth of a child.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard from a number
of women who will say something

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.850 align:middle line:84%
like I have four children,
the third one is different.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:51.770 align:middle line:10%
The third one has always
been very advanced, very

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:56.900 align:middle line:10%
intelligent, very sensitive,
psychic kind of abilities.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
they'll say, and he

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:84%
says he has memories of
another life on another planet.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.410 align:middle line:90%
That's the context.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:10.490 align:middle line:84%
That is the family of stories
of which the story of Jesus

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:11.720 align:middle line:90%
is a part.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think we only expand
our understanding of things

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:16.790 align:middle line:84%
by putting it in
that big context,

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and realizing it's
ancient and contemporary.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.950 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Sean, would you like
to comment because we only

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.210 align:middle line:90%
have a few minutes left.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want to bring up one
juicy little thing just

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.290 align:middle line:84%
to throw out there for
a future conversation

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:30.865 align:middle line:90%
between the three of us again.

00:41:30.865 --> 00:41:31.665 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:31.665 --> 00:41:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So each take a couple
of minutes if you can.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And tell us how you think it
would benefit humanity best

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.420 align:middle line:84%
to be able to view our place
not just within the cosmos,

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:43.017 align:middle line:84%
but within this
pantheon of beings

00:41:43.017 --> 00:41:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that have been surrounding
us since the beginning.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.642 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: So I'm fascinated with
this concept of what's being

00:41:47.642 --> 00:41:49.420 align:middle line:90%
called convergent evolution.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And convergent
evolution is the theory

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:58.135 align:middle line:84%
that the same kind of codex or
the same kind of genetic code

00:41:58.135 --> 00:42:00.100 align:middle line:84%
is going to create
similar creatures

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.700 align:middle line:90%
in similar environments.

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And so wherever you
get the code landing,

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:84%
if the environment
is similar, you're

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.430 align:middle line:84%
going to get the same kinds
of creatures evolving.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
other side of it is

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.120 align:middle line:84%
the same code in different
kinds of environments is going

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.980 align:middle line:90%
to create different creatures.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And so the code,
basically, is the logos,

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:18.430 align:middle line:90%
as far as I'm concerned.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:19.510 align:middle line:90%
It's the word of God.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.838 align:middle line:84%
And so depending on the
environment in which it lands,

00:42:21.838 --> 00:42:23.380 align:middle line:84%
it's either going
to create creatures

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
look like us or look

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.780 align:middle line:84%
very differently from us,
but it's the same codex.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a different
environment in order

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.100 align:middle line:90%
to articulate the code.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.770 align:middle line:84%
So I was fascinated hearing
an American astronaut

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:38.110 align:middle line:90%
a few years ago from the ISS.

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.270 align:middle line:10%
And he was asked
in an interview,

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:42.730 align:middle line:10%
did you guys do any kind
of medical experimentation

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:46.360 align:middle line:10%
on the ISS when you're away
from the forces of gravity?

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.230 align:middle line:10%
They said, yeah, we did
medical experiments.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.897 align:middle line:10%
And when you're away from-- when
the gravity is much, much less,

00:42:50.897 --> 00:42:55.540 align:middle line:10%
it actually alters the
structure of matter.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.690 align:middle line:10%
And so he said, we did a bunch
of experiments and what we

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:01.510 align:middle line:10%
found out was that
this alleged junk DNA,

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:05.200 align:middle line:10%
which allegedly is 90% of DNA--
which is a ridiculous notion

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.820 align:middle line:10%
that nature ever creates junk--

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.630 align:middle line:10%
but that this junk DNA
needed the appropriate kind

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.710 align:middle line:10%
of environment in which
to express itself.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So like the DNA or
the logos is filled

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:18.140 align:middle line:84%
with all these extraordinary
algorithms of life.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:18.940 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.273 align:middle line:84%
O'LAOIRE: And it takes a
particular environment in order

00:43:21.273 --> 00:43:22.960 align:middle line:90%
to coax it into articulation.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And so a non-gravitational
environment

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.420 align:middle line:84%
will produce a different
part of the genome.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And so depending on where
you live in the solar system,

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.300 align:middle line:84%
in the galaxy,
you're in the cosmos

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.480 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, whether you're
within an energy system,

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.370 align:middle line:84%
the codex is going
to express itself

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.825 align:middle line:84%
in other similar forms or
radically different forms,

00:43:41.825 --> 00:43:43.450 align:middle line:84%
but they're coming
from the same codex.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:46.138 align:middle line:84%
they're coming from the same
logos, the same word of God.

00:43:46.138 --> 00:43:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all
brothers and sisters

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.420 align:middle line:90%
no matter what form we take.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.710 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Just beautiful.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.215 align:middle line:90%
Paul.

00:43:53.215 --> 00:43:54.530 align:middle line:90%
WALLIS: I love that.

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:58.960 align:middle line:10%
I would say that the classic
Orthodox religious view

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.340 align:middle line:10%
of humanity is that we
have appeared on the planet

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.240 align:middle line:10%
and our level of intelligence
and consciousness is fixed.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.890 align:middle line:10%
That's by Divine Fiat--

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.930 align:middle line:10%
what you see is what you get.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, with the
classic evolutionary theory,

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:15.290 align:middle line:90%
we've evolved to here.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:16.090 align:middle line:90%
Aren't we lucky?

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.370 align:middle line:84%
That's as far as
we're going to get.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.800 align:middle line:84%
When I listen to the
ancestral stories,

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.390 align:middle line:90%
I hear a different story.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I hear a story of
continual upgrades.

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I hear a story where our
ancestors were better

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:32.410 align:middle line:84%
able than us at accessing
higher cognitive powers,

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.750 align:middle line:84%
but that those are
still latent, waiting

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:35.920 align:middle line:90%
for us to activate them.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And it goes to
that junk DNA idea.

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:40.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not junk DNA.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of that is ours,
waiting to be activated.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And in the ancestral
stories, the Indigenous

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.240 align:middle line:84%
stories of the planet,
I hear an invitation

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.000 align:middle line:84%
to explore what that
might look like.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.420 align:middle line:84%
How much better a human
experience is possible?

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.610 align:middle line:90%
What are we really capable of?

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.293 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Just
beautiful, both of you.

00:44:59.293 --> 00:45:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how
grateful I am that you've

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:02.870 align:middle line:90%
chosen to do this with us here.

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.460 align:middle line:90%
So again, thank you.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.720 align:middle line:90%
I hope to see you again.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.553 align:middle line:90%
O'LAOIRE: God bless.

00:45:06.553 --> 00:45:07.353 align:middle line:90%
Hugs to you, Paul.

00:45:07.353 --> 00:45:08.561 align:middle line:90%
WALLIS: Yes, Thank you, both.

00:45:08.561 --> 00:45:09.470 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:10.347 align:middle line:90%
O'LAOIRE: Thanks.

00:45:10.347 --> 00:45:12.430 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I hope you all
enjoyed these conversations

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:13.430 align:middle line:90%
as much as I did.
