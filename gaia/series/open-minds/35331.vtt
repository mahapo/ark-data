00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.024 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: It all
began when Gail was an 8

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:84%
or 9-year-old girl playing the
role of a gypsy for a charity

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.229 align:middle line:90%
in her hometown in England.

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:31.465 align:middle line:84%
She would use an upside down
fishbowl as a crystal ball

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:33.134 align:middle line:90%
and tell people their futures.

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:36.504 align:middle line:84%
Lo and behold, people later
began asking for readings saying

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:39.273 align:middle line:84%
that she had genuinely
read their future.

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:41.776 align:middle line:84%
And an event, as an adult,
cemented this reality

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:44.745 align:middle line:84%
and she began looking into
psychic phenomena and seriously

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.248 align:middle line:84%
and found that once it gets
her open it extends beyond the

00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:48.415 align:middle line:90%
human race.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.551 align:middle line:84%
Today she not only
teaches psychic development

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and healing work to
people, but communicates

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.622 align:middle line:90%
with animals, as well.

00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:57.091 align:middle line:84%
I love the story [laughing]
when you were a little girl,

00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:59.126 align:middle line:84%
tell us a little
bit more about that.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:02.563 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a cute start to your,
your journey as a psychic.

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Gail Thackray: Well,
you know, at the time,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.032 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't think
anything about it.

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:08.135 align:middle line:84%
I was a little entrepreneur and
I loved animals, and so I used

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.538 align:middle line:84%
to put together what we
call these garden parties,

00:01:10.538 --> 00:01:12.106 align:middle line:84%
and it was all to raise
money for the animals,

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:14.775 align:middle line:84%
we'd collect things to sell,
and we'd do these little games

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and I always dressed as Gypsy
Rosalie, so I have like,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.614 align:middle line:84%
you know, the, the scarf
and the big, fancy earrings,

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:23.784 align:middle line:84%
and for my crystal
ball, I had a fishbowl

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.152 align:middle line:90%
that was upside down, right?

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:28.022 align:middle line:84%
And people would come in and
say oh, I tell you your future.

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:30.157 align:middle line:84%
It was just for fun, like
a dollar or something.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:34.495 align:middle line:84%
And I forgot about it, years
later, my friends would say

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.565 align:middle line:84%
to me, would you
read for me again?

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:38.966 align:middle line:90%
And I'd say, what do you mean?

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.235 align:middle line:84%
They'd say, you know, you told
me, you read for me that time

00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:43.837 align:middle line:84%
and it all came true, and I
said you're kidding me right?

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.706 align:middle line:84%
It was a fishbowl I was
reading, I made it up!

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:49.009 align:middle line:84%
And I said oh no, and I
said well maybe it was

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.377 align:middle line:90%
because I put that in your mind.

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.246 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I, you know, if I told
you something then, you know,

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:54.048 align:middle line:84%
if I told you you were going
to meet a guy with red hair,

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:55.716 align:middle line:84%
then you would only date
a guy with red hair.

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:58.319 align:middle line:84%
And they said no,
you know, my, my,

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.854 align:middle line:84%
you told me that my grandma
was going to win something

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.757 align:middle line:84%
in the lotto and she did, you
told me that my dad was going

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:84%
to move down south for his job
and we had to move down south,

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:84%
things that you couldn't
possible have known,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.063 align:middle line:84%
and I guess I just thought,
well, you know, its,

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:13.033 align:middle line:84%
[pause] I was just kind
of a little intrigued,

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:17.338 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really think that I
had any kind of psychic ability.

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:18.906 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Did you
do this follow-up readings

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:20.007 align:middle line:90%
for people when they asked

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
or by then did it kind
of blow it for you?

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.044 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't so in the moment.

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:25.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Gail Thackray: I don't, I
don't think I really, you know,

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:28.482 align:middle line:84%
maybe I had a little go, but I
wasn't really, I just thought,

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:30.084 align:middle line:84%
I didn't, I thought it
was one of those kind

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:32.453 align:middle line:84%
of like freaky moments that
maybe I'd somehow guessed.

00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:34.955 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
take it very seriously.

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:37.358 align:middle line:84%
I like spiritual things,
I like psychic things,

00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:38.925 align:middle line:84%
but I wouldn't say
that, you know,

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.928 align:middle line:84%
I thought I had any
talent at all.

00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:46.199 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so, as time went on,
you went on to do a normal life.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.935 align:middle line:84%
You were in the world
of business,

00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:90%
and you did pretty well in that,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and then something
happened when you turned 40.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.275 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah.

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:55.609 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Let's talk about that.

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.046 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Okay, so, I was about
40 and I went to this event,

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.881 align:middle line:84%
with my mom, it was
just some kind

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.751 align:middle line:84%
of like a whole life event and,
again, I like spiritual stuff,

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't, you know,
really that into it,

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.222 align:middle line:84%
and this lady was there
and she was a medium.

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:10.291 align:middle line:84%
And she was going around the
room and she's picking people

00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:12.726 align:middle line:84%
and telling them oh I have
your dad or I have this,

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:15.963 align:middle line:84%
I have a message to you, and
I thought wow, she's amazing.

00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:17.765 align:middle line:90%
Pick me, pick me!

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:19.133 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't.

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:21.669 align:middle line:84%
So, she was having a workshop
that weekend and I said mom,

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.836 align:middle line:84%
let's go to the workshop
because she's going

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.839 align:middle line:84%
to give us readings all weekend
we're bound to, you know,

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.775 align:middle line:84%
get to talk to our
relatives and things, right?

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:31.412 align:middle line:84%
So, I dragged my mom to this
workshop and it was called how

00:03:31.412 --> 00:03:33.314 align:middle line:84%
to become a medium,
which, you know,

00:03:33.314 --> 00:03:36.417 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think anything of, I,
we would just go for readings,

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:39.353 align:middle line:84%
and she starts doing some
exercises and there's a group

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:43.389 align:middle line:84%
of maybe about 30 people,
and you had to pretend

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.893 align:middle line:84%
that a spirit came next to
you and it was to somebody

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.928 align:middle line:84%
in the room, and you have
to ask them, you know,

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
how did you pass away, and
what kind of things did you do

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.566 align:middle line:84%
with your life, and,
and talk to them.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:55.502 align:middle line:84%
So the first person gets
up and their going, oh,

00:03:55.502 --> 00:04:00.874 align:middle line:84%
I sense somebody here, it might
be a man, it might be a woman,

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:02.476 align:middle line:84%
it might be initial A,
or E, or F [laughter].

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Or maybe L, B,
K [laughing], right.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: But yeah, I'm
totally intimidated,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.285 align:middle line:84%
all this person's
feeling somebody!

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:13.887 align:middle line:84%
You know, I thought we just
were supposed to make this up.

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:16.757 align:middle line:84%
So I get up and I said, I
think I've done this wrong,

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:17.824 align:middle line:90%
can I have another girl?

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.425 align:middle line:84%
And she said well
what did you get?

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:22.496 align:middle line:84%
And I said well mine
for this guy over here,

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:24.631 align:middle line:84%
and it says [speaking in
French], he's talking in French,

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:26.033 align:middle line:84%
saying [inaudible],
I don't speak French,

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.302 align:middle line:84%
but I somehow understand
him, and he's telling me

00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:31.138 align:middle line:84%
about his life and what he
did and how he passed away

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:34.208 align:middle line:84%
and this guy, his
grandson, was supposed

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:36.577 align:middle line:84%
to take his scaffolding, his
dad took it, he was supposed

00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:40.147 align:middle line:84%
to take it, he became a pilot,
and I start going on, and then.

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:41.148 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's pretty detailed.

00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:43.183 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: I'm just making
it up, you know?

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:45.619 align:middle line:84%
And, and then I look around,
okay, did he understand that?

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.054 align:middle line:90%
Did anybody else get that?

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And the guy goes, oh my gosh,
that was my grandfather's name.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.793 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to get
the scaffolding company,

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:53.761 align:middle line:90%
I am a pilot.

00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:55.028 align:middle line:84%
And he's completely
freaking out.

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:55.829 align:middle line:90%
He's freaking out!

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:57.965 align:middle line:90%
I'm completely freaking out,

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:01.368 align:middle line:84%
because I have absolutely no
idea how I've done this, and,

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:03.404 align:middle line:90%
to me, I just made it up.

00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:05.339 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel anything,
didn't sense anything,

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.675 align:middle line:84%
everybody else was feeling
stuff, I didn't feel anything.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.645 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole weekend,
I start reading everybody

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:14.248 align:middle line:84%
and telling them, we did
some medical intuitive stuff

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:16.984 align:middle line:84%
where we're supposed to feel
them and sense their energy

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:19.286 align:middle line:84%
and I, you know, told people
about different surgeries

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:20.387 align:middle line:84%
and things that were
wrong with them

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:22.823 align:middle line:84%
and I had no idea
how I was doing this.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:27.227 align:middle line:84%
And I go home that night and it
was like insomnia on steroids.

00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:28.695 align:middle line:90%
Like, [inaudible yelling] ahh!

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.598 align:middle line:84%
Okay, you tell my, you tell
my daughter about that.

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:33.666 align:middle line:84%
No, no, you need to tell my
granddaughter about this and,

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:35.669 align:middle line:84%
and they're telling me stuff
and they're coming and coming

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like well, so I didn't
know whether it was just me,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.576 align:middle line:84%
my imagination, and I went back
the next day and I said okay,

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
this is, this is cool, but
how do I turn this off?

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:84%
[Laughing] Because I
can't live like this!

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.287 align:middle line:84%
And I actually had to learn
to, you know, to shut it down,

00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:55.189 align:middle line:90%
to shut it on and off.

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:57.825 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time I
just, I didn't believe it,

00:05:57.825 --> 00:05:59.993 align:middle line:84%
I kept saying well, I must
have made it up, you know?

00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:02.095 align:middle line:84%
I'm not feeling it,
it's not there.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:05.999 align:middle line:84%
And then the only thing I
really think of was my auntie,

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.935 align:middle line:84%
from England, had
come over visiting

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:11.472 align:middle line:84%
and she does reiki
healing, and she said, oh,

00:06:11.472 --> 00:06:14.408 align:middle line:84%
I know your pretty psychic,
do you want me to do a,

00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:90%
a reiki attune on you?

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.344 align:middle line:90%
Okay, that sounds good, right?

00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:19.213 align:middle line:84%
So she'd done this reiki
attunement, I don't know

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:22.583 align:middle line:84%
if you ever had any kind of
reiki thing like that, but the,

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:24.251 align:middle line:84%
the spirits, basically
she attunes you.

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:26.887 align:middle line:84%
She puts like sacred symbols
inside and you're in tune

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:30.023 align:middle line:84%
to the spirits and you open
up and people feel all kinds

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:33.293 align:middle line:84%
of thoughts going off and I
didn't really feel anything,

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:35.329 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, you
know, but okay!

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:36.563 align:middle line:90%
Kind of interesting.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.532 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing a little
bit of reiki on people

00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:41.668 align:middle line:84%
and they'd say wow, you know,
my, my, I felt that in my knee

00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:44.204 align:middle line:84%
and my knee's better, and I
thought oh it's, it's just kind

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:47.074 align:middle line:84%
of wishful thinking, but, you
know, the more I got into this,

00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
the more I started delving into
this, I realized that, you know,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.713 align:middle line:84%
something was happening
and that,

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:55.749 align:middle line:84%
really that we all do this,
that we're all psychics, we,

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:59.553 align:middle line:84%
we all can channel healing
energy, I didn't feel it

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:00.888 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not so
clairsentient.

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, some people
are very clairsentient,

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.626 align:middle line:84%
meaning their very
empathic, they feel,

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:09.096 align:middle line:84%
I know you're very empathic,
you feel a lot of things.

00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:11.031 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, these are
the people that kind of go

00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
to the mall and they have a
hard time with the energy,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.803 align:middle line:84%
whereas I'm all clairaudience,
so I get more of the message

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:18.372 align:middle line:90%
that comes through to me.

00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:21.608 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not so sensitive to
feeling the energy so much.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:22.743 align:middle line:90%
I've learned to do it now,

00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:25.946 align:middle line:84%
so when I do reiki I
feel it in my body.

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:30.083 align:middle line:84%
So, now I do, you know, I, I
just teach really now and I do,

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:33.687 align:middle line:84%
I'll now do live demonstrations
and somebody will come

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
up on stage and as they're
coming up, I already know,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.793 align:middle line:84%
I'll say oh you have an
issue with your left knee,

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:40.861 align:middle line:90%
or your right shoulder,

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and people say well
how do you do that?

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.399 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm actually doing
is I'm actually feeling it

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:46.366 align:middle line:90%
in my body.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:48.201 align:middle line:84%
And when I first
started doing reiki

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.337 align:middle line:90%
on people, I was a bit confused.

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:52.372 align:middle line:84%
I said oh I've got an itch
in my shoulder, why is this,

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:53.707 align:middle line:90%
you know, what's going on here?

00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:56.343 align:middle line:84%
And it really wasn't my
shoulder, it was really a signal

00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:84%
to say that's where you
need to concentrate on.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.417 align:middle line:84%
And so I do, you know, I do turn
it on and turn it off, but when,

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:06.219 align:middle line:84%
you know, when I say, okay, I'm
going to work with the energy

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:09.523 align:middle line:84%
and I do these healings, I feel
it in my body, I allow them

00:08:09.523 --> 00:08:10.457 align:middle line:90%
to kind of use my body.

00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:11.959 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't hurt or
anything, but,

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:13.126 align:middle line:90%
I just kind of get a little.

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:14.194 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: There's an
awareness there.

00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:14.728 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah!

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:15.929 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.264 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Just like a little
notice, in that part.

00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:19.199 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You said something
that, to me, is very intriguing

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:22.369 align:middle line:84%
about all of this, because as
you say, this is our birthright.

00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:26.373 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can do this, and
I totally agree with that.

00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:32.378 align:middle line:84%
The notion that they told you to
pretend is really a key factor.

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:90%
And that doesn't happen.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.648 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when people
teach these workshops

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.751 align:middle line:84%
and when authors write
about this subject,

00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:39.019 align:middle line:90%
they don't tell you to pretend,

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.188 align:middle line:84%
they give you all these
sophisticated protocols to get

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:45.292 align:middle line:84%
into it, but what, what you
just said that is really key,

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:49.162 align:middle line:84%
because it frees the person
of pressure to perform.

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: You absolutely
hit the nail on the head

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:52.332 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
figured out later was

00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:56.937 align:middle line:84%
that because I thought I was
pretending, I was freed up.

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:59.506 align:middle line:84%
If I'd had said okay, I have
to sense it, I have to feel it,

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:00.741 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I could
have done it,

00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:02.442 align:middle line:84%
because I was expecting
too much.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:03.844 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if I'd just say
okay, well I'm just going

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:07.147 align:middle line:84%
to make it up, and then I just
was freeing up these channels

00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:10.784 align:middle line:84%
and allowing it to come through,
because what happens is,

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:12.953 align:middle line:84%
you know, I raised my
vibrational energy.

00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:15.422 align:middle line:84%
I think spirits are the much
higher energy and they have

00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:17.991 align:middle line:84%
to kind of lower their
energy to come down to us.

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:21.828 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, we can meet,
and to allow yourself to open up

00:09:21.828 --> 00:09:25.565 align:middle line:84%
and to experience that, and
then they can connect with us

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.735 align:middle line:84%
in different ways,
depending on how, you know,

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.537 align:middle line:84%
depending on how we are,
how sensitive we are.

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people hear things,
some people see things,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.308 align:middle line:84%
people that are clairvoyant
is, you know,

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:36.576 align:middle line:90%
it's really quite rare.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.779 align:middle line:84%
If I, if I saw an actual
ghost standing in front of me.

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:40.113 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:41.748 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: I, I would run the
other way, I would freak out!

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:44.284 align:middle line:84%
But I will see in
my mind's eye enough

00:09:44.284 --> 00:09:46.987 align:middle line:84%
that I can describe somebody
standing next to somebody,

00:09:46.987 --> 00:09:48.955 align:middle line:84%
but I don't actually
see them with my eyes.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.357 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, exactly.

00:09:50.357 --> 00:09:53.493 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, does clairvoyance
mean seeing them with your eyes

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:55.362 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to seeing
imagery in your head,

00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:57.431 align:middle line:84%
I always thought it was
kind of a broad term.

00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:58.832 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: It's kind of
broad, clairvoyance,

00:09:58.832 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:84%
well people often think
clairvoyance is kind

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.369 align:middle line:84%
of everything, but
clairvoyance is more the visual.

00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:05.472 align:middle line:84%
So people who are generally
more creative in life and tend

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:08.375 align:middle line:84%
to learn better visually
are the more clairvoyant.

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:11.078 align:middle line:84%
So they see things, and,
you know, we all do this,

00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:13.714 align:middle line:84%
we have these little signs, and
we go oh no it's my imagination.

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:15.882 align:middle line:84%
So people who are more
clairvoyant, they'll see, like,

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:84%
they'll see something out
the corner of the eye,

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.219 align:middle line:84%
and they'll turn around and
they'll be nothing there.

00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:22.756 align:middle line:84%
Or they might start seeing auras
around people or see colors

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:25.492 align:middle line:84%
around people, and they'll say,
she just doesn't look right.

00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And these are people
that say things

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.063 align:middle line:84%
like oh I see what you
mean, very visual people.

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:32.699 align:middle line:84%
And then there are people
that are clairsentient

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:34.367 align:middle line:90%
and that, that's difficult.

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:36.837 align:middle line:90%
That's when people feel things.

00:10:36.837 --> 00:10:40.773 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, its, when
you do that as a healer,

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.609 align:middle line:84%
you definitely have
to put protection and,

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:44.511 align:middle line:84%
and that's as simple as
just saying, you know,

00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:46.246 align:middle line:90%
just put white light around me.

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:48.381 align:middle line:84%
Say the Lord's Prayer,
if you believe that,

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:52.119 align:middle line:84%
or say angels protect me,
whatever it is, and it's good

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.421 align:middle line:84%
for people who are naturally
clairsentient just to do

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:57.124 align:middle line:84%
that before they go to work,
when they get up in the morning.

00:10:57.124 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Because clairsentient people
tend to, you know, they go out

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and they get in a big crowd and
they feel it, they take it on!

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.532 align:middle line:84%
These are people, somebody
comes up to them at work,

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:08.101 align:middle line:84%
they sit next to them and they
go I've never told anybody this

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:10.270 align:middle line:84%
in my life, but I'll
tell you, and they pour

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.506 align:middle line:84%
out all their problems
[laughing].

00:11:12.506 --> 00:11:15.041 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I'm on the plane twice
a week, I hear everything.

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:16.409 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah!

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.711 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I have to really, I've
really learned to just kind

00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:20.747 align:middle line:84%
of turn the other way and
be busy with my, my research

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:23.617 align:middle line:84%
and such because otherwise I'll
spend hours listening to people.

00:11:23.617 --> 00:11:24.451 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Your subconscious.

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:25.786 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And all their stories.

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:27.521 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Subconscious magnet,
people actually come to you

00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:29.589 align:middle line:84%
because they subconsciously
know.

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:32.559 align:middle line:84%
There are people, you know, at
an office doing customer service

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:35.162 align:middle line:84%
and these poor people,
everybody's coming to them

00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:90%
and dumping their problems,

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.965 align:middle line:84%
and what they don't realize
is they're helping them,

00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:41.168 align:middle line:84%
but then maybe a couple days
later they feel really tired

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:41.835 align:middle line:90%
and drained.

00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:43.236 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Really tired.

00:11:43.236 --> 00:11:45.472 align:middle line:84%
And now I've noticed, as I've
worked my intuitive abilities

00:11:45.472 --> 00:11:48.308 align:middle line:84%
through my lifetime and, and
I have certain friends where,

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:51.044 align:middle line:84%
in particular, we'll give
each other intuitive hits,

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:53.613 align:middle line:84%
if we need some information
to just, you know, validation,

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
check in with each other, and
I've noticed that depending

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.853 align:middle line:84%
on the circumstance, it
can be any of the above .

00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:03.523 align:middle line:84%
They'll be one situation,
perhaps, where I hear,

00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:06.593 align:middle line:84%
it's inside my mind, but
I'm hearing words spoken,

00:12:06.593 --> 00:12:09.296 align:middle line:84%
but the next time, maybe
I'm seeing an entire scene,

00:12:09.296 --> 00:12:12.098 align:middle line:84%
sometimes its feeling your
way in and then seeing,

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:15.735 align:middle line:84%
but looking at a person with my
eyes open, I don't see anything.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.938 align:middle line:84%
If I close them with the
intention, then the colors

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and the aura will
show up and so forth.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.644 align:middle line:84%
And so I had assumed that
kind of scene was clairvoyance

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:26.847 align:middle line:84%
and not just seeing
with the eyes open.

00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:28.381 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: It is a form
of clairvoyance.

00:12:28.381 --> 00:12:30.417 align:middle line:84%
People that actual see
people in front of them

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.685 align:middle line:90%
and that is very, very rare.

00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:33.687 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I don't think
I'd want that.

00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:35.388 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: I wouldn't
want that either.

00:12:35.388 --> 00:12:36.723 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:38.725 align:middle line:84%
No, no, that would make life
very confusing and draining,

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:40.126 align:middle line:90%
I would think [laughter].

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:43.263 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And to do this, to me,
you have to turn yourself off

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.632 align:middle line:84%
and turn yourself on
because you don't want to be,

00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:48.235 align:middle line:84%
even sensing feeling,
hearing things all the time.

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:49.769 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be walking up
to the mall and saying hey,

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.338 align:middle line:84%
I have a message
for you [laughter].

00:12:51.338 --> 00:12:52.873 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:56.309 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: You know, I have to be
kind of normal some of the time.

00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:59.379 align:middle line:84%
And, and also, I find that
you get really spacey,

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:01.681 align:middle line:84%
so why not do this
stage healing.

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:04.684 align:middle line:84%
It's a little disconcerting
because as people come up,

00:13:04.684 --> 00:13:08.088 align:middle line:84%
I will tell them things and,
and often, I'll say things oh

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:10.123 align:middle line:84%
like I, I have, I
have a message that,

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:12.492 align:middle line:84%
and I have no idea what's
going to come out my mouth,

00:13:12.492 --> 00:13:14.361 align:middle line:90%
mind, out of my mouth.

00:13:14.361 --> 00:13:16.363 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I'm
going to say next.

00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:18.899 align:middle line:84%
And, and people will say
afterwards, oh, you know,

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:21.568 align:middle line:84%
you have, you brought in
my dad and you said this

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:24.671 align:middle line:84%
or you helped me with
this, and I have no idea.

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:27.841 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
patching memory.

00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:30.744 align:middle line:84%
It's like the spirits
communicate through your mind,

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
but not quite in the
same way as a thought.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.248 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you
have a thought,

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:37.183 align:middle line:84%
you formulate your
sentence, it's in the.

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:37.984 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.085 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Front of your brain.

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:40.253 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's more
streaming, audio streaming.

00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:41.221 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah!

00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:42.055 align:middle line:84%
And it comes and
it's actually stored

00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:43.657 align:middle line:90%
in the back of your memory.

00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:47.127 align:middle line:84%
When you communicate
through this kind of clair,

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:50.931 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyance, clairaudient, when
you communicate with spirit,

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:53.099 align:middle line:84%
it's like they use a
different part of your brain,

00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:55.201 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if it's even
formulated inside the brain

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:56.503 align:middle line:90%
or if it's outside.

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.905 align:middle line:84%
So although I've said it,
it never actually got stored

00:13:58.905 --> 00:14:01.308 align:middle line:84%
in my memory, and I, and I
have no idea what I said.

00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:03.343 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, it's
literally streaming through.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:04.644 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah.

00:14:04.644 --> 00:14:06.746 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So you also had the
experience, in this journey

00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:12.252 align:middle line:84%
of your own embracing your
abilities, of John of God,

00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:14.154 align:middle line:84%
and you went to,
its Brazil isn't it?

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:14.988 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yes.

00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:16.056 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, you went to Brazil.

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what happened there,

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
what you witnessed, but also
what happened within yourself.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.062 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Well, you know,
I was already a medium

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:23.897 align:middle line:84%
and I was teaching
reiki healing,

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:26.433 align:middle line:84%
and I thought well it'd be
interesting to go, but it's not

00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.368 align:middle line:84%
like I have an illness, you
know, I thought you had to,

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.703 align:middle line:84%
you know, have some
terrible illness

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:31.604 align:middle line:90%
to go see somebody like that.

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:33.173 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to go
out of interest,

00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:35.408 align:middle line:90%
but didn't have a purpose.

00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:36.776 align:middle line:90%
And I have a little scent,

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:38.044 align:middle line:84%
and I have different
speakers coming in,

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:40.013 align:middle line:84%
and one day I had
this speaker came,

00:14:40.013 --> 00:14:42.148 align:middle line:84%
and she was an astrologist,
and she was talking

00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:43.717 align:middle line:84%
about where you are
on the planet

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.219 align:middle line:84%
on your birthday sets
up your entire year.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.922 align:middle line:84%
And I said, okay, my birthday's
coming up in a couple months,

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:51.791 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I really
believe it, but where,

00:14:51.791 --> 00:14:53.994 align:middle line:84%
is it okay if I stay
in Los Angeles?

00:14:53.994 --> 00:14:55.762 align:middle line:84%
And she looked it up
and she said oh no, no,

00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:57.297 align:middle line:90%
that would be really bad.

00:14:57.297 --> 00:15:00.033 align:middle line:84%
Bad for finances, bad for
relationships, you know,

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:01.434 align:middle line:90%
you need to go somewhere.

00:15:01.434 --> 00:15:02.669 align:middle line:90%
So I said okay.

00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:04.371 align:middle line:84%
So she went and she did the
star maps and everything

00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:07.273 align:middle line:84%
and she came back and said
okay, the perfect place

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:09.843 align:middle line:90%
for your astrology is Brazil.

00:15:09.843 --> 00:15:11.611 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking, like, you
know, Rio or somewhere.

00:15:11.611 --> 00:15:14.047 align:middle line:84%
And she said no, no,
you're going to go to,

00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:16.716 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] astrology, you
have to go to like Brazilia.

00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:19.219 align:middle line:84%
Not Brazilia, that's
where John of God's,

00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:90%
close by to there, right?

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.921 align:middle line:90%
So, that was it for me.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:23.423 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that it was
a sign from a spirit

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.226 align:middle line:84%
that I was supposed to go so I
hopped a plane and I went down.

00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, John of God
is a, is a full trans-medium.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.066 align:middle line:84%
You know, I connect with
spirit and I get messages,

00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:35.135 align:middle line:84%
but he actually takes
spirits inside him.

00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:36.403 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I would
like to do that.

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:39.706 align:middle line:84%
But he actually has a, a
high-level being comes inside

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:40.974 align:middle line:90%
and takes over his body.

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:42.575 align:middle line:84%
So when you go see him,
you're not really seeing him,

00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:44.477 align:middle line:84%
you're really talking
to a spirit.

00:15:44.477 --> 00:15:47.881 align:middle line:84%
And I met many people there that
have been cured of illnesses

00:15:47.881 --> 00:15:52.919 align:middle line:84%
and they said while I'm back
here, just to experience it.

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:55.121 align:middle line:84%
So why would you come
back if you were cured?

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.389 align:middle line:90%
You know, why are you back?

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:58.858 align:middle line:84%
And they said because
it, it's more than that.

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:00.827 align:middle line:84%
This is what spiritual
healing is about.

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:03.596 align:middle line:90%
It's about shifting your energy.

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:06.966 align:middle line:84%
Because I strongly believe
whatever we have in our life,

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.235 align:middle line:84%
illnesses, or issues
that we have,

00:16:09.235 --> 00:16:11.571 align:middle line:84%
its things that we've
brought to ourselves,

00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
for a learning experience,
it might be, it might not,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.009 align:middle line:84%
you know, it might be something
karmic that we've brought

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:90%
over from a past life.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.014 align:middle line:84%
It might be something from, that
we've held onto from childhood,

00:16:21.014 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:84%
but I do believe that there is
a reason that we have these,

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.718 align:middle line:84%
that it's all part of our
energy, and that's what I do

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:27.954 align:middle line:84%
when I do spiritual
healing is it's not,

00:16:27.954 --> 00:16:29.355 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really healing anybody,

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:32.158 align:middle line:84%
the spirits are actually
shifting a person's energy.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.827 align:middle line:90%
They're allowing them to open up

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:36.729 align:middle line:84%
and receive the healing
from a divine source.

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:40.867 align:middle line:84%
It's not like me giving anybody
anything, it is creating a space

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:43.269 align:middle line:84%
where they feel that
they can connect

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.638 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually them
receiving the healing.

00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:47.373 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, when people
are going to John of God

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:49.476 align:middle line:84%
and they're receiving
these spiritual healings,

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:52.712 align:middle line:84%
they feel fantastic, because
not only is the physical ailment

00:16:52.712 --> 00:16:56.282 align:middle line:84%
taken away, but the energy
of it, so whatever caused

00:16:56.282 --> 00:16:59.052 align:middle line:84%
that is gone, so people come
out going I have a new lease

00:16:59.052 --> 00:17:00.887 align:middle line:90%
on life, I feel fantastic!

00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:03.389 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen this, I've seen
people get out of wheelchairs

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:05.959 align:middle line:84%
and walk and, and
amazing things.

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:11.598 align:middle line:84%
But the most empowering thing
for me was one day I went

00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:15.400 align:middle line:84%
in front of John of God and
I asked about a business.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Because you can ask
for finances, relation,

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.605 align:middle line:90%
anything you want, right?

00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:20.306 align:middle line:84%
So, I didn't really have
anything physical and asked

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.709 align:middle line:84%
about a business, can
you help me with this?

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.512 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah.

00:17:25.512 --> 00:17:27.013 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that's it?

00:17:27.013 --> 00:17:28.281 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're not
going to like kill me,

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:30.483 align:middle line:90%
touch me, something, right?

00:17:30.483 --> 00:17:32.218 align:middle line:84%
And they led me just to
sit in this little chair

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:36.055 align:middle line:84%
and do this meditation, the
five-minute closing prayer.

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.791 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, I'm
sitting there thinking well,

00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:39.125 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really get
anything, right?

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:90%
You know, what did that mean?

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm sitting there
not meditative at all,

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.832 align:middle line:84%
it was like all of
a sudden this,

00:17:45.832 --> 00:17:49.969 align:middle line:84%
this beam of white light
came down over me and I just,

00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:55.542 align:middle line:84%
I felt this emotional, amazing,
loving feeling come over me,

00:17:55.542 --> 00:17:56.843 align:middle line:90%
and it was so strong I,

00:17:56.843 --> 00:17:59.946 align:middle line:84%
I just was completely
pinned back in awe.

00:17:59.946 --> 00:18:02.882 align:middle line:84%
And this voice came
to me and it was,

00:18:02.882 --> 00:18:04.284 align:middle line:84%
it was like a man
actually standing there,

00:18:04.284 --> 00:18:08.488 align:middle line:84%
not like a medium-shaped
voice, and the voice said,

00:18:08.488 --> 00:18:11.558 align:middle line:90%
but was is your higher purpose?

00:18:11.558 --> 00:18:14.027 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, you know, why do you
care about all this stuff?

00:18:14.027 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
This, this is where it's at,
this is where you want to be,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.867 align:middle line:84%
this is where you want to
strive for, and I said, wow,

00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:22.669 align:middle line:84%
I want to share that
with people,

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:26.472 align:middle line:84%
and the voice came
back and said so be it.

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:28.408 align:middle line:84%
And, I know it sounds
corny, but I really felt

00:18:28.408 --> 00:18:31.211 align:middle line:84%
that day I actually
talked to God.

00:18:31.211 --> 00:18:33.379 align:middle line:84%
And I know people have said oh
I had a near-death experience

00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:35.248 align:middle line:84%
and I felt this amazing
energy, you know,

00:18:35.248 --> 00:18:38.518 align:middle line:84%
thank goodness I didn't have to
have a near-death experience,

00:18:38.518 --> 00:18:41.521 align:middle line:84%
but it was strange,
when I came back,

00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:45.225 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a lecture
and I changed it.

00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:47.694 align:middle line:84%
I said hey I'm back, but I
just came back from John of God

00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:50.129 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to share a
little bit about John of God.

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:53.199 align:middle line:84%
And nothing special, just an,
just an e-mail, no pictures

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:54.868 align:middle line:90%
or anything, and a couple

00:18:54.868 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
of minutes later I
get a phone call,

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.905 align:middle line:84%
what was in that
e-mail that you sent.

00:18:58.905 --> 00:18:59.906 align:middle line:90%
I said what do you mean?

00:18:59.906 --> 00:19:01.741 align:middle line:84%
Well I felt this
white light came down

00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:04.377 align:middle line:84%
and I felt this amazing
feeling and I had this problem

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:06.813 align:middle line:84%
with my wrist for years and
years, and I felt this sensation

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.414 align:middle line:84%
in my wrist and now
my wrist is fine.

00:19:08.414 --> 00:19:11.918 align:middle line:84%
And then I got an e-mail
from another lady that said,

00:19:11.918 --> 00:19:14.187 align:middle line:84%
what was your in e-mail,
because I opened it up

00:19:14.187 --> 00:19:18.358 align:middle line:84%
and I felt this warm feeling in
my back and now my back's good.

00:19:18.358 --> 00:19:21.594 align:middle line:84%
And so, we had this event and
all these people showed up.

00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, I felt
it, did you feel it?

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.065 align:middle line:84%
I, I felt this white
light and I felt this,

00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:28.468 align:middle line:84%
and now my knees working
and now this is working

00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:31.237 align:middle line:84%
and I got a check in the
mail I wasn't expecting, and,

00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and they're all, you know,
attributing it to this e-mail.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.243 align:middle line:84%
And I said look, I don't know
what's going on, but let's,

00:19:37.243 --> 00:19:41.447 align:middle line:84%
you know, a meditation and ask
to connect, and I really feel

00:19:41.447 --> 00:19:43.249 align:middle line:84%
that there are energies
in the world,

00:19:43.249 --> 00:19:46.419 align:middle line:84%
that there are these beautiful,
benevolent spirits and they want

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:48.621 align:middle line:84%
to reach out and touch
us, they want to help,

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:52.258 align:middle line:84%
they're all around us, we just
don't often give them permission

00:19:52.258 --> 00:19:56.229 align:middle line:84%
to help us, and when we just
put it out there and say okay,

00:19:56.229 --> 00:19:58.631 align:middle line:84%
I want to be open to this,
I want to have this healing.

00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:01.734 align:middle line:84%
This is available to me and I'm
going to allow this to happen.

00:20:01.734 --> 00:20:04.871 align:middle line:84%
And just by them going,
they were receiving it.

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:07.373 align:middle line:84%
And now I get this, you know,
people all over the world,

00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:10.109 align:middle line:84%
people read my book, they
say, they got the book,

00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:11.844 align:middle line:84%
they didn't even read it,
they put it under their pillow

00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:13.646 align:middle line:84%
and they felt this,
you know, white light,

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:16.316 align:middle line:84%
they felt this amazing
feeling, they, you know,

00:20:16.316 --> 00:20:18.818 align:middle line:84%
they felt like spirits
were working on them,

00:20:18.818 --> 00:20:20.453 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like,
you know, it just,

00:20:20.453 --> 00:20:23.389 align:middle line:84%
it transmutes through
all medium.

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:27.327 align:middle line:84%
So even like viewers at home
watching this, that just say,

00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:30.496 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm open to that, I've
had this bad back long enough,

00:20:30.496 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:84%
now I'm open to having
that, just by watching this,

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:84%
that somehow it goes through
and they're able to receive it.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.806 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And yet, at the same
time, with that energy, I mean,

00:20:39.806 --> 00:20:41.808 align:middle line:84%
that's a wonderful gift
to share with people

00:20:41.808 --> 00:20:45.511 align:middle line:84%
that is also their own
right too, to access.

00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:47.947 align:middle line:84%
And you're really big on that
self-responsibility rather

00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:51.417 align:middle line:84%
than us dialing up a
psychic and saying oh,

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:52.785 align:middle line:90%
tell me what my futures like.

00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:53.886 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work like that,

00:20:53.886 --> 00:20:55.688 align:middle line:84%
at least it doesn't
work well like that.

00:20:55.688 --> 00:20:57.023 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that for a moment.

00:20:57.023 --> 00:20:59.292 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to get into the pets.

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:01.494 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Well, I can read
tarot cards, and, you know,

00:21:01.494 --> 00:21:03.863 align:middle line:84%
I guess I found out I can
read fishbowl [laughing], but,

00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:06.065 align:middle line:90%
you know, I started to realize

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:09.535 align:middle line:84%
that what I was reading was a
person's energy, at that moment,

00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:12.038 align:middle line:84%
which is a contribution of
all the different thoughts

00:21:12.038 --> 00:21:13.406 align:middle line:84%
that they've had up
until that point.

00:21:13.406 --> 00:21:15.007 align:middle line:90%
So they might say okay, well,

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:18.778 align:middle line:84%
explain to me what I
can do with my career.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, all I'm reading
is what are their options,

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.083 align:middle line:84%
right now, from what their
past experiences were.

00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:25.918 align:middle line:90%
I'd say well, wait a minute,

00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:27.453 align:middle line:84%
if you want something,
what do you want?

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:29.188 align:middle line:84%
Let's change your
energy, let's, you know,

00:21:29.188 --> 00:21:33.459 align:middle line:84%
let's get you manifesting what
you want to have in your life.

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:36.229 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it really
made me feel that they like,

00:21:36.229 --> 00:21:40.233 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's nice to go to
somebody who's intuitive to kind

00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:42.535 align:middle line:84%
of get that second perspective,
but there's too many people

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
that just, you know, they want
somebody else to run their life,

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.905 align:middle line:90%
oh, tell me what to do.

00:21:45.905 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's in my
cards and what's my future?

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.208 align:middle line:90%
Or heal me, fix me.

00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:53.079 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about that, it's
about you have the power to,

00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:55.515 align:middle line:84%
to have whatever you
want in your future.

00:21:55.515 --> 00:21:58.951 align:middle line:84%
And the healing, yeah, maybe
I can help to kind of give you

00:21:58.951 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
that zone where you
feel you can open up,

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.022 align:middle line:84%
but it's you that's
doing the healing.

00:22:03.022 --> 00:22:05.024 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And there is
a choice to make.

00:22:05.024 --> 00:22:06.392 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing.

00:22:06.392 --> 00:22:09.228 align:middle line:84%
To ask a psychic
what's, what am I to do?

00:22:09.228 --> 00:22:10.596 align:middle line:90%
You know, what am I going to do

00:22:10.596 --> 00:22:13.699 align:middle line:84%
for a living or where
should I go?

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:17.203 align:middle line:84%
The whole element of
choice is missing from that.

00:22:17.203 --> 00:22:21.774 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's very, I think very
dicey to ask a psychic that kind

00:22:21.774 --> 00:22:23.876 align:middle line:84%
of information, because
you might be able to pluck

00:22:23.876 --> 00:22:27.246 align:middle line:84%
out some random data that you
have collected in the aura

00:22:27.246 --> 00:22:30.116 align:middle line:84%
that could go any direction,
but without a focus of a choice

00:22:30.116 --> 00:22:33.486 align:middle line:84%
of some kind, it's very
difficult to find the accuracy.

00:22:33.486 --> 00:22:35.455 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And that's about,
that's about living our life,

00:22:35.455 --> 00:22:37.523 align:middle line:84%
that's that purpose
is to figure it out.

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:38.357 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:39.725 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: And to make the choices.

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:42.428 align:middle line:84%
You know, I strongly believe
that we do, before we come

00:22:42.428 --> 00:22:46.232 align:middle line:84%
into this life, we choose
certain major points

00:22:46.232 --> 00:22:49.669 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to experience,
but how we experience that,

00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:53.406 align:middle line:84%
how we get to that, and how
long we have to endure that is,

00:22:53.406 --> 00:22:55.308 align:middle line:90%
is choice, that we have a lot

00:22:55.308 --> 00:22:58.478 align:middle line:84%
of freewill while we're
here to change things.

00:22:58.478 --> 00:23:01.681 align:middle line:84%
And that, you know, a reading is
simply looking up what you are,

00:23:01.681 --> 00:23:02.615 align:middle line:90%
where you are right now.

00:23:02.615 --> 00:23:03.683 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: A frozen moment in time.

00:23:03.683 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Exactly.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.585 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yep, exactly.

00:23:05.585 --> 00:23:08.955 align:middle line:84%
Okay. So, how did this
bridge over into animals?

00:23:08.955 --> 00:23:12.124 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Well, I had been a
medium maybe about six months,

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:16.729 align:middle line:84%
and at a little shop, like
a little crystal shop,

00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:19.866 align:middle line:84%
and the lady said oh there's a
girl going to be coming talking

00:23:19.866 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:90%
about animal communication.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.903 align:middle line:84%
And I thought oh, that's
interesting, you know?

00:23:23.903 --> 00:23:26.739 align:middle line:84%
So we, we stayed and, and we
watched this, and she's talking

00:23:26.739 --> 00:23:27.607 align:middle line:90%
about this, and I thought oh,

00:23:27.607 --> 00:23:28.975 align:middle line:84%
she's been doing
it all her life.

00:23:28.975 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, I thought, you know,
you had to be born that way.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.146 align:middle line:84%
Well I thought all
psychics were born that way,

00:23:33.146 --> 00:23:34.881 align:middle line:84%
they're all a little
weird, you know.

00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:36.782 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, you know,
if you could communicate

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:38.718 align:middle line:84%
with animals, you've been
doing it since you were young,

00:23:38.718 --> 00:23:41.821 align:middle line:84%
which we all have, we just
don't pay attention to it.

00:23:41.821 --> 00:23:44.257 align:middle line:84%
So she explains how it's done,
you know, and everything,

00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:46.025 align:middle line:84%
and then she goes off
to do private readings

00:23:46.025 --> 00:23:47.994 align:middle line:84%
and people have brought
photos of their animals.

00:23:47.994 --> 00:23:51.597 align:middle line:84%
So I said, oh, can I have a
look at your photo and see

00:23:51.597 --> 00:23:53.199 align:middle line:90%
if I get anything, you know?

00:23:53.199 --> 00:23:55.535 align:middle line:84%
So first a lady gives
me a picture of a dog.

00:23:55.535 --> 00:23:59.772 align:middle line:84%
And, I'm looking at this dog and
I, immediately, I feel like I'm

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:02.608 align:middle line:84%
in the dog, my tails wagging,
and I'm all excited, you know,

00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:06.612 align:middle line:84%
and I say, you know, I'm really
good with the new, with the cats

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:07.647 align:middle line:84%
that they got, because,
you know,

00:24:07.647 --> 00:24:09.215 align:middle line:84%
most dogs are not
good with the cats.

00:24:09.215 --> 00:24:12.218 align:middle line:84%
Now I hid my bone around the
back of the, the doghouse,

00:24:12.218 --> 00:24:13.719 align:middle line:90%
but I'm really good with them.

00:24:13.719 --> 00:24:14.854 align:middle line:90%
And she, the lady goes,

00:24:14.854 --> 00:24:17.356 align:middle line:84%
that's really strange,
we just got two cats.

00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:19.959 align:middle line:84%
Now all of a sudden I'm in
the cats and I'm looking

00:24:19.959 --> 00:24:21.694 align:middle line:84%
out the window at
these squirrels,

00:24:21.694 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:84%
these pesky little squirrels
that are up the street

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:25.898 align:middle line:84%
and we want to get
out there and,

00:24:25.898 --> 00:24:28.267 align:middle line:84%
and there's my dad he's sitting
on the porch every afternoon,

00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:32.004 align:middle line:84%
having a drink of a dark liquid,
and we want to get out there.

00:24:32.004 --> 00:24:35.308 align:middle line:84%
And the lady says, that's so
funny because they're sitting

00:24:35.308 --> 00:24:36.742 align:middle line:84%
at the window, my
husband sits out there

00:24:36.742 --> 00:24:40.079 align:middle line:84%
with a beer [laughing], I was
thinking it was a Coke, but.

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:42.815 align:middle line:84%
And, and I thought well
I'm making this up.

00:24:42.815 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Just, you know, lucky guess.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.687 align:middle line:84%
And then another lady gives
me a picture of a cat,

00:24:47.687 --> 00:24:50.356 align:middle line:84%
and immediately I feel like
I'm in the body of the cat.

00:24:50.356 --> 00:24:53.893 align:middle line:84%
I see these big slippers right
in front of my face going around

00:24:53.893 --> 00:24:55.528 align:middle line:90%
and around and I'm so excited.

00:24:55.528 --> 00:24:58.631 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the woman,
it's kind of strange,

00:24:58.631 --> 00:25:00.433 align:middle line:84%
but do you have a
pair of slippers

00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:02.468 align:middle line:84%
with a little pink
ball on the end?

00:25:02.468 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:90%
She goes, yeah.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.807 align:middle line:84%
And I said do you get on the
exercise bike in the morning?

00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:09.242 align:middle line:90%
And she goes yeah I do!

00:25:09.242 --> 00:25:12.278 align:middle line:84%
And I said I think your
cat likes to watch you.

00:25:12.278 --> 00:25:16.282 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I was seeing,

00:25:16.282 --> 00:25:18.517 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing the cat
watching this move [laughter].

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:20.786 align:middle line:84%
And, and, you know, I was
reading person after person

00:25:20.786 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and I just, I said, I kept
thinking maybe I'm making it up,

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.526 align:middle line:84%
but I realized it's exactly
the same way, the same way

00:25:27.526 --> 00:25:30.963 align:middle line:84%
that I was bringing in loved
ones from spirit, I was bringing

00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:34.166 align:middle line:84%
in animals and it didn't matter
whether they were in spirit

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:36.902 align:middle line:84%
or whether they were
actually alive

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:39.005 align:middle line:90%
in person, it's the same thing.

00:25:39.005 --> 00:25:42.608 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that when
you tap in and you open up,

00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:44.343 align:middle line:84%
it's not like you learn
animal communication,

00:25:44.343 --> 00:25:45.878 align:middle line:84%
that's one thing,
you learn mediumship.

00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:49.081 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know, once you
open up, you can do all of it.

00:25:49.081 --> 00:25:50.916 align:middle line:90%
It's not one or the other.

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:53.319 align:middle line:84%
You become more intuitive,
you life runs better

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:54.887 align:middle line:90%
because you're more in tune

00:25:54.887 --> 00:25:56.322 align:middle line:84%
to what your guides
are telling you.

00:25:56.322 --> 00:25:58.724 align:middle line:84%
There's a world out
there and one

00:25:58.724 --> 00:26:00.426 align:middle line:84%
of the things you can
do is you can speak

00:26:00.426 --> 00:26:02.028 align:middle line:84%
to your animals,
and they're so cute!

00:26:02.028 --> 00:26:03.429 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:04.997 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about some of
the things that you've found.

00:26:04.997 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about cats and
their healing properties.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.936 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Well, you know, I,
sometimes I've met these cats

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:13.939 align:middle line:90%
that are Egyptian healing cats.

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:17.176 align:middle line:84%
You know, very proud
Egyptian healing cats

00:26:17.176 --> 00:26:19.979 align:middle line:84%
that [inaudible] were the
great, great cats and their,

00:26:19.979 --> 00:26:21.781 align:middle line:84%
their humans are
like these, you know,

00:26:21.781 --> 00:26:24.517 align:middle line:84%
the human that brings them, they
used to bring them the people

00:26:24.517 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and now they're still like
servants in this life.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.889 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the, just the
regular, you know, housecats,

00:26:29.889 --> 00:26:34.560 align:middle line:84%
but they all have a purpose,
every animal has a role in life.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.662 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes if they're the
only animal in the house,

00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:39.231 align:middle line:84%
they might have to, you know, to
take on several different roles.

00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:41.434 align:middle line:84%
But that's why, if we've
got several animals,

00:26:41.434 --> 00:26:43.169 align:middle line:84%
if they start arguing
about something,

00:26:43.169 --> 00:26:46.672 align:middle line:84%
it's maybe because one's got
the role of the healing dog

00:26:46.672 --> 00:26:51.077 align:middle line:84%
and one is the, the intelligent
cat that's going to help them,

00:26:51.077 --> 00:26:53.579 align:middle line:84%
you know, writing a book or
something, and one's stepping

00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:54.814 align:middle line:84%
on the other's toes,
like, wait a minute,

00:26:54.814 --> 00:26:56.148 align:middle line:90%
that's my role [laughter].

00:26:56.148 --> 00:26:58.084 align:middle line:84%
So I tell them if
they've got animals

00:26:58.084 --> 00:27:00.152 align:middle line:84%
that are arguing a little
bit, you need to tell them oh,

00:27:00.152 --> 00:27:04.557 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate you,
you're my top, top greeter dog,

00:27:04.557 --> 00:27:07.827 align:middle line:84%
you make everybody feel at home,
that's your role, thank you,

00:27:07.827 --> 00:27:11.597 align:middle line:84%
and, and you're, you're my
cat that is my healing cat

00:27:11.597 --> 00:27:14.433 align:middle line:84%
and just keep the role separate
and tell them that they,

00:27:14.433 --> 00:27:17.269 align:middle line:84%
they come into our
life because they feel

00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that they're our partners, they
have a purpose and they know

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.509 align:middle line:84%
so much more than
you'd ever think.

00:27:23.509 --> 00:27:25.845 align:middle line:84%
I mean they know conversations
we're having at work,

00:27:25.845 --> 00:27:26.946 align:middle line:90%
they know what's going on.

00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:28.514 align:middle line:84%
Not even just, you know,
things they can see

00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:30.449 align:middle line:90%
but things they can't see.

00:27:30.449 --> 00:27:31.784 align:middle line:90%
Even the future.

00:27:31.784 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I had these, I had a lady
once and she gave me a picture

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.457 align:middle line:84%
of her cats, and the cats told
me that there was a special room

00:27:38.457 --> 00:27:40.025 align:middle line:84%
in the house they were
not allowed to go in.

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:43.395 align:middle line:84%
And that people would leave
their shoes outside the room

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:45.431 align:middle line:84%
and they would go and they
would know who was in the room,

00:27:45.431 --> 00:27:47.566 align:middle line:84%
they'd be smelling
their shoes outside.

00:27:47.566 --> 00:27:50.069 align:middle line:84%
And she laughed, she said well
I'm a piano teacher, so yeah,

00:27:50.069 --> 00:27:52.471 align:middle line:84%
and my students come
and they have

00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:53.539 align:middle line:84%
to leave their shoes
outside [inaudible].

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:56.509 align:middle line:84%
And the cat said tell
her not to worry,

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:57.710 align:middle line:90%
and they showed me this vision

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.613 align:middle line:84%
of little ballet
shoes all lined up.

00:28:00.613 --> 00:28:04.316 align:middle line:84%
And she said oh, she said I just
put up an ad at the ballet shoe

00:28:04.316 --> 00:28:06.318 align:middle line:84%
to try to get clients because I
was really worried I didn't have

00:28:06.318 --> 00:28:07.653 align:middle line:90%
enough clients.

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:10.389 align:middle line:84%
So they were seeing the future
and they were seeing that,

00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:11.791 align:middle line:90%
that was coming to pass.

00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:14.426 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually ask
our animals about things

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:15.761 align:middle line:90%
in the, in the future.

00:28:15.761 --> 00:28:18.497 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And they're very eager
to share their information

00:28:18.497 --> 00:28:20.499 align:middle line:84%
with you and, and
also their desires.

00:28:20.499 --> 00:28:21.834 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to take a look

00:28:21.834 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:84%
at a reading you did just
before we started the interview

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.906 align:middle line:90%
with a dog.

00:28:26.906 --> 00:28:29.942 align:middle line:84%
And I won't say anything more,
a dog and his owner, Becky.

00:28:29.942 --> 00:28:32.077 align:middle line:90%
And let's take a look at that.

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:33.312 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Hi Becky.

00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:37.249 align:middle line:84%
So this is your love bug
and he is just a sweetheart.

00:28:37.249 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: He is.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.084 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:41.453 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: He's, he definitely
is a healing dog,

00:28:41.453 --> 00:28:43.455 align:middle line:90%
he's your healing partner.

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:47.259 align:middle line:84%
So, he, he'll come whenever
you're feeling a little stressed

00:28:47.259 --> 00:28:49.562 align:middle line:84%
out or whether, if there's
anything wrong with you, he'll,

00:28:49.562 --> 00:28:52.464 align:middle line:84%
he'll come and put his head on
your lap and he just wants you

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:56.435 align:middle line:84%
to stroke him and, and actually
part of it is what they do.

00:28:56.435 --> 00:28:59.905 align:middle line:84%
When you stroke them, you're
actually helping your energy

00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:02.608 align:middle line:84%
and releasing all that, so we
think that we're just, you know,

00:29:02.608 --> 00:29:04.143 align:middle line:84%
loving them and it
just feels nice,

00:29:04.143 --> 00:29:06.612 align:middle line:84%
but they're actually
decompressing our energy

00:29:06.612 --> 00:29:09.415 align:middle line:84%
and the thing is you're
very clairsentient.

00:29:09.415 --> 00:29:10.916 align:middle line:90%
That means you take on a lot

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:13.152 align:middle line:84%
of other peoples
feeling, very empathic.

00:29:13.152 --> 00:29:15.688 align:middle line:84%
And people come up to
you and they say oh,

00:29:15.688 --> 00:29:18.757 align:middle line:84%
I never told anybody this, but
I'm going to tell you and you,

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:22.027 align:middle line:84%
your kind one of these that
helps a lot of people out and,

00:29:22.027 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and always, never
say no to anybody.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.567 align:middle line:84%
And so, because you do that,
you, you tend to also kind

00:29:28.567 --> 00:29:31.337 align:middle line:84%
of get a bit drained sometimes
and you don't know why.

00:29:31.337 --> 00:29:33.906 align:middle line:84%
So you're probably dealing
day and day out with a lot

00:29:33.906 --> 00:29:36.508 align:middle line:84%
of different people,
is that right?

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: Oh yes.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.011 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And when you come
home, he definitely comes

00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:42.581 align:middle line:84%
over to you and, and wants
to put his head on your lap

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and have you stroke
him and stuff.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.986 align:middle line:84%
But he says he exercises
you too.

00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:49.455 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't like he would
be very athletic anymore.

00:29:49.455 --> 00:29:50.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: He does.

00:29:50.222 --> 00:29:50.856 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: But, he, he loves.

00:29:50.856 --> 00:29:51.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: He does.

00:29:51.557 --> 00:29:52.791 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: To, to run and.

00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:53.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: The healing thing
is right on too though,

00:29:53.592 --> 00:29:55.461 align:middle line:90%
I, I have to tell you.

00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:59.098 align:middle line:84%
If I as much as sniffle,
he is so in tune with it.

00:29:59.098 --> 00:30:01.367 align:middle line:84%
He stops whatever he is
doing, he looks at me,

00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:04.036 align:middle line:84%
and he comes right to my side,
if he thinks I'm about to

00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:06.405 align:middle line:84%
like a shed or tear
or anything like that.

00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:07.773 align:middle line:90%
But yes, he exercises me too.

00:30:07.773 --> 00:30:09.742 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And he said
there was a little bit

00:30:09.742 --> 00:30:12.077 align:middle line:90%
with your left hip going on.

00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:15.214 align:middle line:84%
He had a little bit with his
back left hip that's doing

00:30:15.214 --> 00:30:17.616 align:middle line:84%
better now, but for a while
he was having a little bit

00:30:17.616 --> 00:30:20.219 align:middle line:84%
of a problem and that's
actually related to you,

00:30:20.219 --> 00:30:22.388 align:middle line:84%
and your left side's
always not moving forward.

00:30:22.388 --> 00:30:24.823 align:middle line:84%
So you're kind of
stuck at a crossroads.

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:26.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: You are so
right about my left hip.

00:30:26.926 --> 00:30:29.528 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] You are
freaking me out.

00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:32.097 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, now I don't know anything,

00:30:32.097 --> 00:30:34.099 align:middle line:84%
anything that he's had
going on with his hip.

00:30:34.099 --> 00:30:35.434 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah, well they feel it.

00:30:35.434 --> 00:30:37.937 align:middle line:84%
So, sometimes if you
notice something on your,

00:30:37.937 --> 00:30:40.239 align:middle line:84%
on your animal and then
you think well what's going

00:30:40.239 --> 00:30:42.708 align:middle line:84%
on with me, and you'll find
you have the same thing, the,

00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:44.376 align:middle line:90%
sympathy, sympathetic with that.

00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:46.111 align:middle line:84%
But he's been helping
you through that and you,

00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:48.147 align:middle line:84%
you're doing very well
at getting through that.

00:30:48.147 --> 00:30:51.517 align:middle line:84%
But he, he said oh she
definitely did the exercise,

00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:53.452 align:middle line:84%
and I make her throw
sticks for me.

00:30:53.452 --> 00:30:55.254 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't like to
give them back,

00:30:55.254 --> 00:30:56.755 align:middle line:90%
but he, he likes to throw it.

00:30:56.755 --> 00:30:57.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: Yes, he's not
a fetcher [laughing].

00:30:57.756 --> 00:30:59.692 align:middle line:90%
But yes, he loves sticks.

00:30:59.692 --> 00:31:01.093 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. He'll go after them
and then he'll just lay

00:31:01.093 --> 00:31:02.528 align:middle line:90%
down and chew on them.

00:31:02.528 --> 00:31:04.129 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And he likes the water,
he loves to go in the water,

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:07.433 align:middle line:84%
he likes to go upstream
when he can.

00:31:07.433 --> 00:31:10.035 align:middle line:84%
There's not many times that
you get to, or you don't get

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:11.637 align:middle line:84%
to let him out as
much as he would like.

00:31:11.637 --> 00:31:13.372 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
places you'd go,

00:31:13.372 --> 00:31:16.141 align:middle line:84%
he wishes you'd go more
often, and don't worry

00:31:16.141 --> 00:31:18.811 align:middle line:84%
that I'm getting older, I
can still do these things.

00:31:18.811 --> 00:31:20.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: Yeah.

00:31:20.045 --> 00:31:23.148 align:middle line:84%
He still runs like he's
two-years-old, it's amazing.

00:31:23.148 --> 00:31:25.484 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: What's your
favorite treat?

00:31:25.484 --> 00:31:28.821 align:middle line:84%
Oh, he says it's pretty
healthy at your house.

00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:30.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: Yeah.

00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:31.523 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: You eat pretty healthy,
so there's not a lot of,

00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:34.893 align:middle line:84%
you know, yummy leftover,
dog scraps at your house.

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:36.028 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: Yeah.

00:31:36.028 --> 00:31:37.663 align:middle line:84%
I try not to feed him
too much from my plate.

00:31:37.663 --> 00:31:38.797 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:38.797 --> 00:31:40.099 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And now, is there
other animals at home

00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:42.901 align:middle line:84%
because I'm seeing a lot of
other animals around him?

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:45.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: We work with
a, we work in an office

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:46.472 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of other animals.

00:31:46.472 --> 00:31:47.473 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Oh, okay.

00:31:47.473 --> 00:31:48.374 align:middle line:84%
And he gets to see
the other animals?

00:31:48.374 --> 00:31:48.874 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: He does.

00:31:48.874 --> 00:31:49.708 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:50.909 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: And he helps them too.

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:52.911 align:middle line:84%
So if, if any of them
are not feeling too good,

00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:56.148 align:middle line:84%
it's nice to bring him
around and he says,

00:31:56.148 --> 00:31:57.816 align:middle line:90%
has your dad passed away?:

00:31:57.816 --> 00:31:58.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: No.

00:31:58.884 --> 00:31:59.585 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Okay, then
it's your grandfather

00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:00.452 align:middle line:90%
on your father's side.

00:32:00.452 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: Yes.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.321 align:middle line:90%
Both grandfathers'.

00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:03.522 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Your grandfather
on your father's side,

00:32:03.522 --> 00:32:05.324 align:middle line:90%
he comes around sometimes.

00:32:05.324 --> 00:32:06.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: Are you kidding?

00:32:06.158 --> 00:32:07.126 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: He used to love dogs, so.

00:32:07.126 --> 00:32:07.793 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes.

00:32:07.793 --> 00:32:08.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: How sweet!

00:32:08.494 --> 00:32:09.795 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Feels his energy.

00:32:09.795 --> 00:32:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: That's sweet.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:15.134 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: You used to give
him actual proper bones.

00:32:15.134 --> 00:32:16.201 align:middle line:84%
You used to get them
from somewhere

00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and he'd love one
of those again.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:20.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: [Laughing] You know,
I just bought some recently.

00:32:20.239 --> 00:32:22.074 align:middle line:84%
And I gave him one a
couple of weeks ago.

00:32:22.074 --> 00:32:23.675 align:middle line:84%
And I have a whole
bag full at home.

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:24.777 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: But he likes
to bury them.

00:32:24.777 --> 00:32:26.245 align:middle line:84%
He likes to get them
all dirty first,

00:32:26.245 --> 00:32:29.148 align:middle line:90%
before he eats them [laughter].

00:32:29.148 --> 00:32:31.450 align:middle line:90%
And he loves his bed.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.752 align:middle line:84%
It's, you keep thinking
I'm going to change it

00:32:33.752 --> 00:32:34.853 align:middle line:84%
because it's getting
kind of old,

00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:36.989 align:middle line:84%
but don't change his
bed, he loves that one.

00:32:36.989 --> 00:32:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: Are you serious?

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.692 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: It's kind of all black,
hairy now and you keep trying

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:41.794 align:middle line:90%
to clean it up, but he.

00:32:41.794 --> 00:32:43.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: Yeah, well
and it's lumpy, and I,

00:32:43.162 --> 00:32:45.764 align:middle line:84%
I keep thinking it's not
comfortable for him, and, okay,

00:32:45.764 --> 00:32:47.166 align:middle line:90%
I will hang on to that.

00:32:47.166 --> 00:32:50.035 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And does he like to sleep
sometimes by, a, a dishwasher

00:32:50.035 --> 00:32:53.505 align:middle line:84%
or a, a washing machine, because
I hear it going, vibrating,

00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:55.641 align:middle line:90%
and he likes to be in that room.

00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:57.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: Maybe in
my hallway next

00:32:57.209 --> 00:32:58.744 align:middle line:90%
to the washer and dryer, yeah.

00:32:58.744 --> 00:33:01.346 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Hey, well, he's
a just a sweetheart.

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:02.748 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: Oh, thank you.

00:33:02.748 --> 00:33:03.749 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And, yeah, he's actually
pretty healthy even though he's

00:33:03.749 --> 00:33:04.616 align:middle line:84%
getting on, he's,
he's going to be,

00:33:04.616 --> 00:33:05.617 align:middle line:90%
he's going to last a long time.

00:33:05.617 --> 00:33:06.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: Oh, that's
good to know.

00:33:06.452 --> 00:33:07.553 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: And he's very healthy.

00:33:07.553 --> 00:33:09.288 align:middle line:84%
So, just decompress
your energy a little bit

00:33:09.288 --> 00:33:11.957 align:middle line:90%
when you come back from work.

00:33:11.957 --> 00:33:15.294 align:middle line:84%
Just little white light and just
have to de-stress a little bit

00:33:15.294 --> 00:33:17.029 align:middle line:84%
so he doesn't take
on so much, but.

00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:19.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: So he doesn't take
on all of my stuff, yeah.

00:33:19.665 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: You know, it's
hard to pick up a name,

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.771 align:middle line:84%
but I'm getting something,
something like a boy or big

00:33:25.771 --> 00:33:30.275 align:middle line:84%
or black or [pause]
fluffy bear, teddy bear.

00:33:30.275 --> 00:33:30.809 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: Bear.

00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Bear.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.211 align:middle line:90%
Oh, okay, good, good.

00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:33.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Becky: It is bear.

00:33:33.612 --> 00:33:36.281 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually mistaken for a
bear when we're hiking at times.

00:33:36.281 --> 00:33:38.317 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: I knew it was something
to do with the way he looked

00:33:38.317 --> 00:33:39.718 align:middle line:90%
and his color or something.

00:33:39.718 --> 00:33:40.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: Yeah, yeah,
you got it.

00:33:40.786 --> 00:33:41.987 align:middle line:90%
He's bear.

00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:43.422 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Love bug, although
he gets different names.

00:33:43.422 --> 00:33:45.691 align:middle line:84%
>> Becky: Oh my gosh, I have
a million names for him.

00:33:45.691 --> 00:33:47.392 align:middle line:84%
Ones that I couldn't
even tell you,

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:50.095 align:middle line:84%
they're so embarrassing,
but yeah.

00:33:50.095 --> 00:33:51.296 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That was so sweet.

00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:53.499 align:middle line:84%
And I, everybody in the
studio was really happy

00:33:53.499 --> 00:33:55.067 align:middle line:90%
when you nailed the name Bear,

00:33:55.067 --> 00:33:57.469 align:middle line:84%
somebody teddy bear,
and his name is Bear.

00:33:57.469 --> 00:34:00.105 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the, the, I heard
her talking a little later on

00:34:00.105 --> 00:34:04.343 align:middle line:84%
and it really, it gives
such of a, I don't know,

00:34:04.343 --> 00:34:06.745 align:middle line:84%
a warmth of understanding
to people to know

00:34:06.745 --> 00:34:09.747 align:middle line:84%
that their dog has, or
their cat, either one,

00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:11.416 align:middle line:84%
has a much greater
role in their life

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:12.851 align:middle line:84%
than anything they've
anticipated.

00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:14.452 align:middle line:84%
I think once you
understand that,

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:16.455 align:middle line:84%
you can go into a deeper
partnership with them

00:34:16.455 --> 00:34:18.891 align:middle line:84%
and I love that, that was
a really good reading.

00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:20.792 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: But, you know,
Becky's also communicating.

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:23.095 align:middle line:84%
We all are already
communicating with our animals.

00:34:23.095 --> 00:34:26.999 align:middle line:84%
You know, they, they can give
us the message, very clearly,

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:28.767 align:middle line:84%
they hear everything,
they give us the message,

00:34:28.767 --> 00:34:32.104 align:middle line:84%
it's us that have to take
a little time to learn how

00:34:32.104 --> 00:34:35.606 align:middle line:84%
to hear them, but we are already
in tune with our animals,

00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:37.743 align:middle line:84%
and it's not about
learning how to do it,

00:34:37.743 --> 00:34:40.746 align:middle line:84%
it's more about just learning
how to remove the blocks.

00:34:40.746 --> 00:34:44.516 align:middle line:84%
So when I teach people, we do a
lot of exercises on pretending,

00:34:44.516 --> 00:34:47.653 align:middle line:84%
allowing yourself, having a
go, and removing the blocks.

00:34:47.653 --> 00:34:50.055 align:middle line:84%
And people are always amazed
at how well they can do it.

00:34:50.055 --> 00:34:53.292 align:middle line:84%
But more people are very in tune
with their animals and actually.

00:34:53.292 --> 00:34:55.961 align:middle line:84%
They know when, they know
when something's going on.

00:34:55.961 --> 00:34:57.663 align:middle line:84%
They know when they're not quite
right, they know when you got

00:34:57.663 --> 00:34:59.631 align:middle line:90%
to go out, that kind of thing.

00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:02.067 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I'm, I'm more of a
dog person than a cat person.

00:35:02.067 --> 00:35:04.903 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had a cat for
a couple of decades now.

00:35:04.903 --> 00:35:07.406 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: I can tell you're
a dog person [laughing].

00:35:07.406 --> 00:35:10.709 align:middle line:84%
You have a couple of dogs
around you, are they,

00:35:10.709 --> 00:35:11.944 align:middle line:90%
are they around right now?

00:35:11.944 --> 00:35:12.878 align:middle line:90%
A couple of dogs?

00:35:12.878 --> 00:35:14.613 align:middle line:90%
You have many more in spirit.

00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:18.317 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if they're all
your dogs, you've also helped

00:35:18.317 --> 00:35:21.787 align:middle line:84%
with charities and things
too, but you've got a big dog

00:35:21.787 --> 00:35:25.490 align:middle line:84%
in spirit, but now do you
have two fellow big ones?

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.792 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:29.261 align:middle line:84%
The, the big one died, and
now we have two little ones

00:35:29.261 --> 00:35:30.896 align:middle line:84%
with big personalities
[laughing].

00:35:30.896 --> 00:35:34.867 align:middle line:84%
The other one died about two
months ago, and then, in fact,

00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:39.304 align:middle line:84%
a very strange thing happened,
it was after he died, and we,

00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:40.873 align:middle line:84%
it was just heartbreaking
for us,

00:35:40.873 --> 00:35:44.009 align:middle line:90%
of course, but it was his time.

00:35:44.009 --> 00:35:47.246 align:middle line:84%
We were not planning on
getting another dog, and then,

00:35:47.246 --> 00:35:50.782 align:middle line:84%
someone sent an e-mail to,
so an animal rescue person,

00:35:50.782 --> 00:35:53.852 align:middle line:84%
who had known that we had lost
[inaudible], sent a little,

00:35:53.852 --> 00:35:56.922 align:middle line:90%
a little e-mail with a picture

00:35:56.922 --> 00:35:59.791 align:middle line:84%
of this strange-looking little
dog, a little terrier mix,

00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:03.328 align:middle line:84%
and something in his eyes, it
was, I was not, I was not going

00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:07.633 align:middle line:84%
to do this, and I, I, so I
texted the, the picture forward

00:36:07.633 --> 00:36:10.002 align:middle line:84%
to my husband and said, do
you know anyone who might

00:36:10.002 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:90%
like this little creature.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.805 align:middle line:84%
And he said he's kind of
cute, and it was just,

00:36:13.805 --> 00:36:14.907 align:middle line:90%
that's all I needed to hear.

00:36:14.907 --> 00:36:16.041 align:middle line:90%
Oh he is, isn't he?

00:36:16.041 --> 00:36:17.376 align:middle line:90%
Isn't he darling?

00:36:17.376 --> 00:36:21.246 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up with that one,
but then we were with one

00:36:21.246 --> 00:36:25.083 align:middle line:84%
of our interviewees doing an
interview, and through this,

00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:28.253 align:middle line:84%
kind of a, a situation
where mediumship would come

00:36:28.253 --> 00:36:30.022 align:middle line:90%
up quite naturally, it came

00:36:30.022 --> 00:36:34.693 align:middle line:84%
up that our deceased dog had
brought this little dog to us.

00:36:34.693 --> 00:36:36.061 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Absolutely.

00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:37.863 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so let's talk about
that, and he was very proud

00:36:37.863 --> 00:36:40.499 align:middle line:84%
of himself for bringing this
wonderful, little male dog

00:36:40.499 --> 00:36:42.534 align:middle line:90%
to us who is adorable.

00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:46.204 align:middle line:84%
So how, let's talk about dogs
and their invisible friends

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and also dogs and our
long-term relationship with them

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.977 align:middle line:84%
and how they do these
things to help us, you know,

00:36:51.977 --> 00:36:53.278 align:middle line:90%
have what we need in our lives.

00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:54.579 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah.

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:57.783 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, a lot of the
time they come back to us

00:36:57.783 --> 00:37:00.786 align:middle line:84%
in our life, so you might
have had, you have another,

00:37:00.786 --> 00:37:04.456 align:middle line:84%
another dog at home, this one in
spirit, now the one in spirit,

00:37:04.456 --> 00:37:06.058 align:middle line:90%
do you call him Vinny?

00:37:06.058 --> 00:37:06.758 align:middle line:90%
Finny?

00:37:06.758 --> 00:37:07.292 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Vinn, Vinn-bar.

00:37:07.292 --> 00:37:08.126 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Okay.

00:37:08.126 --> 00:37:08.694 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's good [laughing].

00:37:08.694 --> 00:37:09.961 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Alright.

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:13.398 align:middle line:84%
He's, he'd like his posh
name, but he mostly got, like.

00:37:13.398 --> 00:37:15.867 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Vinny was what they used
to call him before we got him.

00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:17.035 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Okay, okay.

00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:19.338 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So he's saying
another one that you have

00:37:19.338 --> 00:37:21.039 align:middle line:90%
that was his partner in life.

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:21.873 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:37:21.873 --> 00:37:22.407 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Is it a boy/girl thing?

00:37:22.407 --> 00:37:23.275 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:37:23.275 --> 00:37:24.676 align:middle line:84%
It's Angel, it's
a little Bichon.

00:37:24.676 --> 00:37:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Okay, yeah.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.878 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And, and she was lonely.

00:37:26.878 --> 00:37:30.248 align:middle line:84%
She was, after he died, she
would lie around on the floor,

00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:34.119 align:middle line:84%
you know, with her little chin
down and really was, she was,

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:35.787 align:middle line:84%
she was a little
depressed, I think.

00:37:35.787 --> 00:37:38.924 align:middle line:84%
And when this little one
came along, she was resentful

00:37:38.924 --> 00:37:40.859 align:middle line:84%
at first, and now
they're very close.

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:44.396 align:middle line:84%
They cuddle up, they play, they
chew on each other, but I, I do,

00:37:44.396 --> 00:37:46.698 align:middle line:90%
I, it didn't surprise me to know

00:37:46.698 --> 00:37:49.835 align:middle line:84%
that Vinn-Bar would have
handpicked this little dog,

00:37:49.835 --> 00:37:52.971 align:middle line:84%
which, who's name his
Earnest, or Ernie [laughter].

00:37:52.971 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Well, Vinn-bar was
a very intelligent dog.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.274 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:56.842 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah, very, very smart.

00:37:56.842 --> 00:37:57.642 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Old soul.

00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.246 align:middle line:84%
And you actually had,
you'd had that one

00:38:01.246 --> 00:38:03.315 align:middle line:84%
when you were very
young, a family dog.

00:38:03.315 --> 00:38:04.349 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Oh, I guess
that could have been.

00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Yeah, it was
the same one.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.351 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:38:06.351 --> 00:38:07.486 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Same, same traits.

00:38:07.486 --> 00:38:08.887 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they look the same.

00:38:08.887 --> 00:38:10.155 align:middle line:90%
He didn't look the same.

00:38:10.155 --> 00:38:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: He, he had the same
coloring as my first dog,

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.825 align:middle line:90%
in life when I was five.

00:38:13.825 --> 00:38:14.526 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Okay.

00:38:14.526 --> 00:38:15.761 align:middle line:90%
So that's the same one.

00:38:15.761 --> 00:38:17.729 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they do come back
and then, but this case,

00:38:17.729 --> 00:38:19.464 align:middle line:84%
the one that he sent,
that's a different soul.

00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:21.833 align:middle line:84%
He's still up there
watching over.

00:38:21.833 --> 00:38:24.069 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they'll
arrange for another one.

00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:25.937 align:middle line:84%
It's like they've
gone and they say oh,

00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:31.209 align:middle line:84%
I need to replace
whatever role I had.

00:38:31.209 --> 00:38:33.745 align:middle line:90%
So, Angel is more your,

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:36.782 align:middle line:84%
your sweetheart, the
healing one, and.

00:38:36.782 --> 00:38:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: She is.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.519 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And then the new one that
you got is, is more for fun.

00:38:40.519 --> 00:38:42.888 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. He, he needs
a lot of attention.

00:38:42.888 --> 00:38:43.955 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: He is.

00:38:43.955 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:84%
He likes to play, he
likes to walk a lot.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:46.792 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a lot of that.

00:38:46.792 --> 00:38:50.962 align:middle line:84%
And, and the, the, Angel,
the little healing dog.

00:38:50.962 --> 00:38:53.532 align:middle line:84%
She also sees things
and you talk about this,

00:38:53.532 --> 00:38:57.402 align:middle line:84%
dogs who see invisible
entities and such.

00:38:57.402 --> 00:39:00.305 align:middle line:84%
And she, she can, she'll go in
this special place in the house

00:39:00.305 --> 00:39:02.541 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of meditation
happens and she'll be looking up

00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:05.911 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes even let out
a little bark or a growl

00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:07.913 align:middle line:84%
at something, so let's talk
about what they're seeing,

00:39:07.913 --> 00:39:09.381 align:middle line:90%
they're invisible friends.

00:39:09.381 --> 00:39:11.416 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Well they're
much closer than we are.

00:39:11.416 --> 00:39:14.119 align:middle line:84%
They can go over to the other
side, they can see things.

00:39:14.119 --> 00:39:15.954 align:middle line:84%
So they, when they're
friends pass away,

00:39:15.954 --> 00:39:18.223 align:middle line:84%
they can get a little
depressed, but they know

00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:19.758 align:middle line:90%
that they're still around them.

00:39:19.758 --> 00:39:21.393 align:middle line:84%
So they don't take
it as hard as we do.

00:39:21.393 --> 00:39:24.696 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was the
thing that really helped me

00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:26.598 align:middle line:84%
when I started the
animal communication,

00:39:26.598 --> 00:39:29.000 align:middle line:84%
because I've lost animals
and it's so upsetting.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.368 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Very upsetting.

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:32.637 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: But when you start to
realize that they don't go away,

00:39:32.637 --> 00:39:35.273 align:middle line:84%
they stay around you, so
when you lose an animal,

00:39:35.273 --> 00:39:36.341 align:middle line:90%
they're, they're still around.

00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:37.375 align:middle line:90%
They're your partner forever,

00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:40.312 align:middle line:84%
and they will often
come back in life.

00:39:40.312 --> 00:39:42.914 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, they might, you
know, I say don't go looking

00:39:42.914 --> 00:39:44.749 align:middle line:84%
for them, but they'll,
they'll find a way to show up

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:46.952 align:middle line:84%
and you'll know when,
when you found.

00:39:46.952 --> 00:39:47.719 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:48.854 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: They will show up.

00:39:48.854 --> 00:39:50.222 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I had that happen
before between two dogs

00:39:50.222 --> 00:39:53.658 align:middle line:84%
that quickly incarnated into
another, into another lifetime

00:39:53.658 --> 00:39:56.094 align:middle line:84%
with me and she even
answered to the old name.

00:39:56.094 --> 00:39:56.595 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Really?

00:39:56.595 --> 00:39:57.629 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:57.629 --> 00:39:58.463 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Oh yeah, it
was a very literal,

00:39:58.463 --> 00:40:00.765 align:middle line:90%
all the same characteristics.

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:04.269 align:middle line:84%
What about following people
from lifetime to lifetime.

00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:07.839 align:middle line:84%
Do we have reincarnation
patterns with our animals?

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:08.773 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Oh, I believe so.

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:10.141 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:12.878 align:middle line:84%
Like the, the ancient healing
cats, they come back, yeah.

00:40:12.878 --> 00:40:15.447 align:middle line:84%
They're, they're owner was
probably somebody in Egypt

00:40:15.447 --> 00:40:17.082 align:middle line:84%
that they were with,
but, you know,

00:40:17.082 --> 00:40:18.083 align:middle line:90%
the more I've done this work,

00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:20.118 align:middle line:84%
the more I do believe
in past lives.

00:40:20.118 --> 00:40:23.088 align:middle line:84%
I think at first I wasn't really
sure whether we were like a drop

00:40:23.088 --> 00:40:26.124 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in an ocean
that mixes together, but now,

00:40:26.124 --> 00:40:30.729 align:middle line:84%
I really feel like our, our soul
stays as one and we come back

00:40:30.729 --> 00:40:35.033 align:middle line:84%
and we do have lifetime to
lifetime, different experiences,

00:40:35.033 --> 00:40:37.536 align:middle line:84%
and there are animals are
our partners and they come

00:40:37.536 --> 00:40:39.437 align:middle line:84%
with us through,
through every lifetime.

00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:40.505 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:40:40.505 --> 00:40:41.373 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that's very
comforting to a lot

00:40:41.373 --> 00:40:43.208 align:middle line:90%
of people listening to this.

00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:46.111 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how,
the how to part of this.

00:40:46.111 --> 00:40:49.481 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot of people
think oh yeah, easy for her,

00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:51.182 align:middle line:84%
she's been doing it since
she was a little kid,

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:53.552 align:middle line:84%
but like you said, you didn't
think you were doing anything

00:40:53.552 --> 00:40:55.387 align:middle line:84%
at all and you thought
you were making it up.

00:40:55.387 --> 00:41:00.325 align:middle line:84%
So, as anybody can do this,
let's talk about what some

00:41:00.325 --> 00:41:04.029 align:middle line:84%
of the basic rules of thumb
are in the how-to portion

00:41:04.029 --> 00:41:05.497 align:middle line:90%
of connecting with your animals.

00:41:05.497 --> 00:41:06.898 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Okay.

00:41:06.898 --> 00:41:09.034 align:middle line:84%
Well a big part of it is really
taking the time to get quiet.

00:41:09.034 --> 00:41:11.436 align:middle line:84%
You can't be running around
doing the shopping, coming in

00:41:11.436 --> 00:41:14.105 align:middle line:84%
and oh yeah, I want
to talk to the dog.

00:41:14.105 --> 00:41:16.608 align:middle line:84%
You have to kind of get
quiet and meditative.

00:41:16.608 --> 00:41:19.477 align:middle line:84%
And you're not talking to the
actual, you're not talking

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:23.715 align:middle line:84%
to a dog like hey, can you, you
know, bring the remote control.

00:41:23.715 --> 00:41:26.484 align:middle line:84%
I've had clients say well,
he's not looking at you,

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:28.520 align:middle line:90%
he's busy sniffing around.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.622 align:middle line:84%
They don't, it's not
the actual physical dog,

00:41:30.622 --> 00:41:32.257 align:middle line:90%
there's like two parts.

00:41:32.257 --> 00:41:34.359 align:middle line:84%
You're talking to their
higher consciousness.

00:41:34.359 --> 00:41:38.296 align:middle line:84%
It's like they can tap into the
higher consciousness much more

00:41:38.296 --> 00:41:39.431 align:middle line:90%
easily than we can.

00:41:39.431 --> 00:41:41.199 align:middle line:84%
We can do it as well,
but it's more difficult

00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:42.767 align:middle line:90%
for us, whereas they can.

00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:46.304 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking to their higher
self that is very intelligent

00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:49.074 align:middle line:84%
that now, you know what
their illnesses are,

00:41:49.074 --> 00:41:51.810 align:middle line:84%
what their issues
are, you know, that,

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.079 align:middle line:90%
that knows what our future is.

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:56.781 align:middle line:90%
That's much more adapted.

00:41:56.781 --> 00:42:00.218 align:middle line:84%
So, first you get quiet,
you go in yourself,

00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:03.788 align:middle line:84%
and I do like a breathing
technique and I say,

00:42:03.788 --> 00:42:05.590 align:middle line:84%
the easiest thing to
do is actually do it

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:08.093 align:middle line:84%
with somebody else's
animal and through a photo.

00:42:08.093 --> 00:42:10.195 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're doing
it with your own animal,

00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:12.297 align:middle line:84%
you're constantly double
guess, well I would have

00:42:12.297 --> 00:42:13.665 align:middle line:90%
that I would of said that.

00:42:13.665 --> 00:42:15.166 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Right, there's
too much information.

00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:16.935 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you do an
animal reading you don't

00:42:16.935 --> 00:42:18.570 align:middle line:90%
like any information beforehand.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:19.871 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah.

00:42:19.871 --> 00:42:21.072 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't, you know,
you can't double check it.

00:42:21.072 --> 00:42:23.541 align:middle line:84%
So in my workshops, I have
people read photographs

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.744 align:middle line:84%
and they, they share
photographs with other people

00:42:25.744 --> 00:42:27.579 align:middle line:84%
so that the owner's
there can tell them

00:42:27.579 --> 00:42:29.114 align:middle line:90%
if they're correct or not.

00:42:29.114 --> 00:42:33.018 align:middle line:84%
But it's easier to do it with
another animal, and I have them,

00:42:33.018 --> 00:42:37.389 align:middle line:84%
we do some exercises to
allow them to pretend and,

00:42:37.389 --> 00:42:40.825 align:middle line:84%
and that's very important, like
you said, that they don't feel

00:42:40.825 --> 00:42:42.861 align:middle line:84%
like oh I have, I have
to do this special thing,

00:42:42.861 --> 00:42:44.696 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get in
this special zone.

00:42:44.696 --> 00:42:47.132 align:middle line:84%
Just, first of all, allow
yourself to pretend,

00:42:47.132 --> 00:42:50.902 align:middle line:84%
because the way it works
is, it's like a packet

00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:53.805 align:middle line:84%
of information comes
to you, like a memory.

00:42:53.805 --> 00:42:56.508 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance,
if I said to you,

00:42:56.508 --> 00:42:58.143 align:middle line:84%
what did you do last
Valentine's?

00:42:58.143 --> 00:43:00.745 align:middle line:84%
You go back in your
memory and think about it

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:03.748 align:middle line:90%
and then you can share with me,

00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:06.818 align:middle line:84%
but you can only say
what you experienced,

00:43:06.818 --> 00:43:09.187 align:middle line:84%
try to express it,
but I can't feel it.

00:43:09.187 --> 00:43:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Right? But what you have in
your mind, you remember it,

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:14.592 align:middle line:84%
you remember the smells,
what you had for dinner,

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:18.496 align:middle line:84%
you remember the feeling, you
remember everything about it.

00:43:18.496 --> 00:43:20.465 align:middle line:84%
When you communicate
telepathically,

00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:23.501 align:middle line:84%
which is what this is,
they're passing you a packet

00:43:23.501 --> 00:43:24.869 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:43:24.869 --> 00:43:27.572 align:middle line:84%
So if you say, you know, what's
your favorite thing to do

00:43:27.572 --> 00:43:30.508 align:middle line:84%
and they're favorite thing is
running on the beach with dad,

00:43:30.508 --> 00:43:33.078 align:middle line:84%
they're sending you
that like it's a memory.

00:43:33.078 --> 00:43:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they're sending, you
know, the smell of the sea

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.184 align:middle line:84%
and the running around
and what it feels like.

00:43:39.184 --> 00:43:42.187 align:middle line:84%
And so, we just have a hard
time picking up on everything,

00:43:42.187 --> 00:43:43.354 align:middle line:84%
so we might pick
up on a little bit,

00:43:43.354 --> 00:43:46.391 align:middle line:84%
we might just sense the
smell of the seaside

00:43:46.391 --> 00:43:48.893 align:middle line:84%
or we might get a little bit
of a visual, you'd be very,

00:43:48.893 --> 00:43:50.795 align:middle line:84%
very good if you could
pick up everything.

00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:53.331 align:middle line:84%
But they can easily send us
that packet and we have to try

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:55.300 align:middle line:90%
to get back what we can.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.037 align:middle line:84%
I ask the animals to try to
send something a little unusual.

00:43:59.037 --> 00:44:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, if you say
well what's your favorite treat,

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.842 align:middle line:90%
and they say well it's a bone,

00:44:03.842 --> 00:44:06.277 align:middle line:84%
then I could have
guessed that, right?

00:44:06.277 --> 00:44:08.747 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I had a
funny little experience

00:44:08.747 --> 00:44:11.950 align:middle line:84%
where I just started
doing this and I went to,

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:13.618 align:middle line:84%
my daughter took me
to a fancy dinner

00:44:13.618 --> 00:44:16.254 align:middle line:84%
to meet her new boyfriend's
parents

00:44:16.254 --> 00:44:19.491 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know why she said
this, but at dinner she said,

00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:21.793 align:middle line:84%
oh, my mom's an animal
communicator.

00:44:21.793 --> 00:44:24.529 align:middle line:84%
So they were all like oh, great,
well tell me about my dog.

00:44:24.529 --> 00:44:26.831 align:middle line:84%
And so the lady gave
me a picture of her dog

00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:29.367 align:middle line:84%
and I said okay, what's
your favorite treat,

00:44:29.367 --> 00:44:31.369 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking that's
pretty easy right?

00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:37.041 align:middle line:84%
And the dog said mmm,
sweaty socks [laughter].

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:41.913 align:middle line:84%
So, if they say something
unusual that you know.

00:44:41.913 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Was that correct?

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.181 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Oh yeah.

00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:44.582 align:middle line:90%
Apparently it used to go

00:44:44.582 --> 00:44:46.284 align:middle line:84%
in her laundry basket
and take out socks.

00:44:46.284 --> 00:44:47.385 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: All the sweaty socks.

00:44:47.385 --> 00:44:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And she'd find
them in his dog bed.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well let's take a look
now, you read another little dog

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.759 align:middle line:84%
who was a puppy and it was
a different kind of reading

00:44:54.759 --> 00:44:57.028 align:middle line:84%
and interesting and we'll
talk about why afterwards,

00:44:57.028 --> 00:45:00.431 align:middle line:90%
so let's go to Kelly and Daisy.

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:03.802 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: So Kelly, this
one's just beautiful.

00:45:03.802 --> 00:45:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was wishing you
hadn't told me her name,

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.372 align:middle line:90%
but I did hear the name Daisy.

00:45:07.372 --> 00:45:08.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Yes.

00:45:08.306 --> 00:45:09.607 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And she is
just a love bug.

00:45:09.607 --> 00:45:11.743 align:middle line:84%
She has a purpose in life
and her purpose is just

00:45:11.743 --> 00:45:13.878 align:middle line:84%
to bring happiness and
love to the family.

00:45:13.878 --> 00:45:16.915 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a teenager at home?

00:45:16.915 --> 00:45:18.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: I don't.

00:45:18.183 --> 00:45:20.351 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Okay, because I see
her helping out somebody,

00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's a young
person, so I don't know

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.791 align:middle line:84%
if you've got a youngster
around the house.

00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:30.128 align:middle line:84%
She just is finding her
way around right now.

00:45:30.128 --> 00:45:34.532 align:middle line:84%
And so she, she likes to
know what the schedule is.

00:45:34.532 --> 00:45:37.836 align:middle line:84%
Actually, she can tell time,
which sounds kind of crazy.

00:45:37.836 --> 00:45:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Yeah.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Your schedule is,
is pretty much the same,

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.108 align:middle line:90%
but it is, are you married?

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Is your husband?

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: No.

00:45:46.044 --> 00:45:47.912 align:middle line:90%
It's just, just me and Daisy.

00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:48.613 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Okay, she's.

00:45:48.613 --> 00:45:49.781 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: At the house.

00:45:49.781 --> 00:45:51.015 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Cause she's saying
somebody else is not

00:45:51.015 --> 00:45:53.651 align:middle line:84%
as scheduled and she
doesn't know what's going on,

00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:54.652 align:middle line:90%
so I don't know who that is.

00:45:54.652 --> 00:45:56.254 align:middle line:90%
Did you just get her?

00:45:56.254 --> 00:45:57.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: I just got her.

00:45:57.255 --> 00:45:58.690 align:middle line:90%
I've had her for three weeks.

00:45:58.690 --> 00:45:59.624 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Okay, so she
might be telling me

00:45:59.624 --> 00:46:00.992 align:middle line:90%
about the other ones too.

00:46:00.992 --> 00:46:02.961 align:middle line:84%
But she likes to
know what's going on.

00:46:02.961 --> 00:46:05.129 align:middle line:84%
She likes to know what time
it is, when you're going.

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:08.099 align:middle line:84%
She gets a little bit
frantic when you leave her,

00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:10.802 align:middle line:84%
and partly that is you
worry about leaving her.

00:46:10.802 --> 00:46:11.569 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:12.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Yes.

00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:13.505 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah.

00:46:13.505 --> 00:46:15.206 align:middle line:84%
So when you will get concerned
about leaving her and she kind

00:46:15.206 --> 00:46:18.176 align:middle line:90%
of plays up on that for you.

00:46:18.176 --> 00:46:22.113 align:middle line:84%
[Pause] She's, she's having
a little issue with learning

00:46:22.113 --> 00:46:23.615 align:middle line:90%
to stop chewing things.

00:46:23.615 --> 00:46:24.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Yes.

00:46:24.249 --> 00:46:25.049 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Right now.

00:46:25.049 --> 00:46:26.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: She's very mouthy.

00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:27.886 align:middle line:84%
Today I brought the toys
and the treats and things.

00:46:27.886 --> 00:46:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.355 align:middle line:90%
So she gets going, she really.

00:46:30.355 --> 00:46:32.857 align:middle line:84%
She's saying I'm trying,
but it's difficult.

00:46:32.857 --> 00:46:35.593 align:middle line:84%
And she says she's very
proud that she's going

00:46:35.593 --> 00:46:37.161 align:middle line:90%
to proper training classes.

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:38.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Oh, good.

00:46:38.396 --> 00:46:39.964 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: She says that
she's, she's number two,

00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:43.568 align:middle line:84%
so did you have another
one like this before?

00:46:43.568 --> 00:46:45.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a bigger dog in spirit.

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:46.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Yes, I had, yes.

00:46:46.604 --> 00:46:48.039 align:middle line:90%
I had a Leonberger.

00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:49.774 align:middle line:90%
And was that a, a boy?

00:46:49.774 --> 00:46:51.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: A female.

00:46:51.009 --> 00:46:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Oh okay, because I'm
getting, I'm getting one

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:53.878 align:middle line:90%
in the spirit around

00:46:53.878 --> 00:46:56.014 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you'll actually
see her looking around

00:46:56.014 --> 00:46:57.348 align:middle line:90%
and playing around,

00:46:57.348 --> 00:47:02.554 align:middle line:84%
and so you're other one is
actually training her in spirit.

00:47:02.554 --> 00:47:04.789 align:middle line:90%
And also, is your mom around?

00:47:04.789 --> 00:47:05.356 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Yeah.

00:47:05.356 --> 00:47:06.357 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Okay, so.

00:47:06.357 --> 00:47:07.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly: But not
nearby, but she's,

00:47:07.492 --> 00:47:09.961 align:middle line:84%
yeah she's very excited
about daisy.

00:47:09.961 --> 00:47:11.229 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:11.229 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I, I think she's going to
be spending time with her

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.099 align:middle line:84%
and also your mom's mom
in spirit is around her

00:47:15.099 --> 00:47:16.801 align:middle line:90%
and she sees her a lot, so.

00:47:16.801 --> 00:47:18.636 align:middle line:90%
Did you have any questions?

00:47:18.636 --> 00:47:20.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Oh gosh.

00:47:21.472 --> 00:47:24.609 align:middle line:84%
[Pause] Gosh, I mean,
just if she's happy and.

00:47:24.609 --> 00:47:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Oh, she's thrilled.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.611 align:middle line:90%
She's thrilled.

00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:28.112 align:middle line:84%
You know, there, there our
partners in life, they,

00:47:28.112 --> 00:47:32.583 align:middle line:84%
they know a lot more than we do,
so she knows what's going on.

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:34.986 align:middle line:84%
She actually watches you when
you're on the computer and she,

00:47:34.986 --> 00:47:36.587 align:middle line:90%
sometimes you get a good idea

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:39.757 align:middle line:84%
and she says actually sometimes
it's her helping you out,

00:47:39.757 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:84%
so [laughing], yeah, she's
here to do a lot with you.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Kelly: Well good.

00:47:43.728 --> 00:47:44.762 align:middle line:90%
Well good.

00:47:44.762 --> 00:47:47.966 align:middle line:84%
She's a joyful little
spirit, so.

00:47:47.966 --> 00:47:49.567 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What a cute little puppy.

00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:50.702 align:middle line:90%
What a sweet dog.

00:47:50.702 --> 00:47:53.037 align:middle line:84%
I would have adopted
that one too.

00:47:53.037 --> 00:47:55.206 align:middle line:84%
And, and that one, when you
were talking with the animal

00:47:55.206 --> 00:47:58.242 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, you were
seeing other large dogs

00:47:58.242 --> 00:47:59.644 align:middle line:90%
and people around them.

00:47:59.644 --> 00:48:02.246 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what happens
there when she's saying well,

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:05.083 align:middle line:84%
no, no that's not,
that's not it.

00:48:05.083 --> 00:48:07.151 align:middle line:84%
What is going on and
what might we be seeing,

00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:10.421 align:middle line:84%
and we can't be dissuaded just
because there is something

00:48:10.421 --> 00:48:13.825 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing that is not
being validated by the owner.

00:48:13.825 --> 00:48:15.126 align:middle line:90%
What could be going on there?

00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:16.594 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And that is the
most difficult thing.

00:48:16.594 --> 00:48:18.663 align:middle line:84%
And, and when I teach
this to my students,

00:48:18.663 --> 00:48:21.399 align:middle line:84%
I say if somebody says,
no, don't worry about it,

00:48:21.399 --> 00:48:23.234 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes they'll come
back and say and oh, you know,

00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:26.371 align:middle line:84%
I checked with my mom or
checked with this and, and,

00:48:26.371 --> 00:48:28.873 align:middle line:84%
and that is the answer, but I
think, maybe, with that one,

00:48:28.873 --> 00:48:30.375 align:middle line:84%
I was picking up
the former owner,

00:48:30.375 --> 00:48:31.776 align:middle line:84%
I don't think she'd
had it that long.

00:48:31.776 --> 00:48:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's what
I was getting,

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:35.580 align:middle line:84%
is that because she had
just gotten that dog.

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.882 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And I felt that dog
was just very brand new,

00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:41.786 align:middle line:84%
learning its way around, trying
it's best to be really good,

00:48:41.786 --> 00:48:43.688 align:middle line:84%
really excited it
was being trained,

00:48:43.688 --> 00:48:46.324 align:middle line:84%
and that there was another dog
in spirit that was actually,

00:48:46.324 --> 00:48:49.160 align:middle line:84%
you know, watching it and
showing him the ropes,

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.829 align:middle line:84%
but he was very brand new
and wanted to do a good job.

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:53.231 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:54.665 align:middle line:84%
And the people, the other people
that was in, that may have been

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:57.702 align:middle line:84%
in that dog life's
prior to the adoption.

00:48:57.702 --> 00:48:59.504 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, and
that's interesting,

00:48:59.504 --> 00:49:04.609 align:middle line:84%
it's a really difficult thing on
an ego-ic level, to do a reading

00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:06.611 align:middle line:84%
and then have someone
say mmm, nope.

00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:07.845 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:10.715 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Yeah, that's the
worst thing, but, you know,

00:49:10.715 --> 00:49:12.383 align:middle line:90%
I've learned over time that,

00:49:12.383 --> 00:49:14.185 align:middle line:84%
that those people
will usually come back

00:49:14.185 --> 00:49:16.688 align:middle line:84%
and I get it sometimes while
I do a live stage thing

00:49:16.688 --> 00:49:19.757 align:middle line:84%
and they might say, you
know, this one over one,

00:49:19.757 --> 00:49:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell them, I'll
say, don't recognize that.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.629 align:middle line:84%
And then the person next to them
will come up and they will say

00:49:24.629 --> 00:49:27.398 align:middle line:84%
that was totally my dad
and he did say that.

00:49:27.398 --> 00:49:28.499 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, you know,

00:49:28.499 --> 00:49:31.102 align:middle line:84%
you could have put your
hand up [laughter].

00:49:31.102 --> 00:49:32.236 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Helped you
out a little bit.

00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:33.871 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: I have a funny
little story of that

00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:37.208 align:middle line:84%
when I first started and
I was doing readings,

00:49:37.208 --> 00:49:42.647 align:middle line:84%
and I had this lady came to me
with a girlfriend, and she's,

00:49:42.647 --> 00:49:46.217 align:middle line:84%
I started off by doing
mediumship and I said okay,

00:49:46.217 --> 00:49:50.154 align:middle line:84%
I have this person and I
described them and she said,

00:49:50.154 --> 00:49:52.957 align:middle line:84%
okay, now I have this
person and describe them,

00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and I thought I'm
getting nowhere.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.461 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:49:56.461 --> 00:49:58.129 align:middle line:90%
My, my guides left me.

00:49:58.129 --> 00:49:59.664 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is terrible!

00:49:59.664 --> 00:50:00.998 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
do the tarot cards,

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:02.400 align:middle line:90%
because that's, that's easier.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.069 align:middle line:84%
Tarot cards are easier because
they're about day-to-day things.

00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:08.106 align:middle line:84%
So I do the tarot cards and
I said okay, it's showing me

00:50:08.106 --> 00:50:12.043 align:middle line:84%
at work that the
clients are wonderful,

00:50:12.043 --> 00:50:14.479 align:middle line:84%
it's all the behind the scenes
stuff you don't really like,

00:50:14.479 --> 00:50:16.981 align:middle line:84%
but, you know, when you're,
when you're with the clients,

00:50:16.981 --> 00:50:20.184 align:middle line:84%
one-on-one, they never
complain about anything.

00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:22.453 align:middle line:84%
And these girls started
cracking up laughing.

00:50:22.453 --> 00:50:24.689 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
they were laughing at.

00:50:24.689 --> 00:50:26.457 align:middle line:84%
So we go on and I say okay,
let me have another go

00:50:26.457 --> 00:50:28.493 align:middle line:84%
at the mediumship, because
I'm getting this woman again,

00:50:28.493 --> 00:50:30.995 align:middle line:84%
this Margaret, and she's
telling me that she was a client

00:50:30.995 --> 00:50:33.898 align:middle line:84%
of yours recently and she's
showing me, I'm laid down,

00:50:33.898 --> 00:50:36.134 align:middle line:84%
I'm laid down, and it
was like this thin bed

00:50:36.134 --> 00:50:38.102 align:middle line:90%
and I said is it beautician?

00:50:38.102 --> 00:50:39.737 align:middle line:90%
They said well sort of?

00:50:39.737 --> 00:50:41.439 align:middle line:90%
Is it medical?

00:50:41.439 --> 00:50:44.242 align:middle line:90%
Sort of. What could it be?

00:50:44.242 --> 00:50:48.012 align:middle line:84%
And, and then this lady said oh,
now I know what you're doing.

00:50:48.012 --> 00:50:49.213 align:middle line:90%
They were morticians.

00:50:49.213 --> 00:50:52.650 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] And so I was
picking up on her clients

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:53.885 align:middle line:90%
that were coming through.

00:50:53.885 --> 00:50:57.555 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was
completely getting it all wrong.

00:50:57.555 --> 00:50:59.991 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's interesting
and I heard other situations,

00:50:59.991 --> 00:51:02.326 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who was
a very, very good medium

00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:05.296 align:middle line:84%
and the first time
she was reading for,

00:51:05.296 --> 00:51:07.665 align:middle line:84%
she didn't really want to do
this, but her husband pushed her

00:51:07.665 --> 00:51:10.868 align:middle line:84%
out there and her first
public gig, which was just

00:51:10.868 --> 00:51:13.070 align:middle line:84%
after they discovered
her abilities,

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.840 align:middle line:84%
was to a group of
other psychics.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.109 align:middle line:84%
And so this was a
tough audience.

00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:21.145 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
they asked, you know,

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:23.414 align:middle line:90%
they'd say well, no not really.

00:51:23.414 --> 00:51:24.515 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:51:24.515 --> 00:51:27.118 align:middle line:84%
And she was absolutely
mortified and left.

00:51:27.118 --> 00:51:29.987 align:middle line:84%
The woman who organized the,
the event was the publisher

00:51:29.987 --> 00:51:33.424 align:middle line:84%
of the Metaphysical Newspaper
in that city, and she came

00:51:33.424 --> 00:51:37.395 align:middle line:84%
up to her and said, do not
be discouraged, everything,

00:51:37.395 --> 00:51:39.330 align:middle line:90%
I know everyone of those people,

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:41.566 align:middle line:84%
everything you told
them is absolutely true,

00:51:41.566 --> 00:51:44.335 align:middle line:84%
they just weren't going to
give you that [laughter].

00:51:44.335 --> 00:51:46.904 align:middle line:84%
You know, and so, it,
it is, it is hard.

00:51:46.904 --> 00:51:48.105 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: It's also very
draining to actually tune

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.242 align:middle line:90%
into the other side and do that.

00:51:51.242 --> 00:51:53.211 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, like I said, I
used to do personal readings,

00:51:53.211 --> 00:51:55.379 align:middle line:84%
I don't do them anymore
because, to me,

00:51:55.379 --> 00:51:59.383 align:middle line:84%
it was like if I had somebody
and it came to me and I,

00:51:59.383 --> 00:52:01.586 align:middle line:84%
I communicated with
their loved one,

00:52:01.586 --> 00:52:04.655 align:middle line:84%
and they were very appreciative,
but it's like, you know,

00:52:04.655 --> 00:52:07.191 align:middle line:84%
there was, there was millions
of other people that would love

00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:11.495 align:middle line:84%
to see that, because it's
not, if I do it on stage,

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:15.233 align:middle line:84%
it's not just the person that
is receiving it, everybody else

00:52:15.233 --> 00:52:19.136 align:middle line:84%
in the audience going, oh, well,
now maybe there is an afterlife.

00:52:19.136 --> 00:52:19.804 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:52:19.804 --> 00:52:21.038 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:21.038 --> 00:52:22.473 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: And maybe I do sense
my dad when he's around

00:52:22.473 --> 00:52:26.277 align:middle line:84%
or I do sense my, you know, my
mom coming, and we do, we all,

00:52:26.277 --> 00:52:28.713 align:middle line:84%
we sense our loved ones,
and then we think oh no,

00:52:28.713 --> 00:52:30.581 align:middle line:90%
it's just my imagination.

00:52:30.581 --> 00:52:31.148 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't.

00:52:31.148 --> 00:52:32.450 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:34.352 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But you like working,
working in a larger scale,

00:52:34.352 --> 00:52:37.021 align:middle line:84%
right now, you, you're really
more into teaching than reading

00:52:37.021 --> 00:52:41.259 align:middle line:84%
and on that level, since
you do do work on stage

00:52:41.259 --> 00:52:48.432 align:middle line:84%
and you are still dialed in,
do you see any larger issues,

00:52:48.432 --> 00:52:52.370 align:middle line:84%
health issues, that are, seem
to be coming up more just

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:56.073 align:middle line:84%
as a preponderance of issues
coming up in a given area

00:52:56.073 --> 00:52:59.076 align:middle line:84%
over the last couple
of years, for example?

00:52:59.076 --> 00:53:01.178 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Well, you
know, I see a lot

00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:03.814 align:middle line:84%
of the same things
over and over.

00:53:03.814 --> 00:53:08.853 align:middle line:84%
And, to teach people, firstly to
look at the different triggers

00:53:08.853 --> 00:53:10.054 align:middle line:84%
and the things they're
holding onto,

00:53:10.054 --> 00:53:11.455 align:middle line:90%
because that's a lot of it.

00:53:11.455 --> 00:53:15.893 align:middle line:84%
So, I might say, you know, think
about your past relationships.

00:53:15.893 --> 00:53:18.496 align:middle line:84%
Think about your family
when you were younger.

00:53:18.496 --> 00:53:21.565 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking about an old
relationship, do you think oh,

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:25.002 align:middle line:84%
yeah, that guy, he did this and
he did that or do you think,

00:53:25.002 --> 00:53:28.172 align:middle line:84%
oh yeah, love and lie, you
know, I had that experience and,

00:53:28.172 --> 00:53:29.540 align:middle line:90%
you know, now I'm over it.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.742 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, we don't, you'd have
to be angel, you know, you,

00:53:31.742 --> 00:53:34.712 align:middle line:84%
you hold certain energies
that like oh, he said this,

00:53:34.712 --> 00:53:37.581 align:middle line:84%
he said that, and if you're
holding onto something years

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:39.317 align:middle line:84%
and years later,
something your dad said

00:53:39.317 --> 00:53:41.085 align:middle line:84%
or something your
mom didn't say,

00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:43.154 align:middle line:84%
it's like it's a
trigger, it's energy.

00:53:43.154 --> 00:53:46.524 align:middle line:84%
And, and I believed that the
energy is sawed around our body.

00:53:46.524 --> 00:53:50.361 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, if you leave
that long enough, and it's going

00:53:50.361 --> 00:53:52.496 align:middle line:84%
to get triggered over and over,
things are going to come up,

00:53:52.496 --> 00:53:55.566 align:middle line:84%
so it might be, you know, you've
had four or five relationships,

00:53:55.566 --> 00:53:58.002 align:middle line:84%
you keep meeting the same
guy, well why is that?

00:53:58.002 --> 00:54:00.871 align:middle line:84%
Because you haven't
completely released that energy

00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:03.374 align:middle line:84%
and it's coming, and it
can come closer and closer,

00:54:03.374 --> 00:54:05.409 align:middle line:84%
and where it is on your
body is going to be,

00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:07.945 align:middle line:90%
is going to affect what it is.

00:54:07.945 --> 00:54:10.314 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I see a lot
of people with extra weight

00:54:10.314 --> 00:54:13.784 align:middle line:84%
on their thighs and their hips,
and that's all family stuff,

00:54:13.784 --> 00:54:15.653 align:middle line:90%
that's the area of family.

00:54:15.653 --> 00:54:18.055 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, we'll,
I'll, I'll help them to,

00:54:18.055 --> 00:54:20.458 align:middle line:84%
to reset their energy,
but I'll also say you need

00:54:20.458 --> 00:54:23.627 align:middle line:84%
to your own work, you need to,
at night, you know, just put out

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:26.397 align:middle line:84%
and think to yourself what
happened when you were younger

00:54:26.397 --> 00:54:28.733 align:middle line:84%
and am I still holding onto
that, we don't need to hold

00:54:28.733 --> 00:54:31.302 align:middle line:84%
onto that anymore, that
it's not serving us.

00:54:31.302 --> 00:54:33.637 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, people can
diet and exercise all they want,

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:35.573 align:middle line:84%
if they've got the energy
there, they're going

00:54:35.573 --> 00:54:36.874 align:middle line:90%
to have the extra weight there.

00:54:36.874 --> 00:54:40.511 align:middle line:84%
You know, backache is
often financial stress,

00:54:40.511 --> 00:54:41.746 align:middle line:90%
taking on too much.

00:54:41.746 --> 00:54:43.114 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Are you seeing,
that's what I was wondering,

00:54:43.114 --> 00:54:46.317 align:middle line:84%
are you seeing more and more
lower back problems these days?

00:54:46.317 --> 00:54:49.387 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: A lot of, a lot of
people with financial stress.

00:54:49.387 --> 00:54:52.223 align:middle line:84%
And, and almost like when they
get in that spiral of, well,

00:54:52.223 --> 00:54:54.959 align:middle line:84%
I don't have enough and I can't
do this, and then it gets worse

00:54:54.959 --> 00:54:57.528 align:middle line:84%
and worse and we bring
more and more to us.

00:54:57.528 --> 00:54:59.864 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult
by yourself just

00:54:59.864 --> 00:55:02.767 align:middle line:84%
to say look I'm strong enough
just to get out of this.

00:55:02.767 --> 00:55:05.936 align:middle line:84%
If we are strong enough, we can
just sit there by ourselves,

00:55:05.936 --> 00:55:08.873 align:middle line:84%
connect in to divine source
or god or whatever you believe

00:55:08.873 --> 00:55:11.075 align:middle line:90%
and say, you know, help me,

00:55:11.075 --> 00:55:12.610 align:middle line:84%
because we ask help
everybody else,

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:15.012 align:middle line:84%
we forget to ask
ourselves, and say, you know,

00:55:15.012 --> 00:55:18.749 align:middle line:84%
help me to release,
because there are energies,

00:55:18.749 --> 00:55:20.618 align:middle line:84%
we do have spirits around
us that will open the doors

00:55:20.618 --> 00:55:24.622 align:middle line:84%
and show us and give us them
things that we need we don't ask

00:55:24.622 --> 00:55:27.825 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves, but if we,
we just believe and we ask

00:55:27.825 --> 00:55:31.996 align:middle line:84%
when we're open to receiving it,
then they're going to help us.

00:55:31.996 --> 00:55:33.631 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes you get so much.

00:55:33.631 --> 00:55:36.333 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have so
much, years and years of,

00:55:36.333 --> 00:55:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and then recently, one thing
after another, and it becomes,

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:40.971 align:middle line:84%
you know, a cloud and
energy around you,

00:55:40.971 --> 00:55:43.574 align:middle line:90%
it's more difficult to relieve.

00:55:43.574 --> 00:55:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What about some of, we
just have a couple minutes left,

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:49.246 align:middle line:84%
left, what about some of
the young kids coming in,

00:55:49.246 --> 00:55:50.781 align:middle line:84%
they seem to be wired
quite differently,

00:55:50.781 --> 00:55:52.917 align:middle line:84%
or what are you seeing
in little kids right now?

00:55:52.917 --> 00:55:55.886 align:middle line:84%
>> GT: Oh, I see a lot of little
kids that are very psychic.

00:55:55.886 --> 00:55:59.824 align:middle line:84%
I think it's more accepted these
days, and it has a lot to do

00:55:59.824 --> 00:56:01.859 align:middle line:84%
with their, their
parents, you know?

00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:03.961 align:middle line:84%
At our age, a lot of
us when we were young,

00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:05.563 align:middle line:84%
your parents would say, you
know, you're not allowed to see,

00:56:05.563 --> 00:56:07.765 align:middle line:84%
you can't see stuff like that,
you can't talk to animals,

00:56:07.765 --> 00:56:10.901 align:middle line:84%
you can't see things, whereas I
think now people are more open

00:56:10.901 --> 00:56:12.470 align:middle line:90%
and they encourage youngsters.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:15.206 align:middle line:84%
I actually get little ones
that come and learn how

00:56:15.206 --> 00:56:18.142 align:middle line:84%
to do reiki and, and I think
they're much more, well,

00:56:18.142 --> 00:56:19.743 align:middle line:84%
kids were much more
in tune in general,

00:56:19.743 --> 00:56:23.180 align:middle line:84%
but if we can just foster that
and allow them to do that.

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.516 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I was talking to someone
recently who said they thought

00:56:25.516 --> 00:56:30.254 align:middle line:84%
that with the arrival of the,
we have a more open energy,

00:56:30.254 --> 00:56:32.890 align:middle line:84%
like you say, that allows for
this to express itself in kids,

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:36.794 align:middle line:84%
but they were seeing that
the IQ's of humanity,

00:56:36.794 --> 00:56:38.329 align:middle line:90%
in general, would start leaping.

00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 2 and 300, 130, 140 is
considered a genius right now,

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.936 align:middle line:84%
that'll be stupid
[laughter] down the road.

00:56:45.936 --> 00:56:49.306 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, that whole aspect of
being lit up at an early age

00:56:49.306 --> 00:56:52.276 align:middle line:84%
and using it is really
important isn't it?

00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:53.544 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: Yeah.

00:56:53.544 --> 00:56:55.145 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming back as
a, as a more ancient soul,

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:57.381 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of ancient
souls coming in right now.

00:56:57.381 --> 00:56:58.782 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:02.319 align:middle line:84%
Well, how to talk to your pets,
you do wonderful work with dogs

00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:05.322 align:middle line:84%
and cats and also with human
beings, so don't call you

00:57:05.322 --> 00:57:07.758 align:middle line:84%
for a reading, but you have
plenty of books available

00:57:07.758 --> 00:57:09.326 align:middle line:84%
so people can dial in
and also you're going

00:57:09.326 --> 00:57:10.694 align:middle line:90%
to be doing a new TV show.

00:57:10.694 --> 00:57:11.362 align:middle line:90%
>> GT: I am!

00:57:11.362 --> 00:57:11.962 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:57:11.962 --> 00:57:12.463 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:57:12.463 --> 00:57:12.963 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:57:12.963 --> 00:57:14.064 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:14.064 --> 00:57:15.699 align:middle line:84%
Gail has been very busy
with a video series,

00:57:15.699 --> 00:57:19.270 align:middle line:84%
that video series is called Gail
Thackray's Spiritual Journey's

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:22.373 align:middle line:84%
which you can find on her
website at gailthackery.com,

00:57:22.373 --> 00:57:24.308 align:middle line:84%
though I think you're going to
be taking it to the airwaves.

00:57:24.308 --> 00:57:27.678 align:middle line:84%
You can also teach yourself how
to open your intuitive abilities

00:57:27.678 --> 00:57:30.714 align:middle line:84%
by consulting with one of
her books, also available

00:57:30.714 --> 00:57:32.516 align:middle line:90%
on her site and through Amazon.

00:57:32.516 --> 00:57:34.385 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you might
also enjoy my interview

00:57:34.385 --> 00:57:36.987 align:middle line:84%
with Linda Benner [phonetic],
who is also in deep resonance

00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:38.355 align:middle line:90%
with the animal kingdom.

00:57:38.355 --> 00:57:43.193 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
