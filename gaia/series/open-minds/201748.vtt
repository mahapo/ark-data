00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: The
television show "Vikings"

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle line:10%
brought about curiosity
among many to know more about

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:10%
the ancient culture.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.630 align:middle line:10%
What it didn't feature
was the deep mysticism.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.190 align:middle line:10%
Rather, brute force.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:10%
Survival and dominance were
the way of life depicted,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.020 align:middle line:10%
but there was a hidden
spiritual aspect

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:10%
of the Viking
culture that worked

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.660 align:middle line:10%
through runes, which we know
today as a divination tube.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Kaedrich Olsen is
with us to talk

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:84%
about the runes, the golden
shadow, and pagan masculinity

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:90%
via the Norse culture.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So I have to say,
looking at your rings,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
looking at your tattoos,
knowing your passion,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:84%
you've been in this
for a really long time.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:90%
I would have to--

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:84%
because we're at
Gaia, we can say this.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I would have to guess this
is something you've carried

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:90%
forward for many lifetimes.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.910 align:middle line:84%
You're very, very knowledgeable,
but completely ensconced

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:90%
in that Norse tradition.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>> KAEDRICH OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
It's been a part of who I
am probably for lifetimes.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I'm thinking.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
You brought this
through from the day.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So you might be
thinking-- you might

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.125 align:middle line:84%
be speaking to us from the
past with some great authority.

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm setting it up
that way because that's

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:90%
what I believe to be true.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Thank you.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So first of all,
let's talk about when you were

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.382 align:middle line:84%
a little kid, though, when this
stuff started poking through.

00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Because all of us that
have had lifetimes

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
in other spaces, other cultures,
with really deep interests,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:84%
it usually pokes its little head
up somewhere when we're little.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
you as a child

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and how you started developing
your fascination with runes

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.510 align:middle line:90%
and the Norse culture.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Yeah.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:10%
It was actually an interesting
step by step process.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:10%
In my parents' home
in the basement,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:10%
we had a library full of books.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.540 align:middle line:10%
Anything that you could possibly
want to read on, encyclopedias.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:10%
We had the old Gavin
and Yvonne Frost

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.672 align:middle line:10%
books on magic and witchcraft.

00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:10%
And then there was
my favorite book

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:10%
that I devoured as
a young teenager,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:10%
"Secret Teachings of all Ages."

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:10%
And I would pore through that.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that all of these
different mystical traditions

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
were saying the same
thing over and over.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
They were just using different
words and different terms.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.295 align:middle line:84%
And he had this interesting
little section in there

00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:21.980 align:middle line:84%
about the Odinic mysteries
that fascinated me.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And about that same time, I
got a hold of a book of runes.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I was listening to some pretty
crazy music at the time.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.392 align:middle line:90%
I still kind of do.

00:02:30.392 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
It kind of goes
with the territory.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.017 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Smoking crazy
stuff at the same time too?

00:02:34.017 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Nope.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.978 align:middle line:90%
I try to keep a clear head.

00:02:36.978 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:84%
But the music pointed
me in that direction,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.605 align:middle line:84%
and I came across a book, "The
Way of Wyrd," by Brian Bates.

00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The way of what?

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Wyrd.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:90%
W-Y-R-D, wyrd.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And properly pronounced
"vird," but that's OK.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to that another time.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And all of these three
things converged.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And, well, I tapped into it
and I started using the runes.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was like it clicked.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Just every little piece clicked.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And the more I dove into
it, the deeper the well

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
got, to the point where
I started studying

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:90%
the original languages.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I can stumble and bash my
way through old Norse poetry.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And I have the mystical mindset
from growing up with this way,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
working with the
different pagan groups.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But I've always been
focused on the Norse,

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and so I can translate the old
Norse with a mystical mindset

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:84%
to catch the things that some
of these great translators

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.517 align:middle line:84%
do miss, because they don't
have the mystical mindset.

00:03:24.517 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And I started applying
that through my life,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:84%
throughout my entire lifetime
teaching, leading groups,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.473 align:middle line:84%
doing rituals,
that sort of thing.

00:03:31.473 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You
also, I understand,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:84%
were having
experiences as a youth,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.030 align:middle line:84%
as well as what
you were studying.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Having paranormal experiences
and interfacing a little bit

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:90%
with the other realms.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that, because we're

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.230 align:middle line:84%
going to go there later
in the conversation.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And also how that interface
with or expressed itself

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.525 align:middle line:90%
in the Norse culture.

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the good
things about-- since we're here

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:84%
at Gaia, we can talk about
the wacky woo-woo stuff.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: I did live in a
house that was very haunted.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You could set something
down, turn around,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:90%
and it would be gone.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:84%
You would hear footsteps
walking down a hallway,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:84%
but not seeing anybody
in the hallway.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Upstairs, you would hear
the toilet flush downstairs.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It was all sorts of kind of
wonky little things going on.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:84%
But all the while, I had
what they call whispers now.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Little voices that would
say, hey, go look at this.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Hey, go do this.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:90%
How about you investigate this?

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.845 align:middle line:84%
And here's some
download of information

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:24.595 align:middle line:84%
that would just kind
of dump into my head.

00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:25.548 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what?

00:04:25.548 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And all the while, I'm
skeptical, mind you.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to take it as
face value, going, OK, yeah,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.952 align:middle line:90%
I'm super great and wonderful.

00:04:31.952 --> 00:04:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I've got these people
talking in my head.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
It was like, OK, I'm
making this stuff up.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:90%
This is just me.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But I'll write it down,
and they're like, OK.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:90%
We'll be patient with you.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:90%
We'll let you see.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.068 align:middle line:84%
And then out in the real world,
things would just play out

00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:90%
just like they said they would.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.393 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh.

00:04:47.393 --> 00:04:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And how old were
you when all these experiences

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:90%
began?

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.163 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Oh, I remember being
on a playground in elementary

00:04:53.163 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:90%
school and hearing it.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.575 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you were being
whispered to by the we folk,

00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:58.587 align:middle line:84%
or whomever, or your
higher guidance, yeah.

00:04:58.587 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Yeah, higher guidance.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
That is definitely,
absolutely one of those.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, I
realized one of those whispers

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
was my own higher self
interacting with me

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and taking a personal
interest in my own evolution

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.357 align:middle line:84%
But there've been a number of
voices throughout the years.

00:05:12.357 --> 00:05:14.232 align:middle line:84%
You know, wake up in
the middle of the night,

00:05:14.232 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:90%
hey, pick up your book.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Read this.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK, I'll read that.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
The next day, a
book will literally

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:84%
be dropped on my desk
expounding upon that one.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK, I get it.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And then over the
years, there would

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle line:84%
be these downloads
that would come

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:84%
in that may only be five
minutes as I'm taking a walk,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.050 align:middle line:90%
or meditating, or whatever.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But I would be at the
computer for hours

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
turning what this ball
of information they

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:90%
gave to me into a line.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But I had to set
a limit with them,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle line:84%
because I have hundreds
of pages of great theory

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:90%
that I'm like, great.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
What is the point
of this theory?

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Give me the practical
application.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's make this useful
for people in their lives

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:84%
so they can change their
lives, make themselves better.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Because this theory is
nonsense if you can't use it.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.615 align:middle line:84%
And for the past 10 years
or so, they've been saying,

00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:84%
here, here's these things that
you can learn to apply it.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Here are these things you
can learn to apply it.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.895 align:middle line:84%
Now, here in the
middle of night,

00:06:06.895 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
we're going to give you this
dream on doing some shadow

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.647 align:middle line:84%
clearing work, healing
soul wound work,

00:06:11.647 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and all of this kind of stuff
that keeps coming through.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, wow.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's put together a test
group and see if there's

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:90%
some validity to this.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I see it
and I'm, like, OK,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:84%
you guys are still spot
on after all these years.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Higher guidance usually is
if it's a clear communication

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:90%
path.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
As long as ego's not in
the way, it works, right?

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk about
the golden shadow and shadow

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:90%
work in a little bit.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.962 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do
is kind of dive into--

00:06:36.962 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:84%
so people-- let's say
some of our viewers

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:90%
have watched "Vikings."

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.517 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's brutal.

00:06:40.517 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:90%
I could only watch a few.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, but let
me just toss something in here,

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and I mentioned it
in another interview.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm a student of hermetics
and have been for many years.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And one kind of
block of knowledge

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:84%
that I was exposed to had
to do with Atlantean times

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and what happened as Atlantis,
as people both emigrated

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:84%
from Atlantis while it
was still intact, and also

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the calamities,
where they were forced

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:90%
to emigrate if they survived.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And it talked about some
of the people who had--

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
who were more seafaring, who had
made it over into Scandinavia

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and mated with the
indigenous Norse people

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
to create almost kind of a
super strain of individual

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:84%
that were quite strong, quite
hardy, larger in stature,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and became known as what
we call Vikings today.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how
that lands with you.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But you know more about the
mystical side of the culture.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's not look at the brute
side, but what that could mean.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Because if they did come from
Atlantean times in the north,

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
they, as the druids
did, then these people

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:84%
were imbued with great
amounts of not only esoteric,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:90%
but practical knowledge.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word Viking,
if we pronounce it

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:84%
in the old language, "vicking,"
means someone from the wick,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.352 align:middle line:90%
or a straight of water.

00:08:04.352 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: It was more of a part
time summer job that was just

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.427 align:middle line:84%
people who traveled,
rather than actual culture,

00:08:11.427 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:90%
or of an ethnicity, or anything.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.610 align:middle line:90%
It was just a job.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And when they first started
off, the Vikings went out

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and they mainly did
trading, some raiding,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:90%
that was part of it.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Trading and raiding.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Because they could.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Yeah, and
some colonization.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, though,
in the Norse tales,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
in the sagas of
themselves, the word Viking

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.882 align:middle line:84%
actually became a scoundrel,
a despot, like a pirate.

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is how
they're depicted today.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Right.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
They were pretty well lambasted
by the Norse people themselves.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And then somehow
in the modern time,

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.118 align:middle line:84%
we picked up the term Viking
and then romanticized it.

00:08:44.118 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll actually
attribute that probably

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:84%
to the early 20th century,
with the Wagnerians.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:84%
They kind of recovered that
one and they did some shifts.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But under the
surface of all that,

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:90%
because we see the brutality.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And in the weird case of the
Vikings, I will say for them,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.355 align:middle line:84%
history was written
by the sore losers.

00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Instead of
actually by themselves,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
had to play up, like, oh,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:90%
these big brutes came in and--

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So let's talk that.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
history of the sore losers.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Who lost?

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Sure.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.040 align:middle line:84%
In a temple, monastery, when
the Vikings raided on Easter

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.137 align:middle line:84%
Sunday, that sure,
they may not have

00:09:20.137 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:84%
been able to defend themselves,
because they were monks.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it was a full
on raid, absolutely.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But how are these monks
going to write back home

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.800 align:middle line:84%
to the main church
in Rome to say, hey,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.135 align:middle line:84%
these guys came in and
took all of our gold?

00:09:32.135 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:84%
They're going to write,
no, they were bloodthirsty.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.060 align:middle line:90%
They were vicious.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:90%
They were horrible and terrible.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
They came and killed and
destroyed everything.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.592 align:middle line:90%
And then the church will go, oh.

00:09:41.592 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a village I can't
quite remember the name of.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Even the Romans wrote
about how that these

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
were bloodthirsty, awful
people, creating weapons

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that they were very
warlike and terrible,

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.070 align:middle line:90%
and they need to be eradicated.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, they came through
and plowed down the village.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Recently, like, within
the past 10 years,

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:84%
archaeologists have
actually found that village

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and dug it up, and found
out that there was not

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.700 align:middle line:84%
a single sign of weapon
making whatsoever.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.225 align:middle line:84%
This was Roman propaganda
to take over the land.

00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, of course.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know that
part of history,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:90%
so that makes perfect sense.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
there's no denying

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that one can exploit
situation and try

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:90%
to loot a place a little bit.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But that's very different
than dominating and wiping out

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
a citizenry, for example, in
a bloodthirsty manner, which

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
is how it continues
to be depicted,

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.712 align:middle line:84%
but in a sexy,
more glamorous way.

00:10:31.712 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: There is no doubt
it was a violent culture,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
as were all cultures
at the time.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to
remember that was the case.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.695 align:middle line:84%
These were-- this
was tribal living.

00:10:40.695 --> 00:10:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And resources were
scarce, and they did have

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:90%
to shore up their resources.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.685 align:middle line:84%
The thing that they excelled
at, though, with their ships.

00:10:47.685 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Their ships took on
such a little water

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that they could go down
swiftly down the rivers

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and do their raids
real quick and back out

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.143 align:middle line:84%
before a lot of the
villagers knew what happened.

00:10:56.143 --> 00:10:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is kind
of what gave them

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:84%
the reputation of being so
violent, so bloodthirsty.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, if we
really look at it

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
from a historical
perspective, they

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
were no more than any
other culture at the time.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:90%
They just had better boats.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.682 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, the reason
I brought up that Atlantean

00:11:10.682 --> 00:11:13.160 align:middle line:84%
connection is because, A,
they had better technology.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And they may have had
some kind of stamina

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and physical prowess that
made it possible to do

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:90%
some of the feats they did.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.980 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's possible.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.977 align:middle line:84%
If you're taking blood from
another continent and mixing,

00:11:24.977 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:90%
this happens all the time.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Hybridized species.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
We're all hybridized to
one degree or another.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So they become-- it just takes
on a little more interest,

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.890 align:middle line:90%
especially hybridized knowledge.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where we get
into, when we look at the druids

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and we look at the nature of
the way the knowledge was passed

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.210 align:middle line:84%
on orally, and
through symbolism,

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.295 align:middle line:84%
the same thing with
the Norsemen, right?

00:11:44.295 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about the runic tradition,

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.625 align:middle line:84%
what runes initially were,
what they represented.

00:11:50.625 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Because no one
can read them now.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.792 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can go and
have a rune reading,

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't mean anything
for us looking at the runes.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:90%
But it means something to you.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.815 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:11:59.815 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And let me give
you three pathways

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:84%
for how the runes came into
being as we know them today.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Building off of the
hermetic tradition

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient tradition
that could be from Atlantis,

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:84%
the Norse lore
specifically tells us

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that the Aesir, the high gods
of the Norse, came from Asia,

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:90%
came from the Far East.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.760 align:middle line:84%
It's in there in a
few different places.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And along the way,
Odin, the high god,

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:90%
the chieftain of all the gods--

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Odin, as we say.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Right.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Odin, "othin."

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say things
a little bit funny.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just try to interpret
in case someone's thinking,

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.100 align:middle line:90%
"othin?"

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.267 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard of "othin."

00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle line:90%
But you've heard of Odin.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Odin, yes.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:84%
He was the high
god of the Aesir.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And the lore tells
us he traveled

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:84%
throughout many
different lands, teaching

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:84%
his wisdom to these
many different cultures.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And they call him
by various names,

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:84%
by the name that they
understood him to be.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And people who now
study languages

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
understand that there was an
old proto Indo-European language

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that was shared by
the Norse people

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.120 align:middle line:90%
and shared by the Vedic people.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And most likely, the Aesir, who
came to the Norse from Asia,

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:84%
were actually the Asuras from
the Vedic tradition there,

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:90%
another type of deity.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:84%
They were the devas,
that were the high gods.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But the Asuras were a
bit more rebellious,

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
which the lore even talks
about the Aesir being

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:90%
rebellious to the old gods.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's even in there.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But as they came
through the lands,

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:84%
they taught and they did
so many different things.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And so he definitely
has this teaching.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And if we look to some of
these ancient Vedic teachings,

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
we find some of the words
of Vishnu being parroted

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
by Odin when he talks about
the greatest sacrifice of self

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:90%
to the self.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
That's in the Bhagavad Gita,
the sacrifice of self to self.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
The stuff that Odin
teaches the Norse we

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.830 align:middle line:84%
find in the hermetic tradition
through Thoth, Hermes,

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Trismegistus, and I've got
a good friend in Turkey

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
who shares with all of
these different overlaps

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:84%
from other cultures that are
in that area with the teachings

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:90%
of Odin.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So we see Odin as this
long lineage coming

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
from this other
culture, probably

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:90%
a very immortal person.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even still
being alive today,

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.275 align:middle line:90%
teaching people in this way.

00:14:06.275 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and I think it's
important for us to understand

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:84%
that, when you're looking at
the pantheon of gods in any

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
culture, these are usually the
very same entities that have

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
shown up repeatedly
throughout history globally.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:84%
A group of beings who
came to offer knowledge,

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
to offer guidance,
to offer protection,

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.320 align:middle line:90%
sometimes to provoke.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Indeed.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, you have the
whole pantheon of characters,

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so of course
they're showing up in the North

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
mythology under whatever
the name of the day is,

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:90%
but very similar.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:84%
It makes sense that you would
find the exact same teachings

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.725 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere historically.

00:14:42.725 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now what
about the runes themselves?

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Because that's your thing,
that's your specialty.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, among other
things, but yeah.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: And that
goes back to Odin.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:84%
In the mythological
tale of Odin,

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:84%
he hung himself upon the world
tree Yggdrasil for nine nights.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And in the shamanic
practice that he did,

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:84%
peered into the
depths to the abyss

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and were able to see the runes
that already were created.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And then with a roaring
cry, he gathered them up

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:90%
and fell back from the tree.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Some he gave to the high gods.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.705 align:middle line:84%
Some he gave to the
fertility gods, the Vanir.

00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Some he gave to the
giants, some to human,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:90%
some he kept for himself.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But what this tells us, and
specifically in that passage,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.180 align:middle line:84%
is that the runes existed before
he did, that the runes came

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:90%
from a time before time.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great little
thing in the old Norse,

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Ginnregen, that were shaped
by the high holy rulers,

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
the people who existed,
the gods before the gods,

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Fimbulthulr who were
colored by the great singer.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Fimbulthulr is the great singer.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:84%
A Thule, in the Norse tradition
is a lot like a cantor,

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.540 align:middle line:90%
sings the religious songs.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:84%
"Fimbul" means
"great" or "super."

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And that tells us not
only did the runes exist

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
in a time before time, that
they were subtle energies,

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
but that they were also
vibratory frequencies that

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:90%
connected with consciousness.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.455 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to gather them
and then teach these runes

00:16:08.455 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to the different
types of beings,

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:84%
including humans, in ways
that we best understood.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they're kind
of foundational symbols

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
representing them,
sound vibration.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Exactly.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: And we actually didn't
get the symbols until a tribe

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.580 align:middle line:84%
of the Goths from lower Sweden
were a mercenary troupe that

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.210 align:middle line:84%
went throughout Europe plying
their wares as mercenaries.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And they brought back with
them, in the Gothland,

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.002 align:middle line:84%
the writings of what I
believe to be the Estruscans.

00:16:39.002 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the Etruscan
alphabet looks

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:90%
a lot like the runic alphabet.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.873 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was just going
to ask you that, yeah, yeah.

00:16:43.873 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Yeah, and
the term Erliaz,

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
which is what they were,
actually shows up in the Bible.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:90%
They were the Heruli.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
They were one of
the Gothic tribes

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:84%
that were fighting against
the Roman Empire at the time.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And when they came back into
Scandinavia, around the year--

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
2000 years ago,
around 0 BC, they

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.270 align:middle line:90%
brought with them this writing.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:90%
And they taught it to people.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, if you were
to look on a rune stone,

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:84%
you would see a
term, "ek Erliaz," It

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:90%
means "I am the rune master."

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.690 align:middle line:84%
the Gothic tribe of
the Erliaz became

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.077 align:middle line:90%
known as the rune masters.

00:17:20.077 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones who
actually gave the runes

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:84%
their shape that
we see them today

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and their phonetic values
as we know them today,

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
pairing with the
wisdom of Odin, as he

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
brought their vibratory
energies at the numinous level

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:90%
into the physical level.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.410 align:middle line:84%
This gave the physical
form for the runes

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.020 align:middle line:90%
to exist in our reality.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do they at all
overlap with druidic symbols,

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.677 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:17:42.677 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Now the Druids--

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not really.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: --have the ogham,
which are all based off

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:46.750 align:middle line:90%
of the trees.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Trees.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.555 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, the alphabet of trees.

00:17:48.555 --> 00:17:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Right, and
they're different.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's
totally different.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.447 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Totally different.

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
only the Etruscan,

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
nothing to be found in other
hieroglyphics, for example,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:90%
in Egyptian times.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It's its own thing
you're saying.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Right, it could.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Could be, yeah.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: But for
the most part--

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: For the most
part, it's its own thing.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.562 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: --it's
its own thing, yeah.

00:18:04.562 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, OK, so now you
have been engaging with ruins.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Mm-hmm.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So is it the same
as any other divination tool,

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:90%
or is it special?

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Or does it--

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll say does it offer
maybe more embedded

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.530 align:middle line:84%
or esoteric information
than other divination tools,

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.220 align:middle line:90%
or is it what you put into it?

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Here's the fun part.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Runes were never used
as a divination tool

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.705 align:middle line:90%
until the 1980s.

00:18:28.705 --> 00:18:29.505 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:18:29.505 --> 00:18:30.305 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Really.

00:18:30.305 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:90%
That's my--

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's
when everything came up

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.235 align:middle line:90%
as a divination tool.

00:18:33.235 --> 00:18:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: That's my best
research is I could not

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:84%
determine that until the
1980s, they were never used

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:90%
as divination.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I've done some deep
digging into the lore

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.450 align:middle line:84%
to try to find out
where they're at,

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and there are a
couple of references

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to Norse divination,
definitely horses,

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and birds, different kinds
of allegories in that way.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And there is a term
called blot tines, which

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
means blood sticks, that
were shaken that maybe,

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know that
they were really runes.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
There was some
historical accounts

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:84%
of marking things
on pieces of wood

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.285 align:middle line:84%
and then scattering
them across a cloth,

00:19:05.285 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
that they were runes.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
However, what we know for
a fact from the literature

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:84%
of the Norse people themselves
and from the archaeology

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:84%
from the ruins that
were actually dug up

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:84%
is we know for a fact that
there were magical tools,

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
that there were tools used for
transformation, for healing,

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
for building wealth,
and for making

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:90%
life a much better place.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: By simply
embodying the symbol itself

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
as a representation of
the great creative force.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: I'll go
even a step further,

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:90%
by embodying the sound.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The sound of it.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.345 align:middle line:84%
OK, so each rune
represents a sound.

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.072 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
great things that I

00:19:43.072 --> 00:19:46.540 align:middle line:84%
love about the work of Jonathan
Goldman, the sound healing.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
He talks about the
frequency with intention

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:90%
is manifestation or healing.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, with the runes, you've
got-- say, the rune fehu.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:10%
It deals with value,
with the exchange

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:10%
of energy, information,
money, time, effort,

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:10%
that sort of thing, fehu,
and it has the F sound.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.470 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the letter
F. It sounds like F,

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and so you have now that
FF sound, the fehu sound,

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:90%
with the intention of value.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And so that leads to
your manifestation arc.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And the old form of Norse
magic was called Galdr,

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and it means basically
singing the runes.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And there are ample
references throughout the lore

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:90%
about singing the runes.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So a
healer of the day--

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.130 align:middle line:84%
a great magician
healer of the day

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
would have used incantations
when working with someone

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:90%
that needed rebalancing.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of those healing phrases
that comes to us to this day

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:84%
is found on numerous artifacts,
and the word is Laukaz.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.365 align:middle line:90%
Laukaz alu.

00:20:49.365 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Alu is kind of
like the Norse Om.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:90%
We can get into that one too.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.633 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, do.

00:20:52.633 --> 00:21:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: And if they were to
sing Laukaz Alu (SPEAKING) that

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.362 align:middle line:84%
brings that healing energy
into the person that

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:90%
they're directing it towards.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when you were
starting to really engross

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:84%
yourself into the rediscovery
of your Norse roots so to speak,

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
what area of it were you
particularly fascinated with?

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Was it as a teacher?

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Was it as a healer, a warrior?

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:90%
What really drew you in?

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.195 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: The
ascension potential.

00:21:25.195 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the
spiritual ascension aspect.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:84%
The way I like to look at
runes today is we like--

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:84%
we see runes as these
little characters carved

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:90%
on pieces of wood and stone.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, hey, you can
buy them at Barnes and Noble,

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Toss them
on the table, pick one,

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and you have no idea what
you're supposed to do with it.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.450 align:middle line:84%
But the real rune, the
way I like to think of it

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:84%
is that they are the
subtle connections

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.260 align:middle line:84%
between the subtle layers
of our consciousness

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and the subtle
layers of existence.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need the
actual shape, or the sound,

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:90%
or the name to tap into that.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, two of
the runes that I always

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:84%
talk about when I'm
teaching rune classes

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.720 align:middle line:90%
is mannaz and ansuz.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:10%
Mannaz is a rune of
people of humanity.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:10%
Us gathered here together.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:10%
This is mannaz.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:10%
Us communicating and
talking back and forth,

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:10%
that is the rune ansuz.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:10%
And the exchange of information
could be even the rune of gebo.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:24.400 align:middle line:10%
Not the pieces that are carved,
or written down, or painted,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.060 align:middle line:10%
but the actual living,
breathing energies that

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.010 align:middle line:10%
is vital in our world
and within our beings.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But when you work
with a person individually,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
do you employ the use of
the runes to be given subtle

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.620 align:middle line:84%
information to that person,
access points to that person?

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Mm-hmm.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, how they
will do that is

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I'll teach them how to
create their own little rune

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.288 align:middle line:84%
script based on what
they are looking for.

00:22:45.288 --> 00:22:47.080 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about what
their challenges are,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.497 align:middle line:84%
what some of the
difficulties are,

00:22:48.497 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:90%
what their own strengths are.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And as we're going
through and recording

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.657 align:middle line:84%
what these things
are, I'll think,

00:22:53.657 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is a rune that you
could use because maybe it

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
correlates to inner strength,
which would be eihwaz,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you do need
some more aggressiveness

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.250 align:middle line:84%
in your life, which
would be thurisaz.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I will teach them
how to sing those runes,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and how to bring those energies
into their body, their being,

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:84%
more importantly, how
to go out into the world

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and live those energies so
that they are manifesting them

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.355 align:middle line:90%
through direct action.

00:23:15.355 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and do you find
that a lot of people that find

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:84%
their way to you, like you also
have this memory in their being

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.260 align:middle line:84%
that this may have been a
culture of theirs that they

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.662 align:middle line:84%
resonated within the past
or embodied in the past?

00:23:27.662 --> 00:23:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Yeah, a lot
of those people do.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:30.537 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I would think so.

00:23:30.537 --> 00:23:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: But what's more
interesting to that point is I

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.870 align:middle line:84%
treat English as a sacred
language because a lot

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:84%
of our words that we have like
day comes from the rune dagaz.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:84%
The word year comes
from the rune jera.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Letters like F, S, T, B,
R, C, and I, S, these all

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:84%
are runic letters that have
the same phonetic value that we

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:84%
do today, and the runes
look exactly the same.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And words like mother,
father, sister, brother,

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.673 align:middle line:84%
I can give you a
little bit of training,

00:24:01.673 --> 00:24:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and you'll actually be able
to go to a 2,000-year-old rune

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:84%
stone and read those words
for yourself because they were

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:84%
spoken in the exact same way
2,000 years ago as we say them

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the runes are deeply
embedded in our psyche

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.455 align:middle line:84%
already through the
language that we speak.

00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, fascinating.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
has shadowed humanity

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
is their shadow the whole time,
and the multidimensionality

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of life, and living
within the realm

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.623 align:middle line:90%
of elementals and other beings.

00:24:28.623 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:90%
This has been with us.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people come
to you to work with you

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:84%
because they're being plagued
either by their own shadow

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.270 align:middle line:90%
or by someone shadowing them.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.628 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about--
you talk about something

00:24:40.628 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:84%
called the golden
shadow, which I mentioned

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:90%
when I introduced you.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the golden shadow.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I also want to go
into elementals

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and how you work with people
in managing that interface

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.260 align:middle line:90%
with other realms.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.927 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely,
the golden shadow,

00:24:53.927 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:84%
we're kind of getting into
some Jungian territory,

00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:00.495 align:middle line:84%
which is beautiful because Jung
has done a lot of work with

00:25:00.495 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the Norse tradition,
and with the archetypes,

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.030 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of the areas
of spirituality

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.465 align:middle line:84%
that has kind of always
bugged me is everything

00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:09.840 align:middle line:84%
has to be peace,
love, and light.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.580 align:middle line:90%
We have to be nice and happy.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And if we have something
bad, or negative, or angry,

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.710 align:middle line:84%
or any of the stuff,
we just suppress it.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Be happy and nice, and it's
like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the lessons that the
runes taught me over the years

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:84%
is there are definitely some
happy runes, like wunjo,

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:30.450 align:middle line:84%
like jera, success, joy, all
of these kind of happiness.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
But it also has the
thurisaz, which is

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:90%
about aggression and violence.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.970 align:middle line:84%
It has naudhiz, which is about
neediness and constraint.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.970 align:middle line:84%
It has hagalaz, which is about
disruption and destruction.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.853 align:middle line:84%
These are very
necessary elements

00:25:44.853 --> 00:25:46.020 align:middle line:90%
when working with the runes.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, they are
commonly accepted emotions.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They are part of
the human emotional structure,

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:51.993 align:middle line:90%
whether we like it or not.

00:25:51.993 --> 00:25:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Exactly.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And seeing all of the
peace, love, and light,

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and let's be happy and
ignore the negative,

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I saw so many
devastating things happen

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.753 align:middle line:84%
by people ignoring some
of the darker stuff

00:26:03.753 --> 00:26:04.920 align:middle line:90%
that they needed to look at.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, this was
the downside of the new age--

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Right

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --honestly is
the belief that you dream it

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:84%
so and you're going to have
a happy outcome forever,

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:15.785 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
end of that story.

00:26:15.785 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, most people
didn't experience it.

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And then disillusionment comes
in, and senses of failure

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:84%
start occurring and
so forth because we've

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.500 align:middle line:84%
been ignoring the fact these
are, depending on who we are,

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:90%
parts of our nature.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.845 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, so now
look at-- let's look at how

00:26:32.845 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
the runes and how the Norse
way embodies and embraces these

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.187 align:middle line:84%
and then helps transform
overly negative--

00:26:41.187 --> 00:26:43.270 align:middle line:84%
you know what I'm saying--
emotions into something

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:90%
a little more functional.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.255 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Right, and
specifically with shadow work,

00:26:46.255 --> 00:26:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I tend to work with pagan men
because we have a little bit

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.245 align:middle line:84%
of a subset of challenges
that we're dealing with.

00:26:52.245 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A little?

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Yeah.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Just a little bit.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like what is a man
in today's culture, right?

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.715 align:middle line:84%
It's a big, big issue
right now with men--

00:27:00.715 --> 00:27:01.515 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Exactly

00:27:01.515 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --globally.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: And taking it from the
heathen, the Norse perspective,

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I can actually hit this head
on, straight up, and say, no,

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.848 align:middle line:90%
you are messing up.

00:27:09.848 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
that are the problems.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.010 align:middle line:84%
We need not suck up
and deal with it,

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:90%
but you need to accept it.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.513 align:middle line:84%
You need to look at this
negative part of you, the thing

00:27:17.513 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:90%
that you don't like to see.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to stop, take
that moment, look at it.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But what is it really
trying to say to you?

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Instead of, like, I know
I have this aggression.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.742 align:middle line:90%
I know I have this anger.

00:27:27.742 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm really angry
at this one person.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's feel that anger.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:32.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into that one.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's really produce that anger,
express it right here right

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:84%
now, and let it out so
we get underneath it

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and go, oh, because I have
a level of self-respect

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.150 align:middle line:90%
that I need to honor more.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.708 align:middle line:84%
And this is more about
me setting my boundaries

00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and that I can be more
clear about the boundaries

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.550 align:middle line:90%
that I set.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I can still be
assertive, but now I

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.692 align:middle line:90%
don't need to be angry anymore.

00:27:53.692 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's the golden shadow.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.350 align:middle line:84%
It comes when we deal with
whatever that anger is--

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: As a gift

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: --right up front.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.840 align:middle line:90%
What is it that you're hiding?

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:84%
What is your
superpower that you're

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.813 align:middle line:90%
ignoring because you're just--

00:28:04.813 --> 00:28:05.730 align:middle line:90%
you've got the hatred.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:06.630 align:middle line:90%
You've got the anger.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:07.660 align:middle line:90%
You've got the fear.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:90%
You've got the envy.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's head those things face
on, embrace them, make them

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:90%
bigger, stronger, talk to them.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.530 align:middle line:90%
What are you trying to teach me?

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.510 align:middle line:84%
What is that they need
to learn from this?

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
that golden shadow

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that you've been hiding from
yourself, and you're like, wow,

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize I was that good
of a person this entire time.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.500 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was just this jerk.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was just this
horrible, awful person,

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:84%
but, really, I'm better
than that underneath?

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how much of
this is the breaking down

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:39.870 align:middle line:84%
of a patriarchal mindset that
has existed for thousands

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:90%
of years?

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.253 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Oh, it's 100%
our cultural upbringing,

00:28:43.253 --> 00:28:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of the
absolute things I teach.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean,
masculinity versus patriarchy.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Right.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Two different
things, and this is the struggle

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.230 align:middle line:90%
we're in right now.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And in a little bit, I'm going
to load it toward the women,

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:54.180 align:middle line:90%
so go ahead.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.513 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: That is absolutely it.

00:28:55.513 --> 00:28:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I teach people to get in touch
with their core, the identity

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.110 align:middle line:84%
of who they are,
and sometimes that

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.777 align:middle line:84%
comes from listing
what are your values.

00:29:01.777 --> 00:29:02.577 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:02.577 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: List out your
values, and then go, wait,

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:05.925 align:middle line:90%
that's not really me.

00:29:05.925 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:90%
That's not really me.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I've been taught.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.930 align:middle line:90%
That's a program.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And I love the chaos magicians
have this great saying

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:15.710 align:middle line:90%
that I think embodies it best.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.680 align:middle line:90%
I am that I am not.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.300 align:middle line:84%
It is by identifying what
has been glommed on to you

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.100 align:middle line:90%
culturally--

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What
you are not, yeah.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.645 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: --the
whole patriarchy,

00:29:24.645 --> 00:29:27.050 align:middle line:84%
the whole church upbringing,
the whole school system,

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.532 align:middle line:84%
the parents, the expectations
of who you're supposed to be are

00:29:30.532 --> 00:29:32.990 align:middle line:84%
the shadows that we carry with
us because we want to please

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:90%
these people.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:34.812 align:middle line:90%
They are our authorities.

00:29:34.812 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:84%
We took it on, so, well,
they must know better.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:90%
So I got to be this.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:10%
And then we get to a
certain stage in life

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.920 align:middle line:10%
and they served
you at that point.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.470 align:middle line:10%
But now they are a detriment.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:90%
How do you clear them out?

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from
self-identifying

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.820 align:middle line:90%
who are you at the core?

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.920 align:middle line:90%
What is it that you are not?

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we begin to honor that
to help you at that one time,

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.220 align:middle line:84%
but now we embrace the
core of who you are.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let me
ask you something.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:03.680 align:middle line:84%
When you work with these men
and you strip everything away,

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
you get past all
of the programs,

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.740 align:middle line:84%
you get past the patriarchal
mindset that is a program,

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.940 align:middle line:84%
what do you often find is at
the very bottom of a lot of men

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.545 align:middle line:90%
that would surprise women?

00:30:17.545 --> 00:30:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: I'm not going
to say the word compassion

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.860 align:middle line:84%
because the word's not
necessarily compassion,

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.950 align:middle line:84%
but there is a deep loving
connection that comes from

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:90%
the sacred masculine.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It is definitely
a directed energy.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:31.010 align:middle line:84%
It is more, like, focused,
and here's where we're going,

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:32.120 align:middle line:90%
and where we are.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a sense of
confidence that comes through

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.280 align:middle line:84%
because it was like, oh,
I get this connection,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.640 align:middle line:90%
and I can put it into direction.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Now those are vague
terms, absolutely,

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.910 align:middle line:84%
because I've seen in
every individual person,

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.650 align:middle line:90%
it comes out vastly different.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things I actually key into

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.380 align:middle line:84%
is I'm never going to tell a
person who they are at the core

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and what that is that
their foundation.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let them
discover it because--

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's
the best way, yeah.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: --it really
surprises them sometimes.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And I have not found the case,
but I'm aware of the case--

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.080 align:middle line:84%
some of the old
Vedic traditions--

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:84%
the tale of Jaya and
Vijaya coming to the world

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.630 align:middle line:84%
to be demons so that they
could bring some better--

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.157 align:middle line:84%
the avatars into the world to
make the world a better place.

00:31:12.157 --> 00:31:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they had to be these
horrible, awful people

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.365 align:middle line:90%
throughout their lifetimes.

00:31:15.365 --> 00:31:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I have not
encountered that ever.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually people
have startled themselves,

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:23.330 align:middle line:84%
like, wow, I need to
be more aggressive.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.840 align:middle line:84%
The core of me is actually more
outgoing and more aggressive

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.070 align:middle line:84%
instead of being passive and
accepting, you know, yeah.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the opposite
has been true.

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.740 align:middle line:90%
It was like, wait a minute.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.935 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to be so
active, and aggressive,

00:31:36.935 --> 00:31:38.060 align:middle line:90%
and violent towards people?

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I can actually be
calm and listen?

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what my higher
being wants me to be?

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's
different, but if there

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:84%
is a thread that
goes through, there

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:84%
is a more loving,
deeper connection

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:52.280 align:middle line:84%
that happens because they have
that vulnerability to be open.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.930 align:middle line:84%
They have this
inner strength where

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.897 align:middle line:84%
they can let themselves
be vulnerable,

00:31:55.897 --> 00:31:57.230 align:middle line:90%
and then they open up even more.

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the
awareness to say no.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Here's my boundary of what
I can't be open about.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A few years ago,
it never made it to the air,

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:10.015 align:middle line:84%
but I did a little experimental
roundtable show with men.

00:32:10.015 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about the state

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:15.170 align:middle line:84%
of masculinity and such
today, and we ended up

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:84%
talking about
women because women

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:22.610 align:middle line:84%
have this kind of general sense
because of the programming

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:25.430 align:middle line:90%
of the last thousands of years.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, women have a deep
sense of potential abandonment

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:84%
because they were made
to be reliant upon men

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.580 align:middle line:90%
during the patriarchal years.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.800 align:middle line:84%
That's just now
coming to a point

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:84%
where women don't
need men for survival,

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:84%
but those feelings are still
pixels within our memory,

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:84%
within the aura of
this in the past.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.040 align:middle line:10%
So women are left with this
feeling of, like, anxiety,

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:10%
competition with each other,
and potential abandonment

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.010 align:middle line:10%
as deep core issues.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about all this,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and as it turned out at the
end of the conversation--

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.970 align:middle line:90%
I had three generations of men.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.710 align:middle line:84%
It turned out that
each one of them

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:09.710 align:middle line:84%
stated they had this almost
inexplicably kind of deep love

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:13.850 align:middle line:84%
for women that women
can't feel anymore,

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:17.100 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't show itself in
an overt way for most women.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.450 align:middle line:84%
They're not feeling it, even
with their partners oftentimes.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.790 align:middle line:84%
What do you find
when you dig down

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:27.660 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of the men in
this work, the shadow work?

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Where are women?

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.770 align:middle line:84%
What is their relationship
to the feminine?

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know everyone's
different, but has anything

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.040 align:middle line:84%
emerged as kind of a
portrait of mankind

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:90%
and their feelings toward women?

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Is it fear?

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it love?

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Is it some kind of a strange
combination of the two,

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.860 align:middle line:90%
or even an envy of some kind?

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Procreation of some-- in the
day of feminism, that was, oh,

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.500 align:middle line:84%
well, men are envious
and afraid of women

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.833 align:middle line:90%
because they couldn't procreate.

00:33:56.833 --> 00:33:58.050 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a little pat.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.280 align:middle line:90%
What have you found?

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.195 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Fear.

00:34:00.195 --> 00:34:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Fear.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.085 align:middle line:90%
Fear of the feminine.

00:34:02.085 --> 00:34:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Fear of more of
how they're being perceived.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Some of the men, it's--

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Tell me about that.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Yeah, some of the
men is they have that deep love

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.360 align:middle line:90%
for women.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.770 align:middle line:84%
They have that intent
of letting women

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
know that they want the women
to feel protected, and honored.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But there are other forces
out there, other men,

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and other situations
that the patriarchy--

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I hate the word
toxic masculinity,

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.643 align:middle line:90%
but they're out there.

00:34:25.643 --> 00:34:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And even though they know
at the core of their being

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.489 align:middle line:84%
they're a good
person, they don't

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:32.400 align:middle line:84%
want to be seen as some
of these other guys.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:84%
And so they tend
to be closed off.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.460 align:middle line:84%
They tend to shut
down, or they're

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.500 align:middle line:84%
more protective of
themselves because they

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.850 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be offensive.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to be
rude or anything like that

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:90%
to another woman.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.449 align:middle line:84%
But some of these guys who
are aggressive, and just rude,

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and out there, they've got
fear of rejection going on.

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:51.570 align:middle line:84%
They may have approached
a woman or, even when they

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.768 align:middle line:84%
were younger, a girl
in the wrong way

00:34:53.768 --> 00:34:56.310 align:middle line:84%
because they were learning, and
then they were teased for it.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:84%
They were harassed
for it, and it

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.630 align:middle line:84%
created this vicious cycle of
I'm approaching the wrong way.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's their problem.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.720 align:middle line:84%
They're the one
that's this problem,

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:84%
but it's really fear of how they
are interacting with the world.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you
get into the shadow.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.427 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Fear of
being perceived,

00:35:09.427 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
shame that's out there.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Like, these guys that
are afraid of how they're

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:15.995 align:middle line:84%
going to be perceived
by women, they're

00:35:15.995 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:84%
ashamed of some of the toxic
traits that are out there.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.383 align:middle line:84%
The guys who are very
toxic and aggressive,

00:35:21.383 --> 00:35:22.800 align:middle line:84%
they're ashamed
of the way they've

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.200 align:middle line:84%
been treated in the past, and
they're projecting that shadow

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:25.730 align:middle line:90%
on to other people.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.022 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing about shadows.

00:35:27.022 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:84%
We project it onto people
instead of looking inside.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And so their shadow
of rejection,

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.150 align:middle line:84%
their shadow of fear,
of shame, all of that,

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.280 align:middle line:84%
they're projecting
onto the women,

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.812 align:middle line:84%
but, really, it's
all fear based.

00:35:40.812 --> 00:35:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
address that fear.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So how would you--

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:84%
for the women watching
this because there

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.370 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of women
watching this,

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.580 align:middle line:84%
what would you say to women
at large having worked

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:90%
with a male shadow quite a bit?

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
the whole pagan masculinity

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:59.130 align:middle line:90%
thing here deep and raw, right?

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:01.800 align:middle line:10%
What would you say to women
to help them understand

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:10%
men, the men in their lives a
little bit better after working

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.490 align:middle line:10%
with their shadow?

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: My answer is going
to be a little bit off the cuff

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.530 align:middle line:90%
for this one.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.113 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's OK because I
know you normally work with men

00:36:13.113 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:90%
on this, so I get it.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.663 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: My answer
for this would be,

00:36:15.663 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:84%
men and women the same,
is focus on yourself.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Focus on improving who you
are at the core of your being,

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.920 align:middle line:84%
living your authenticity
as much as you can,

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.240 align:middle line:84%
and sloughing off all of the
fear, all of the expectations,

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:84%
all of the rest
of it because what

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.750 align:middle line:84%
happens if you're
living from the core

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're like a bright
shining light at the core

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:84%
of your authenticity, the
people who are not in resonance

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.130 align:middle line:90%
to that will just fall away.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.152 align:middle line:90%
And that can be painful.

00:36:42.152 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It can be, but this
is the truth for living life

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:45.410 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.912 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Exactly, and the
people who are in resonance are

00:36:47.912 --> 00:36:50.370 align:middle line:84%
going to start coming towards
you because your energies are

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:90%
going to be a frequency.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're having
those difficulties

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.987 align:middle line:84%
with men or with other
people, honor the fact

00:36:56.987 --> 00:36:59.070 align:middle line:84%
that they're going through
their own difficulties,

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.420 align:middle line:90%
their own problems.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Realize that their anger,
their aggression, their--

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.840 align:middle line:84%
all of this stuff is not
really an aspect of you.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It's an aspect that they
need to deal with themselves.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Projected, yeah.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: And I teach
guys this is your problem.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.140 align:middle line:90%
You need to deal with this one.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And as we are, at the
core of our beings,

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.313 align:middle line:84%
living our own authenticity,
these people will fall away,

00:37:18.313 --> 00:37:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and the right people
will start coming to you.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So I would say my best
advice for everyone

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:90%
is focus on yourself.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, just being
your authentic, true self.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Let your own light shine,
and sometimes your shadow

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.002 align:middle line:90%
is going to be there too.

00:37:29.002 --> 00:37:30.668 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: It's always
going to be there.

00:37:30.668 --> 00:37:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And another thing
that was interesting in these

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:middle line:84%
conversations I had with
men, and one of the men

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.535 align:middle line:84%
in particular who is Italian,
who does a lot of this kind

00:37:37.535 --> 00:37:38.640 align:middle line:90%
of work--

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.660 align:middle line:84%
a lot of men's group work,
shadow work, and so forth--

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.710 align:middle line:84%
whenever I would see
him I would say--

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:50.190 align:middle line:84%
at some point, I would use the
word happy in our conversation.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said,
Regina, when are you

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.990 align:middle line:84%
going to understand
that's not a man's word?

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Happy is not a man's word.

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:57.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a woman's word.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.350 align:middle line:84%
You all want to be happy
together, talking, sharing,

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.640 align:middle line:90%
communing with each other.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.970 align:middle line:84%
That's not a word that
really represents men.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:07.845 align:middle line:90%
It can be passionate.

00:38:07.845 --> 00:38:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It can be a lot of things,
but happy isn't our word.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And I had to really
think about that.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Then I started looking at
men and realizing happy

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.417 align:middle line:90%
is not their word.

00:38:19.417 --> 00:38:20.875 align:middle line:84%
What do you have
to say about that?

00:38:20.875 --> 00:38:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: It's true, to the
dismay of my wife and other

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.950 align:middle line:90%
people in my life.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I told them years
ago I realized I

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:29.680 align:middle line:90%
don't want to pursue happiness.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is not on
my course of life.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm pursuing purpose, and I
have a sense of fulfillment,

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:40.330 align:middle line:84%
a sense of relaxation,
my destressing

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:41.980 align:middle line:84%
is when I get
things done that are

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.910 align:middle line:90%
in alignment with my purpose.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.700 align:middle line:84%
However, I have this
caveat with myself

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:84%
because I do embrace
the feminine within,

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and I do accept that I have
feminine traits as all men do.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And if we ignore that we
have our own feminine traits,

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:57.130 align:middle line:84%
then we're denying a very major
powerful part of ourselves.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So to honor that, I say if
I'm on the path of purpose

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and I am pursuing my purpose
with passion, and integrity,

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and happiness finds
its way to me,

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.820 align:middle line:90%
I will embrace that happiness.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.025 align:middle line:84%
I will accept it, and I will
enjoy it for all that it is.

00:39:11.025 --> 00:39:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.060 align:middle line:90%
That's a perfect response.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.490 align:middle line:84%
But this is a problem
between men and women,

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and women usually find their
happy moments with other women.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And also because
you're looking at--

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.860 align:middle line:84%
a man's purpose also can
be highly individual,

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.360 align:middle line:90%
more so than women's.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.057 align:middle line:84%
Where women are working toward
a collaboration-- it's natural.

00:39:32.057 --> 00:39:34.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to care for
your tribe, for your family,

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, you
have to work on behalf

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of the whole more
collaboratively in a more

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.880 align:middle line:90%
sharing manner.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:46.990 align:middle line:10%
You have to be able to work
out disputes between people

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:10%
a little more
efficiently as a woman.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able
to bridge, negotiate,

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:52.960 align:middle line:90%
mediate, and so forth.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And so all of those
things are really

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:59.050 align:middle line:84%
done toward what we call in the
spirit of living a life that

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.370 align:middle line:90%
has happiness at the core.

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And I remember he also
said maybe a better word

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.600 align:middle line:90%
for us would be joy.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: OK.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The joy of having
finished something is not

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:13.210 align:middle line:84%
the same as a women's
version of happy.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: That's exactly one
of the things I teach in all

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.543 align:middle line:84%
of my men's classes and
all of my men's groups.

00:40:18.543 --> 00:40:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And any of the
guys who come to me

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.750 align:middle line:84%
for some one-on-one guidance,
the thing that I emphasize

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.960 align:middle line:84%
over, and over, and over,
and over again is, as a man,

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:84%
we are biologically
wired to need

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.340 align:middle line:90%
occasional moments of solitude.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.810 align:middle line:90%
We have to have the man cave.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:90%
We have to have the den.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I've got my ritual space
that I have at home.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.020 align:middle line:90%
We have to have that alone time.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:84%
That is how we recharge
our testosterone.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.300 align:middle line:84%
That's how we zero out, how
we decompress, and destress.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And women need to
bond with each other.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.200 align:middle line:84%
They need to get
together, and this

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.910 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of times
some of the problems

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:49.960 align:middle line:90%
that happen in relationships--

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.877 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, hugely.

00:40:50.877 --> 00:40:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: --is the woman wants
to have her connection time.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.270 align:middle line:90%
The man needs the alone time.

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.030 align:middle line:84%
She'll have that
feel of abandonment.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, why is he
leaving me alone?

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And I say, stop, you do
need your alone time.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.490 align:middle line:84%
You do need your solitude, and
you need to communicate that.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Say, hey, babe, I love you.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:07.970 align:middle line:90%
I want to be there for you.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Can you give me 30 minutes?

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I'll come back,
and I promise you

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.570 align:middle line:90%
we can deal with this together.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And I teach them
that communication.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Just that saying I
need this time for me.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's really
important because when we were

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.135 align:middle line:84%
living in tribal times, the
men went and did their thing.

00:41:21.135 --> 00:41:22.940 align:middle line:84%
The women were with
women, and that's--

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.510 align:middle line:84%
you'd sleep together, but that
was kind of the extent of it.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Now we're all one big happy--

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.600 align:middle line:84%
what do you call
modern humanity,

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.200 align:middle line:84%
where we're all supposed to
be equal on all, in all ways,

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.940 align:middle line:84%
on all levels,
and we're supposed

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.570 align:middle line:84%
to be able to live in a
nuclear family environment

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:42.370 align:middle line:84%
where everybody
is being honored?

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And women want their husband
to be their bestie, right?

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And the men want
to, like, get away

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the time for
their own purposes.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:90%
And there are.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I've had huge misunderstandings
of this in my relationships

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:58.480 align:middle line:84%
with men thinking,
wow, they're grouchy,

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.010 align:middle line:90%
kind of isolating themselves.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.602 align:middle line:90%
And I took it personally.

00:42:02.602 --> 00:42:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I took it personally
my whole life,

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.955 align:middle line:84%
really, because I didn't
understand anything about men.

00:42:06.955 --> 00:42:08.080 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't raised around any.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.180 align:middle line:84%
There were no boys,
no cousins, nothing.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
anything about boys.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's taken me a really
long time to understand

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.680 align:middle line:90%
we are essentially different.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.930 align:middle line:10%
Purpose is more of a
man's way, and that

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:22.060 align:middle line:10%
doesn't have to be
taken personally

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:26.680 align:middle line:10%
to us, who are looking for that
happy, wonderful connection.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Right, and I
think, as human beings,

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.580 align:middle line:84%
since we have the masculine
and feminine within each of us,

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.380 align:middle line:90%
we can have it all.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I think so.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.070 align:middle line:84%
We just have to, like you
say, have the language

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:84%
to honor each other and what
we each need because you

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.610 align:middle line:90%
have to give too to your wife.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:41.110 align:middle line:90%
She's going to want to.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: She's going to
want to have her nice, fun,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.290 align:middle line:90%
connected time with you so--

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: And she gets it.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And she gets it.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:46.090 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.260 align:middle line:90%
I know you're a team player.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.005 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about--
in the time left,

00:42:49.005 --> 00:42:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk
about the work you

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.980 align:middle line:84%
do with the elementals, which
were part of the ancient way

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and the tribal way
of understanding.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.430 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a
multidimensional world

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of entities
surrounding us at all times

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:05.260 align:middle line:84%
from wonderful guiding forces
to irritating ones, wee folk.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely, and
that's one of the areas I do

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.720 align:middle line:84%
specialize in is paranormal
protection because over

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.420 align:middle line:84%
the years that I've worked with
haunted houses and people with

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:17.493 align:middle line:84%
paranormal problems, I
have found that in over 90%

00:43:17.493 --> 00:43:19.410 align:middle line:84%
of the cases where there's
something bad going

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:22.160 align:middle line:84%
on in the house, it's a thought
form or it's poltergeist.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.177 align:middle line:90%
It's self-generated.

00:43:23.177 --> 00:43:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The humans in the
house are creating--

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Egregore is
another word for it.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:26.855 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:43:26.855 --> 00:43:27.807 align:middle line:90%
Egregore, right?

00:43:27.807 --> 00:43:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the things I
kind of help teach people to--

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I teach people to
communicate with an egregore

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.320 align:middle line:84%
rather than try to get
rid of it because they're

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:34.740 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more intelligent.

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's about
the nature of self-created

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:37.860 align:middle line:90%
entities.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Those-- and that's the
majority of the time that are

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.070 align:middle line:84%
thought forms, and the Norse
have a word for that one,

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:47.175 align:middle line:84%
Hugham, basically thought
shape, thought form.

00:43:47.175 --> 00:43:48.607 align:middle line:90%
It's still the same word.

00:43:48.607 --> 00:43:50.940 align:middle line:84%
It is when you have an obsessive
emotion over, and over,

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and over, and over again, like
fear, fear, fear, fear, fear,

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.610 align:middle line:84%
you will create a ball of
energy that is now loaded

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:90%
with fear energy, and it lives.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:59.530 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:00.488 align:middle line:90%
It's not an evil thing.

00:44:00.488 --> 00:44:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's its
own entity so to speak.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.905 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: But when
it needs a recharge,

00:44:03.905 --> 00:44:05.280 align:middle line:84%
it'll poke with
some fear energy.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, what's here?

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:06.960 align:middle line:90%
What's bothering?

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.320 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: And it gets a charge,
and it's like, oh, thank you.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Or could be anger, or
it could be hatred.

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:14.700 align:middle line:90%
It could be blind love.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.500 align:middle line:90%
It could be over-emphasized joy.

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.810 align:middle line:84%
It could be any of these
kind of emotional states,

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.280 align:middle line:90%
and it will poke a person.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And if that person's like,
there's something here,

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.993 align:middle line:84%
there's something scary, they're
creating a poltergeist effect

00:44:24.993 --> 00:44:26.280 align:middle line:90%
through their own telekinesis.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, something goes
flying across the room.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.340 align:middle line:90%
This thing is fed.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, wow,
I can poke you.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Something goes flying
across the room.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:35.440 align:middle line:90%
I get fed even more?

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.240 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.420 align:middle line:90%
That's 90% of the cases or more.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.660 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the cases
are hidden folk.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, hidden folk.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:84%
The wee folk, the fairies, and
the leprechauns, and the silfs,

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, a lot of
the Devic realm that

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.740 align:middle line:84%
is not just a projection
but a part of nature.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.845 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:44:53.845 --> 00:44:56.220 align:middle line:84%
There are natural-- and that's
one of the things I really

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.290 align:middle line:84%
emphasize in all of
my paranormal work

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.510 align:middle line:90%
is the paranormal is normal.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Supernatural is natural.

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: We co-exist as
multidimensional beings.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And when there's a problem,
elemental, in the house,

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:11.580 align:middle line:84%
it's usually because the people
in the house upset something.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.290 align:middle line:90%
They had a stone in their yard.

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:15.960 align:middle line:84%
They moved the stone
over, it disrupted

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.990 align:middle line:90%
the house of this being.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.812 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Or they're
in a logging community,

00:45:19.812 --> 00:45:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and they cut down some trees
where these things live.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.365 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, you
messed with my house.

00:45:24.365 --> 00:45:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come
mess with your house.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: In Norse lore is
rife with tiny little examples.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you notice in your
doorway some straw or some dirt

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and you don't
clean it up, that's

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.540 align:middle line:84%
a little bugger putting some
stuff there to test you--

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: --because
they like clean homes,

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and they like things
to be nice and orderly.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.777 align:middle line:84%
And so if you clean
that up and you

00:45:44.777 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:84%
notice these little
problems going on,

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.690 align:middle line:84%
one of the best things
I try to do to people

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.490 align:middle line:84%
is tell them to create a little
alter in their home, just

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:52.290 align:middle line:90%
a little place.

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:53.865 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A place where
they can be honored.

00:45:53.865 --> 00:45:55.657 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Where they
can be honored, right.

00:45:55.657 --> 00:45:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Maybe put some oatmeal there.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Maybe put some milk.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.080 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't work, some
whiskey, some tobacco,

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.000 align:middle line:84%
some sage, something
as an offering,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.200 align:middle line:90%
and then replenish it.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Stay on top of it.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it go bad.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you do see a
wild animal or an animal

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.460 align:middle line:84%
coming and eating it,
partaking of it, let it.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.680 align:middle line:90%
That's just how it is received.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And all you're really doing
is just honoring that force.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes it takes
a little bit extra work.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.178 align:middle line:84%
Like, we'll sit
down, and we'll try

00:46:20.178 --> 00:46:21.908 align:middle line:90%
to open a line of communication.

00:46:21.908 --> 00:46:23.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't communicate
in words like we do.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.533 align:middle line:84%
They communicate in
what I call impressions.

00:46:25.533 --> 00:46:28.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just like you'll get
the impression of a hole

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.950 align:middle line:84%
in the ground where there
used to be something,

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and they want that
something back.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you're like, did you
move something in your yard?

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Is there something?

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, I wanted a
better view of this tree

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.700 align:middle line:84%
over there, so I moved
this rock out of the way.

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, you need
to put it back.

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:42.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: And then when
they put the rock back,

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.452 align:middle line:90%
they make the little offerings.

00:46:45.452 --> 00:46:46.500 align:middle line:90%
They do their mea culpas.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The hidden
folk are happy.

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Right, the
hidden folk are happy,

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and you go back to
peacefully coexisting.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:52.988 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about the ones we create.

00:46:52.988 --> 00:46:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll go away from the
hidden folk in the elementals

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.760 align:middle line:90%
into the ones we create.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.630 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal--

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:01.710 align:middle line:84%
once you have created an
egregore or a thought form that

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:04.270 align:middle line:84%
is a projection of your
own repeated emotions,

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.892 align:middle line:84%
how do you then kind
of get rid of it?

00:47:05.892 --> 00:47:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: One of the best
stories I tell when I teach

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.490 align:middle line:84%
seance classes is a
story of not of my own,

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:14.970 align:middle line:84%
but growing up in the
spiritualist community and with

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:17.850 align:middle line:84%
the different seance groups,
one of the people I got to know

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:19.890 align:middle line:84%
a little bit was
Dr. Robert Bradley,

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:21.690 align:middle line:90%
inventor of the Bradley method.

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:25.240 align:middle line:84%
It was actually my mom's doctor
when she was pregnant with me.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever saw the movie
in the '70s, "The Changeling"

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.490 align:middle line:90%
with George C Scott--

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:31.515 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: --that is
about Dr. Robert Bradley.

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: And his story as
a materialist reductionist

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.268 align:middle line:84%
doctor, atheist, there
is no paranormal.

00:47:37.268 --> 00:47:38.310 align:middle line:90%
There is no supernatural.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:39.630 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.330 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of the night
goes to sit in his parlor,

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:46.650 align:middle line:84%
watches his cigar lighter lift
up off the table, and drop.

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:50.270 align:middle line:84%
From that moment
on, fear, scared.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, these
stories are real.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:53.970 align:middle line:90%
This is actually happening.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:56.010 align:middle line:84%
The energy in the house
threw him down-- tried

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:57.300 align:middle line:90%
to throw him down the stairs.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.170 align:middle line:90%
It broke a mirror.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.420 align:middle line:84%
He had a scar on his neck
from where the mirror broke.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.490 align:middle line:84%
It was so drastic
that they actually

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.420 align:middle line:84%
were able to make a movie
about how the whole telekinesis

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.302 align:middle line:84%
and how the thought
form was there.

00:48:08.302 --> 00:48:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But throughout the seances
and throughout everything,

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.210 align:middle line:84%
he realized there
was a little boy

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:14.953 align:middle line:84%
in that house, a little
spirit of a boy in the house.

00:48:14.953 --> 00:48:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the boy is
scared to death of this thought

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.300 align:middle line:90%
form that the doctor created.

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And when the doctor
changed his attitude

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:23.248 align:middle line:84%
and realized I made
this thought form,

00:48:23.248 --> 00:48:24.540 align:middle line:90%
here's this little boy scared--

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, frightened.

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: --how can I help you?

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:28.337 align:middle line:90%
What can you do to help you?

00:48:28.337 --> 00:48:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And I realize I'm no longer
attached to this thing.

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.940 align:middle line:84%
The thought form
lost its energy.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.720 align:middle line:84%
It lost its control,
and they were

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.440 align:middle line:84%
able to have great seances and
great interactions with spirits

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.590 align:middle line:84%
from that moment on
because he realized

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:42.460 align:middle line:90%
he was creating his own fear.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.890 align:middle line:84%
He was realized he
was perpetuating

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.080 align:middle line:90%
the cycle of negative energy.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel
that coming in,

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.940 align:middle line:84%
realize it's not coming from
you, and you can stop it.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.210 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing
I teach anybody,

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:56.927 align:middle line:84%
anywhere, anytime
that if they're

00:48:56.927 --> 00:48:58.510 align:middle line:84%
under the attack of
a negative entity,

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:00.880 align:middle line:84%
no matter what kind, it's
self-created, or an egregore,

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.960 align:middle line:84%
or anything, the first thing
that you want to do is laugh.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.838 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Laugh until
your eyes crinkle.

00:49:06.838 --> 00:49:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, so the levity
of it breaks that energy

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:10.000 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: It becomes poisonous.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: That thing is
trying to tap you with anger,

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and if you laugh back,
it's going to go.

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:18.880 align:middle line:84%
You're giving me--
oh, I'm out of here.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: I don't want this.

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.590 align:middle line:90%
So if you laugh at it--

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: --honesty,
it's not going to take it

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:22.530 align:middle line:90%
as an offensive.

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:25.007 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to go,
oh, you're offending me.

00:49:25.007 --> 00:49:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It's going to feel that energy
and be like, this is poisonous.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It will
be repulsed by it.

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: It'll be repulsed,
and it will leave you alone.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let me ask you
something very contemporary,

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:36.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, and that is the whole notion
of a collective egregore that

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:42.772 align:middle line:84%
is being and has been created
by the COVID-19 global shutdown.

00:49:42.772 --> 00:49:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: This is a
very interesting one,

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.235 align:middle line:84%
and I asked the
whisperers about this.

00:49:46.235 --> 00:49:47.360 align:middle line:90%
I work with a black mirror.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.060 align:middle line:84%
That's my primary tool when
I'm sitting in meditation

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.490 align:middle line:84%
communicating with him,
and I wanted some insights

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:54.850 align:middle line:90%
to what was going on.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that we
are on a singular path.

00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:59.570 align:middle line:84%
There is only one
outcome to this one,

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:00.987 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
going to tell me.

00:50:00.987 --> 00:50:02.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, come on, guys.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't going
to give me prophecy,

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.700 align:middle line:84%
but they said, what you
can do with this energy--

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.397 align:middle line:84%
and they say to treat
this zeitgeist energy--

00:50:09.397 --> 00:50:11.480 align:middle line:84%
in fact, they don't want
to use the word egregore.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:84%
They're poking don't
call it an egregore.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Call it a zeitgeist.

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A zeitgeist.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: It's a very--

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's good.

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: --similar energy,
but it's used differently.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.240 align:middle line:84%
The zeitgeist is an
energy that we can either

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.728 align:middle line:84%
get inundated with, like if
it's a wave pouring over us,

00:50:23.728 --> 00:50:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and we can get drowned,
and sucked into it,

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and just pulled down,
or you can choose

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.502 align:middle line:84%
to use this energy as a way
that you could ride on top of

00:50:31.502 --> 00:50:32.710 align:middle line:90%
to propel you into a higher--

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Total agreed.

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:34.075 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: --state of being.

00:50:34.075 --> 00:50:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Totally agreed.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:39.205 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: And it's us to decide
if we get inundated or excel.

00:50:39.205 --> 00:50:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We
choose the outcome.

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Exactly.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Any final words about
the work you're doing and--

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:47.750 align:middle line:84%
or any other little
piece that we

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:51.200 align:middle line:84%
didn't get to in terms of
the magic of the Norse way

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and of the runes before
we sign off here?

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:55.272 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Let me share one
little technique that I love

00:50:55.272 --> 00:50:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to share with people
with working with runes.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I call it the wunjo
nauthiz shift.

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Wunjo, we talked about, is a
rune of joy, about happiness,

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.180 align:middle line:90%
about having.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:07.970 align:middle line:10%
Nauthiz is a rune of needs,
and necessity, constraints.

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:11.750 align:middle line:10%
And the way I teach the wunjo
nauthiz shift in people is it's

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:14.480 align:middle line:10%
a reframing of your situation.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.030 align:middle line:10%
Let's say it's the
end of the month.

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:17.488 align:middle line:84%
You paid all your
bills, and you go

00:51:17.488 --> 00:51:20.000 align:middle line:84%
to look at your bank account,
and you've got $20 left.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.120 align:middle line:84%
A nauthiz perspective is like,
[GASP] I've got $20 left.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.440 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But you can go let's
look at it from a wunjo.

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:32.048 align:middle line:84%
I paid everything, and I
have some money left over.

00:51:32.048 --> 00:51:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And because you're able
to make that shift,

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.720 align:middle line:84%
the universe is a reflection
of itself in all ways.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in this
constraint, this necessity,

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:42.080 align:middle line:84%
neediness mode, you're going
to end up with more neediness.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Contraction
versus expansion.

00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Exactly.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you can be
in that wunjo state,

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:49.570 align:middle line:84%
that happy, joyful state
of, OK, I have $20--

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:51.420 align:middle line:84%
this is cool, and
everything's paid off.

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:52.680 align:middle line:90%
I am provided for--

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.112 align:middle line:84%
then that will reflect
back on to you.

00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:57.570 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the most simplest
but powerful ways I teach--

00:51:57.570 --> 00:51:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very powerful.

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: --people to the
runes is to shift the way you

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.380 align:middle line:84%
interact with the world and
see the world so that the world

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.450 align:middle line:84%
meets you at that
energetic level.

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful.

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:10.030 align:middle line:84%
That was-- thank you
for sharing that.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.980 align:middle line:90%
I love what you have--

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen you at
Gaia through the years

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and I love the way
you've progressed

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.520 align:middle line:84%
in your own life
and the way you've

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.250 align:middle line:84%
more consolidated this
work you're doing--

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:24.360 align:middle line:84%
the pagan men work, the shadow
work, and your work with runes.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.550 align:middle line:10%
And you also have
a book, which we're

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:29.310 align:middle line:10%
going to talk about in just
a second as we sign off here.

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:31.570 align:middle line:10%
So I'm happy we're able to
do this finally, Kaedrich.

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Me too.

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And thank you
for all your hard work,

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for bringing
some of the Norse magic to us.

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>> OLSEN: Thank you
for this opportunity.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.283 align:middle line:90%
This was really wonderful.

00:52:39.283 --> 00:52:40.827 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying it very much.

00:52:40.827 --> 00:52:42.660 align:middle line:10%
