[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:18.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: We've
all heard of voodoo,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:10%
but how about hoodoo?

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle line:10%
Today we have a
guest who's going

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:10%
to share with us a
system of divination that

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:10%
is unique to the Indigenous and
African populations that lived

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:10%
in America from its inception.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
This system of divination has
been distilled by Tayannah Lee

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
McQuillar, and we're here
to find out all about it.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I find it absolutely
fascinating.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we need to get out
here what you do, who you are.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So you're a cultural
anthropologist,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:84%
a religious scholar, a
mystic, and a practitioner

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:90%
of something called Rootwork.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>TAYANNAH LEE MCQUILLAR: Yes.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is really
grounded into the cards,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:90%
the deck of cards.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fascinating
deck of cards.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:10%
I loved reading the book and
then playing with the cards

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:10%
afterward.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Because it's tarot, but it's
tarot through your lens,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:84%
through this
Indigenous lens that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:90%
works with plants and ancestors.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit right
off the bat about hoodoo,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
tarot, and how this
all came together.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:10%
>> MCQUILLAR: Well, hoodoo is a
body of botanical and esoteric

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:10%
knowledge that was created
or formulated during colonial

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:10%
times.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a miscegenation of ideas
between Africans, Europeans

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:90%
and Indigenous people.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I created the tarot because I am
a product of all these people.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And the tarot decks
that were available,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.260 align:middle line:84%
that were marketed to Black
people, I didn't see my family.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see our lineage,
the landscapes, the colors,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:90%
the just everything.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
why don't I do that?

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This also
runs in your family,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:90%
right, the use of divination.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about your
grandma, your grandmother,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.520 align:middle line:84%
the ancestors, and how
this flowed through to you.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Well, my paternal
grandmother was a Rootworker,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.840 align:middle line:84%
a well-known one, and
she used playing cards.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And she divined through dreams.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:84%
That was very commonly used as
a form of divination for people.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
On my mother's side, we
also have Rootworkers,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:84%
but they were more tied
in with the church.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
the playing cards

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:84%
so much as you do have dream
interpretation and also

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.420 align:middle line:84%
augury, observing animals,
observing the weather,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would
you say, regardless

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
of whether a person's
lineage comes from Africa

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
or the Caribbean or
wherever it comes from,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
that this more
innate understanding

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:84%
of intuitive forces, of knowing
to pay attention to your dreams,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
as such, is indigenous in
general to the Black populations

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.898 align:middle line:84%
that immigrated
here from wherever?

00:03:07.898 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Absolutely,
I think it's worldwide.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why you find these
practices in all cultures,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:84%
all traditions, just
connecting with the land

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and also using the land
to inform the self.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So that just-- that's
just a worldwide thing.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
But this particular
tradition has its lineage

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
in the Woodlands, in the
Southeast and the Northeast.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:90%
So just this whole coast here.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The East Coast.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very distinct
lineage because it's

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:90%
like no other lineage.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:84%
United States has a
very unique history.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem, is
that everybody's kind of put--

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
kind of mushed together
just based on phenotype.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's a mistake.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain that to us--

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.995 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Facial features.

00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --why it's a mistake.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.317 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Because
we have a unique--

00:03:59.317 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
we have a unique history here
that happened nowhere else.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
We have an Indigenous
population that was enslaved.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And we don't talk
about that a lot,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.530 align:middle line:84%
but they worked right
alongside the African slaves

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:90%
and the indentured Europeans.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was working together.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of slavery
movies and things

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
like that, you don't see just
how diverse the colonial America

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And also these kind
of mega slave owners

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
with movies like Roots, where
you see hundreds of people

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:90%
out there--

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: That's like saying
everybody in colonial America

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:90%
owned a Maserati.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It wasn't like that.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.567 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: No, it wasn't.

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Most of the slave owners were
working alongside the slaves,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and most people only
owned less than 10 people.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: So everybody
was working side by side,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.420 align:middle line:84%
whether they were
indentured, free, or not.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were mixing
for about 100 years

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
before you have these
anti-miscegenation laws.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right!

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
we're not told, either.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: No.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.615 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so,
OK, first of all,

00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:84%
you don't like being called
African-American because just

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
because you're Black doesn't
mean that you're from Africa.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Your people, initial
genealogy, was from Africa.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Could have been anywhere.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.357 align:middle line:84%
So you say it hails back to
a more indigenous species.

00:05:14.357 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Right.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So I have ancestors that
were broad-featured that

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
have my appearance, but they
were reclassified as people

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:90%
of African descent or mulatto.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Like I was telling
you before, the Indian

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
was killed more with the pen
than with disease or war.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you had people
from India, the Black people

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:84%
from India, that were
reclassified as Negro.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:84%
You had Gypsies that were
reclassified as Negro.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Black community
is not a monolith.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Why did they reclassify
everyone as Negro?

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Why just-- why did you try to
make one bulk classification

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.370 align:middle line:84%
of people just because their
skin was a few shades darker?

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Well,
it was just so-- well,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:84%
for the Indigenous population,
it was a way to remove them from

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:90%
the land.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: OK?

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To reclassify.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: To reclassify
them to steal the land.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then they get lumped
in with the slave population

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Well, they
were enslaved as well.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
were enslaved.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So terms like "massa," like
a lot of people think that is

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:84%
a product of maybe Black
people not being able to speak

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
properly, when that was actually
an Algonquin word that meant

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:90%
boss.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Massa?

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah, boss.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boss, massa.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's things like that.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:84%
We're just not taught
American history the way

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:90%
it should be taught.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's the truth.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.258 align:middle line:84%
We are so uninformed in
America about our history.

00:06:34.258 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Absolutely.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.758 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you just said
something a little bit ago,

00:06:37.758 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
not only did people work
alongside one another,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:84%
people actually had
not just friendships,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of intermarriage
early on as the people

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
came over from Ireland and
England and also the Scotsmen.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk specifically
about the Scots

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and how that kind of crosses
over in terms of clans.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we still know that
the Scots-Irish that are

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.530 align:middle line:84%
living in Appalachia
are very clan oriented.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, JD Vance
is a representative

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
of that in Hillbilly
Elegy, where he says,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:90%
these are truly hillbillies.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.116 align:middle line:84%
That is a class of people
that are Scots-Irish.

00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Right.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.678 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Similar to the
people that came in the day.

00:07:13.678 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about who they were

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and how this came together with
the Indigenous populations.

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Well,
you have the Scottish,

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:84%
they were oppressed by the
British and their culture was

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:90%
considered uncivilized.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And it just-- the
bias was tremendous.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So when they got
here, they can relate

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:84%
to the problems that
were happening here

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and the devastation,
the genocide.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So these populations
came together

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:90%
and they started to have babies.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And they started
to exchange ideas.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that's dated anyone
outside of their race

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:84%
or ethnicity knows that you
don't just exchange feelings,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:90%
you're exchanging ideas.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.535 align:middle line:90%
You may be getting recipes.

00:07:58.535 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:90%
Times are the same all the time.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.920 align:middle line:90%
People don't change.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: So that's how
these people came together

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and it created this thing
that we call hoodoo now.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It's all of these different
people coming together

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:90%
like a gumbo.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.393 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Clans
working with nature.

00:08:16.393 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Clans
working with nature.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And a similarity, also,
just with the geography.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Because you have the
Appalachian Mountains that are--

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:84%
the Scots actually said,
this looks like the mountains

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.100 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Highlands.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah, it looks
just like the Highlands.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm Scot,
Irish and German,

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:84%
so I've got I've got a little
bit of that blood, quite

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:84%
a bit of that blood,
actually, in me, too.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.430 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.549 align:middle line:90%
And they were scallywags.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My ancestors
were scallywags.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Terrible.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: And you get a lot
of teachings through your mom.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Your mother is
your first teacher.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And what they don't teach
us about American history,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.590 align:middle line:84%
especially during
colonial times,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
is that most of the
mixing that went on

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
was between white women,
or European women,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and Indigenous men
or African men.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.032 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.032 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the
other way around?

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Because we always think
of it as the Massa

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.940 align:middle line:90%
with the beautiful, young slave.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: No.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.407 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not
what was happening.

00:09:10.407 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: No, not to the
extent that they've been telling

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and from
what you're saying, too,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:90%
it's interesting.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Because people still say,
well, America was founded--

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
founded upon the notion
of freedom of expression.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And religious freedom,
in particular.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, reading your book--
and I've read this before--

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write down
here, before 1760, only

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:40.897 align:middle line:84%
15% of the Americans that had
come over were religious at all.

00:09:40.897 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
These were not--
these were people who

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.482 align:middle line:90%
came over like my ancestors.

00:09:44.482 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:90%
You'd do what you have to do.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Steal a little land here,
get away with what you can,

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:90%
try to make a buck.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of what
was really going on.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And forming new relationships
with the people that you landed

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:90%
amongst.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It was not this
glorious, on-high people,

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:90%
puritanical thing.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: No.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Puritans existed.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.185 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that was not
the bulk of the population.

00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:06.018 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Right.

00:10:06.018 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:84%
The bulk of the
European population

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a
choice to come here.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.627 align:middle line:84%
And that's also something
we don't discuss.

00:10:12.627 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:90%
They came in chains.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.627 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like my relatives.

00:10:14.627 --> 00:10:17.359 align:middle line:84%
Well, and my relatives
got criminals or whatnot.

00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:18.192 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Right!

00:10:18.192 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:84%
The prisons were
opened up, the treason.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, all these
undesirables in Europe

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:84%
were sent here
against their will.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:90%
But you don't see movies--

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: --with Europeans
screaming and chains and being

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:90%
forced onto a boat.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But that's exactly
what happened.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we're
getting the picture

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.668 align:middle line:84%
that we had a lot of people
that came here involuntarily.

00:10:40.668 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Absolutely.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some
people came here

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't get
along where they were.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of had to beat it
out of town and they came here.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And so everyone was
surviving on a new land.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
We all had clans of
one kind or another.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And we were all
dependent upon the land.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so did the
Indigenous population start

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.720 align:middle line:84%
inculcating the notion
of cards and divination

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.610 align:middle line:84%
into the European
populations that came?

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: No.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
They had what they
called scapulimancy.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was that?

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: That's
just reading bones.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Or small objects.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.235 align:middle line:84%
Where you take them in
your hand and cast them.

00:11:19.235 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like runes?

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So their playing cards
came from Europeans.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was just another
tool that was used.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And Indigenous people were
pretty open about incorporating

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:90%
different ideas.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why they adopted
the fashion pretty quickly.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things weren't
forced on people

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:90%
as much as we like to think.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
People were just broad-minded.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And they used--
so the same thing

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:90%
applied with occult knowledge.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, like the
fashion, as you say--

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
you and I were
talking off camera--

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
that early in our lives, we
both had a fascination with 18th

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.688 align:middle line:90%
century women's fashion.

00:11:54.688 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Absolutely.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I did.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.822 align:middle line:84%
I was designing things, little
button-up things, little pearl

00:11:58.822 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:84%
buttons that I
designed just like you.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we were
probably around at that time,

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, both of us.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.678 align:middle line:90%
I know I was.

00:12:06.678 --> 00:12:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: I'm more of,
like, about 100 years later,

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:90%
about 1870.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah, Victorian.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Little bit after.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah,
a little bit after.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:90%
But I love 18th century fashion.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:15.270 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, now, let's go
ahead and start defining--

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:84%
now that we've laid
the scene out--

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:90%
Rootwork.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:90%
What is Rootwork?

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Well Rootwork is
just another term for hoodoo,

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:90%
so it's interchangeable.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Hoodoo is actually a term
that Black people did not use.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
If we went into a
time machine, they

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't know what hoodoo was.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how hoodoo
got into the lexicon.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:90%
I'd have no idea.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But people understand
it as hoodoo.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.045 align:middle line:90%
People understand Rootwork.

00:12:40.045 --> 00:12:42.003 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it means
working with the land

00:12:42.003 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and literally working
with your book.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I drew a card.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.270 align:middle line:90%
It was wonderful.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And Angelica came with my
card, the Angelica extract,

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:90%
which I immediately bought.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah!

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I started
doing little--

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
little drops of
under the tongue.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So it comes with going
into relationship

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
with what we know now as these
incredibly refined frequencies

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:84%
of Bach flower remedies
and other extracts,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.395 align:middle line:84%
like the roots and the
blossoms that you talk about

00:13:08.395 --> 00:13:09.195 align:middle line:90%
in your book.

00:13:09.195 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Right.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So each
one of these cards

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.848 align:middle line:90%
is associated with one of those.

00:13:12.848 --> 00:13:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Absolutely.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Tea was the primary
medicine during the-- well,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:84%
anytime before the Industrial
era for Black people.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was?

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Tea.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:90%
The use of tea.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The use of tea.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we relied on the land to
provide us with this medicine.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:90%
So it had to do with respect.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Respecting the land meant
you get stronger plants,

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:84%
energetically, to
heal your body.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I incorporated
that into the tarot deck,

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
so that people can learn that
native plants are important

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
a lot of emphasis

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
has been on Asian or-- whether
it be, yeah, that kind of thing.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:04.228 align:middle line:84%
But if something were to happen,
how many of us know the plants--

00:14:04.228 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --surrounding
us that we can use?

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Comfrey, things like that.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:07.746 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Right.

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:08.546 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:08.546 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Did they do-- this is a little
aside-- did they do tea reading?

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was that
a common divination

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:84%
tool to read the tea leaves
in the bottom of the cup?

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.737 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Tea
leaves, coffee grinds.

00:14:17.737 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
You can, if you look at a
lot of 19th century art,

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
you will see a lot of Black
women shown reading playing

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:84%
cards and also
reading tea leaves.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.767 align:middle line:84%
So another question is, hoodoo
sounds a lot like voodoo.

00:14:32.767 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And as I said in my open,
everyone knows that voodoo is.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
They think they do, and
they're afraid of it.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about voodoo.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And does voodoo ever intersect
with all of this at any point?

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Are there points
of intersection?

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Well, I think
just being here in the States.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, voodoo is practiced in
Mississippi, in Louisiana,

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:90%
primarily.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.378 align:middle line:90%
But it's a religion.

00:14:56.378 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes it different.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.230 align:middle line:84%
We just think-- we
just think it's casting

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.947 align:middle line:90%
spells, the white population.

00:15:02.947 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Right.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:90%
No, it is not.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.150 align:middle line:90%
It is a religion like any other.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.460 align:middle line:84%
It has beliefs
about the afterlife.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:90%
You have deities.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:84%
You have practitioners
or priests.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
You have a very
strict hierarchy.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes it
different than hoodoo.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:84%
There is no-- there
are no regulators.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:90%
There are no intermediaries.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
The elders are your
family members.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It's an oral tradition
that's passed down.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:84%
There's no uniformity
to our tradition,

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
whereas maybe if
you go to Louisiana,

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see a
little bit more uniformity.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But voodoo itself is
also practiced in Africa.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So it takes on a
different flavor in Africa

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:84%
than it does in the South, the
South of the United States.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:90%
So that's the difference.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
interesting because people

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
know this about me, I've studied
hermetics for many years.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And they do-- it's a very
interesting body of information

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.850 align:middle line:84%
about different capabilities,
mental capabilities,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
different traditions around
the world throughout time.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And it talked about
voodoo being used

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
in indigenous ways for
magic as well, to use magic.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And how in the real
medicine men that

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:84%
knew how to use their
minds, were incredibly

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:90%
effective and powerful.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So when they cast a
spell at that time,

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's good or
bad, it was very powerful

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and had it could change
physical reality.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.162 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that's
something people, when they--

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
they're not incorrect to
say, oh I'm scared of that

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
because someone could
cast some voodoo on me

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:90%
and I'd be screwed or whatever.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.898 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is possible if
you got with a really, really

00:16:47.898 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:90%
skilled medicine person.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Sure.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
just mental mastery

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:84%
in that particular modality
of thinking and healing.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.597 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: That's it.

00:16:56.597 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what it is.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in America, now we
get we go a little bit forward

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and we have a lot of Black
churches, Christian churches.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones you
say that often suppressed

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
these practices,
the hoodoo practices

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.660 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs and religion.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:90%
Why did they do that?

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
And what was the result of
that to the populations that

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:22.030 align:middle line:90%
were here in America?

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Well--

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.334 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us some real
history and education on this.

00:17:26.334 --> 00:17:27.134 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: OK.

00:17:27.134 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So the Black church
is different.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:90%
It was different.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:84%
There was no suppression of
hoodoo because the people,

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
the practitioners were also
your pastors and your deacons

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.610 align:middle line:90%
and your mothers of the church.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I would say that more
of the suppression

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
came after Black people
started becoming certified.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
They started going
to theology school.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
That's when you start getting a
little bit more of the prejudice

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:84%
or the bias against
hoodoo practitioners.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.807 align:middle line:84%
But before about
1920, not so much.

00:17:59.807 --> 00:18:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so yeah, that's
what I was reading in your book.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:84%
It was both supported
and then suppressed.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By the churches.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So now you're saying
that's because as they

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:90%
became, as you say, certified.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.197 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Certifiable.

00:18:13.197 --> 00:18:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: And
the Great Migration.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Because now, it's like a
combination of those factors.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.560 align:middle line:90%
So you have people--

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:84%
that you have pastors that are
now going to theology school,

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:90%
they're now going to college.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the problem
gets compacted

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:84%
once a lot of Black Americans
start moving from the South

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and going to the West
Coast and the East Coast.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to look like
country bumpkins anymore.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.190 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
to look primitive.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And these are all the-- this is
the nature of the conversation

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:90%
about Rootwork.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:90%
It's old fashioned at best.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my cousins don't
want to talk about it.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.745 align:middle line:84%
I received death threats
with my first book about it.

00:18:48.745 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.758 align:middle line:84%
People were pissed that
I was talking about it.

00:18:51.758 --> 00:18:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to-- you want
to look sophisticated now.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's trying to blend
into the new quote, "norm."

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Which is a shame.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.033 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Right.

00:19:00.033 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And our pastors
are no different.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:84%
People started moving
away and denying,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.083 align:middle line:90%
and that's what happened.

00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about your grandma,

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.310 align:middle line:84%
what you learned
as a little child,

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:84%
what you observed
and learned, and what

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
was instilled with you from
both sides of the family.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But particularly your
paternal grandmother

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned that would
take you so far as being both

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.938 align:middle line:90%
an academic and a Rootworker.

00:19:21.938 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah, well, my
paternal grandmother passed away

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.152 align:middle line:90%
in 1965, so I never--

00:19:26.152 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you
didn't get to meet her.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So this was all really
an ancestral lineage

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:90%
that you came to know.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:32.872 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Absolutely.

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I look just like her.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:90%
I posted her on Instagram.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:90%
You have to check that out.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:90%
I look just like her.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maybe you are her.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
My father actually said that.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He did?

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:43.627 align:middle line:90%
You're a lot like her?

00:19:43.627 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, Grandma, tell
us all about it firsthand.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: But yeah, she was
accused of being mentally ill,

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
as a lot of spiritual people
were back then and still are,

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, she was
well respected,

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.560 align:middle line:84%
did great work
for the community.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:90%
I really wasn't educated--

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:84%
soul education through her,
but my direct education

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:84%
about Rootwork came from
my maternal grandmother.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's something called
passing the blessing that

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.940 align:middle line:84%
occurs, where you
choose a child to talk

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.110 align:middle line:90%
to about these kind of matters.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
The one that you feel is
the most receptive or--

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Absolutely.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --previously
developed.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes, yes.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:10%
So she felt comfortable
talking to me about it.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:10%
Like I said, I have a
lot of family members

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:10%
that just don't want
to talk about it.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:90%
They want to leave that behind.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was always really
curious about Rootwork.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And she taught me about all the
people that she knew growing up.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:90%
And she used Rootworkers.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I think the last one was a woman
that she just called Mother.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:84%
She passed away in the late
'60s, and she stopped going

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:90%
to practitioners.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Because she couldn't find
anybody real anymore.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: But I've heard--

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I grew up hearing
about those stories.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did your paternal
and maternal grandmothers

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:90%
know each other?

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: They never met.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They never met.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:84%
They weren't in the
same-- yeah, they

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have had reason
to be at that time.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: No.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So you've been tapped
to deliver the blessing.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how old were
you when this happened?

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And how did that take
its course in your life?

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did this surprise
you or you were ready for it?

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: I was always,
I guess, kind of eccentric.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And I used to-- as a child, I
used to go underneath the sink.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And just sit there
for hours, just

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:90%
in the quiet, and just dream.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.920 align:middle line:90%
So I've always been connected.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I remember just trying to just
feel life and understand myself

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.140 align:middle line:84%
as best as I could as a
four-year-old or a five-year-old

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:90%
when I used to do that.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: And there was a
movie called The Autobiography

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.933 align:middle line:84%
of Miss Jane Pittman
that came on one year.

00:21:50.933 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
It used to come on a lot
during Black History Month.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't see it anymore.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's a scene in that
film where there's a Rootworker,

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.210 align:middle line:90%
and she's doing divination.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Cicely Tyson was the
actress for that.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what started
the conversation.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I was fascinated
by what she was doing.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:90%
So you were quite young.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so your
grandmother saw this in you.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So how does the education
begin, then, once you're tapped?

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Just
talking about the past.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Because she didn't
know any-- again,

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.730 align:middle line:84%
she didn't know anyone that
was real past the 1960s.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So she just talked about
the people that she knew.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
She did not consider
herself a Rootworker at all,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:84%
but she respected
it a great deal.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And she told me about our family
members that were practitioners

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.630 align:middle line:90%
and how good they were.

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.730 align:middle line:90%
And I put one in the deck.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Miss Robinson was
actually my cousin.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I grew up on
stories, with stories.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I started doing
more research on my own.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, it's
very, very practical.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Just learning herbs, learning--

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:59.532 align:middle line:90%
Just learning prayer.

00:22:59.532 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she
help you with any

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:90%
of that, the herbs or anything?

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Or did you have to
get that on your own?

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: I had
to get that on my own.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.850 align:middle line:90%
But she knew everything.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:84%
She went to-- we went to Central
Park a lot just to walk around.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And she would know a lot of
the plants that were there.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't recognize the
Latin terms for these plants,

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:84%
or even the layman's
terms for these plants.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:90%
She called them something else.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And one woman,
I'll never forget,

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
the woman said, do you
have a degree in botany?

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said, no,
this is just life.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this came with
her, this understanding

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.320 align:middle line:84%
of plants and their healing
capacities with humans.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But then you went ahead
and studied it further

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.528 align:middle line:90%
when you were creating the deck.

00:23:41.528 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Absolutely, yeah.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how did that
come about, in terms of--

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:84%
like, I drew a card that
was the Four of Sticks.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
into the suites.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I drew
a Four of Sticks

00:23:54.715 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:90%
that has Angelica with it.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.230 align:middle line:84%
How did you associate
these attributes?

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take that card,
the attributes of that card,

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:90%
with Angelica root.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:90%
How did this?

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Well, Angelica
root is associated with love.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And the image on
the card is a couple

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
burying the placenta
of their child

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:84%
underneath the tree, which is
the ultimate symbol of love

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:90%
and protection.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So I associated different--
the properties of the herbs

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:90%
with the message in the card.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these herbs,
they have maybe two or three

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:30.525 align:middle line:90%
meanings, if not more.

00:24:30.525 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: So I just had to
pick the one that I wanted--

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Most closely relates.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.313 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Or I just wanted--
or just the one that I wanted

00:24:37.313 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:84%
to emphasize for that
particular message.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.025 align:middle line:84%
Because it does require some
intuitive work on your part,

00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:90%
along with knowledge.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you're marrying.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about the deck itself.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:90%
I had fun playing with it.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And I just got in a very
clear space and said,

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, show me the now of
whomever I'm asking about.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And I would just get
calm and chose one

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
for a friend, one for
her fiance, one for me

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.610 align:middle line:90%
and a couple other people.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.095 align:middle line:84%
But they were
astoundingly right on.

00:25:09.095 --> 00:25:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, part of that is because I
was in a calm space and drawing.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But part of it,
it was the clarity

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:84%
of the card itself to explain
these situations people were in.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.180 align:middle line:90%
And not all of them were easy.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.167 align:middle line:90%
Some were challenging.

00:25:19.167 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Right.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the cards in the suites

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.988 align:middle line:84%
because they differ a little
bit from standard tarot.

00:25:24.988 --> 00:25:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Absolutely.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, this deck is modeled off
of the ideal nuclear family,

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:90%
pre-industrial nuclear family.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
the ideal family then?

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: I mean, you
have your extended family

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:90%
and community.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Black Americans have always
been multigenerational-focused,

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:90%
where you have Big Mama.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Your grandmother was the leader.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:90%
So the hoodoo tarot reflects--

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
always matriarchal?

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.675 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Always, as
Indigenous Americans are

00:25:56.675 --> 00:25:57.475 align:middle line:90%
matriarchal.

00:25:57.475 --> 00:25:58.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:58.275 --> 00:26:00.528 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: And
that's the difference.

00:26:00.528 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the key
difference with the hoodoo

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.370 align:middle line:90%
tarot.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, the sun and
most European cultures are--

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:90%
is associated with masculinity.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.210 align:middle line:84%
But in my deck, it
is a feminine card.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And the moon is a
masculine card in my deck.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, yes.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: So we also don't
have the aristocracy or medieval

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.970 align:middle line:84%
or Renaissance images because
it's an American deck.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So I have the elders
as the Major Arcana

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:84%
because they're the repository
of wisdom and tradition

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:90%
in any culture.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the family,
which is the court cards.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So you have the mother,
the father, the daughter

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:90%
and the son.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And so what are the four--

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.483 align:middle line:90%
there are sticks and--

00:26:44.483 --> 00:26:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Baskets.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Baskets.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: And coins.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Coins.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: And knives.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.887 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And knives, right.

00:26:49.887 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting,
I just want

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.100 align:middle line:84%
to add a little something
in here because it's

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.220 align:middle line:90%
coming back around again.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.510 align:middle line:90%
It's going to come around.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is these
matriarchal lineages,

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:84%
they were matriarchal
for a reason.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a clear understanding
that the female and the male

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.590 align:middle line:84%
had very different attributes
and gifts to offer.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:84%
But when it came to
community and having

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.480 align:middle line:84%
to heal and advise and
keep a community healthy,

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:90%
that it was the feminine--

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
the feminine mind.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And now, neuroscience is
beginning to understand this--

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and prove it and
map it out on MRIs--

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.900 align:middle line:84%
that the female brain
is uniquely wired

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:84%
so that it can communicate
very rapidly between the two

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.240 align:middle line:84%
hemispheres for both logic
and intuition simultaneously.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which it sets it
up ideally for leadership.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And that you have
to have leadership

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:90%
in a tribe or a family.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
There has to be someone who
can make these clear decisions

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
for the best of all,
where the men are very

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.550 align:middle line:84%
endowed with the ability to take
something forward, go for it

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and manifest it,
take it to completion

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.110 align:middle line:90%
in a very targeted way.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And the female's energy is
more diffused toward the tribe

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:90%
or family.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense that they
were matrilineal naturally,

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:90%
or matriarchal naturally.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're starting
to discover this again.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:15.710 align:middle line:90%
So it'll be interesting.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Wow.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.072 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It'll be
interesting to see

00:28:18.072 --> 00:28:20.423 align:middle line:84%
what happens with
leadership around the world.

00:28:20.423 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It's totally
appropriate for women

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:90%
to be in leadership positions.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.900 align:middle line:84%
It's natural to us to be
in leadership positions.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: It's
going to take a lot.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's going
to take a little time.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.518 align:middle line:84%
Just like everything
else is taking time.

00:28:30.518 --> 00:28:34.930 align:middle line:84%
So how would a person,
then, use the deck,

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.060 align:middle line:84%
begin interfacing with
your deck and using it?

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.290 align:middle line:90%
You've got a wonderful book.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And then it sets--

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.190 align:middle line:84%
everything we've talked
about, sets it up.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And then it explains
each of the cards.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So how would you
approach it initially?

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And how do you lay the deck
out uniquely to your cards?

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: I think that the
best way to learn any deck is

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:90%
to do a card of the day.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Just pull one card
in the morning

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:90%
or one card in the evening.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It depends on who
you are, right?

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, you
may want some insight

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:90%
into what may occur that day.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Or you may want to reflect
on what happened that day.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a very personal
way to get to know tarot.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, read the book
and read the definitions,

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:90%
but don't get locked in.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Look at the image and see
what jumps out at you.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It may be something that's
in the background that

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:90%
means something.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to be
the one to read the cards.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So create a personal
relationship with the cards.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:84%
That's how I learned
tarot back in the '90s.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.168 align:middle line:90%
I just took a Rider-Waite deck--

00:29:41.168 --> 00:29:42.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the classic.

00:29:42.335 --> 00:29:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: The classic, yeah.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.360 align:middle line:90%
I love it, love it, love it.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: And I wrote down
how I felt about the card.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I read the
descriptions in the books.

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.263 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were they
usually validated?

00:29:56.263 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did you
usually find there

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.720 align:middle line:84%
was some similarity
between how you felt

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and what the explanation
for the card was?

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Sometimes.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's really
important that we put our own--

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: You have to.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --feelings
and meanings into it.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And not just, I
didn't like tarot

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.570 align:middle line:84%
because I don't like
seeing these cards of death

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:90%
and destruction and everything.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.785 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to see that
card show up in front of me.

00:30:16.785 --> 00:30:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah, The
Tower is usually a problem.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I didn't--

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:84%
yeah, The Tower is a problem,
and I didn't understand.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.870 align:middle line:90%
It just, like, creeped me out.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So I just avoided
decks entirely.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.815 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Oh, no!

00:30:25.815 --> 00:30:26.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:30:26.615 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will
not play with tarot

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.703 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want to
see the negative imagery.

00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: But it
doesn't have to be.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.378 align:middle line:84%
Because The Tower, you
see this lightning bolt.

00:30:35.378 --> 00:30:36.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what I used to focus on.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Not so much the people
falling out of the window.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I focused on the lightning
and that flash of inspiration.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:44.810 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I think it depends
on if you're more

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:90%
of an optimist or a pessimist.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm an
optimist, but I didn't

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:90%
like those negative images.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.240 align:middle line:90%
And so I stayed away from it.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.745 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't let people
do tarot readings for me.

00:30:56.745 --> 00:30:57.545 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: OK.

00:30:57.545 --> 00:30:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's only
been very recently.

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.372 align:middle line:84%
Someone that's a very close
friend, someone I interview

00:31:01.372 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:84%
on this show, who draws
cards from the deck.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.650 align:middle line:90%
You spoke of the common deck.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.287 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every single morning.

00:31:06.287 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'd come down for tea.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:90%
And she'd start drawing cards.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, do we have to do this?

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I started seeing
how she did it, and said,

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.330 align:middle line:84%
don't worry about this
upside down stuff.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about this.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.163 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The upside down thing.

00:31:18.163 --> 00:31:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to be
so rigid about it, right?

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: I've
never done reversals.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: It didn't
feel natural for me.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been read by people that
use reversals and the readings

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:90%
came out fantastic.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.480 align:middle line:90%
I just don't like it.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Again, you just have to go
with what you feel, you know?

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I know when
something's not right.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't need it to be reversed.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.040 align:middle line:84%
There are usually a
lot more indicators

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.638 align:middle line:90%
that something is not for me.

00:31:48.638 --> 00:31:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times,
things are not bad.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:90%
They're just not for you.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:52.800 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're using it
as divination, some people--

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.820 align:middle line:84%
like me, it doesn't
matter if it's astrology

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:84%
or what, I tend to go out
and blast through life,

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.760 align:middle line:84%
make my own decisions,
my own mistakes.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I look at
it in hindsight.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of--

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's fun.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I'll think, God, what was
happening during that period?

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:11.920 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
about the notion

00:32:13.548 --> 00:32:16.900 align:middle line:84%
that if you use divination
for future pacing,

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that you're kind of maybe
programming yourself?

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Or how do you feel about that?

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Well, I don't see
it as a fortune-telling tool.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:84%
It's like a probability
tool, right?

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.282 align:middle line:84%
It's no different than
watching the news.

00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:31.215 align:middle line:90%
It may rain.

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:32.760 align:middle line:90%
I may see that.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it doesn't.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.520 align:middle line:90%
But why not bring an umbrella?

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
yeah, that's true.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: I just don't
think of it that way.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.070 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
a wonderful tool

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:48.910 align:middle line:84%
just to get a gauge
of what is possible.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:50.813 align:middle line:84%
And there are infinite
possibilities.

00:32:50.813 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to-- you can
make a different choice.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.720 align:middle line:84%
If you see that, I don't know,
you're going on a job interview,

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:90%
you pull a card and it sucks.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: OK.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Why does it suck?

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.830 align:middle line:84%
What can you do to
make it suck less?

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR:
That's how I use it.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.040 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that you're
not going to get the job.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But maybe there's something
that you're missing.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.438 align:middle line:90%
And that's what--

00:33:12.438 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe you need to
be extra alert or whatever.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Or
change your outfit.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or change your outfit.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.403 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, something like that.

00:33:17.403 --> 00:33:20.203 align:middle line:84%
So you have used it throughout
your lifetime, I assume.

00:33:20.203 --> 00:33:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes,
since the '90s.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even
on a daily basis.

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
exactly what you do,

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.385 align:middle line:84%
if you have a unique opportunity
coming up or whatnot.

00:33:29.385 --> 00:33:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, now you're out there.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You've got this beautiful
book and deck out there.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So how did that show
itself in the cards

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:39.320 align:middle line:84%
to you, that you would be out
there promoting this and making

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.930 align:middle line:84%
this your life's work after
your educational background?

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Besides death
threats and all that.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:45.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: I wanted to teach
people that we have a culture

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.090 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:84%
We have a spiritual
tradition here.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the reason why I
wrote my first book on Rootwork,

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.270 align:middle line:84%
because the emphasis is usually
on Africa and the Caribbean

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:03.280 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to Black
people having a philosophy,

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.070 align:middle line:90%
having a way.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted people to know
that we have that right here

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.120 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.230 align:middle line:90%
It's unique to us.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:84%
It's unique to just
our experiences here.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's worthy of knowing.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I pull cards,
or I used to pull cards,

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I used to get those
cards that you dreaded.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:24.399 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew there
would be pushback.

00:34:24.399 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Because our
tradition was pretty much

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.560 align:middle line:84%
classified just as
Negro superstition.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to be taken seriously.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
knew you were going

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.679 align:middle line:90%
to be up against a challenge.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Oh, yeah.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:35.110 align:middle line:90%
And I was ready for it.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still ready for it.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how is it in
dealing with other Black

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Americans who have said, I want
to get as far away from any

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.380 align:middle line:90%
of those roots as possible?

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Are you able to get
through-- and that includes

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:90%
all populations, really.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's just trying to blend
and almost stereotype themselves

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:90%
into what the ideal is today.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.210 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Can you get through
pretty easily

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:84%
to other Black
Americans who have

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.180 align:middle line:90%
left this rich history behind?

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: I'm
not interested.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested in trying
to convince anyone of anything.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I spoke to the
descendant of Dr. buzzard.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Buzzard was a really
famous practitioner.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.150 align:middle line:84%
In the standard deck,
it would be Justice.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But in my deck,
it's Dr. Buzzard.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And his descendant,
she's passed now.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.760 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to her in
like 2017, 2018.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And she said, there's
nothing to chase.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.180 align:middle line:90%
There's no one to convince.

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I asked her, what do
you think of this reclamation

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.400 align:middle line:90%
of the culture?

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.870 align:middle line:90%
And she said, it's ridiculous.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:39.930 align:middle line:84%
It's meant to die in
certain people's bloodline.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:90%
She felt that it's died in her.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.753 align:middle line:90%
She had eight children.

00:35:43.753 --> 00:35:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: And
she said, it's OK.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:50.210 align:middle line:84%
We've served the
community for centuries.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:53.040 align:middle line:84%
It's time for someone
else to serve.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- this
kind of empowerment,

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:59.050 align:middle line:90%
that's not what this is about.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's time
to pass the torch.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm not looking
to recruit or convince.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.390 align:middle line:84%
The people that gravitate
towards the tradition

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:10.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's either
in their lineage

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.900 align:middle line:84%
or because they
just feel like it's

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.430 align:middle line:84%
time for us, for our
tradition, to make a comeback,

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:20.560 align:middle line:84%
or at least be part of
the cultural conversation

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:84%
in terms of spirituality,
that's what it's all about.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested
in proselytizing.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
really brilliant of you

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.900 align:middle line:84%
to have chosen this
path and to do it

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:84%
in such an articulate
and beautiful way,

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.180 align:middle line:84%
weave this back in where
the bulk of the population

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.127 align:middle line:84%
is getting their information
and their cues from media.

00:36:42.127 --> 00:36:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Right.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which isn't
serving us any longer.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know your
views on that, but--

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
think it's serving us

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.740 align:middle line:84%
any longer, the vast
majority of media.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
I've had conversations

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:84%
with people about AI
and you don't even

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.750 align:middle line:90%
know what's real anymore.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't know what
was real before that.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: That's right.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The media was always
skewed from the very beginning.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: 100%.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Always editorializing,
though, pretending to be--

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Objective, yeah.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:06.683 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Objective.

00:37:06.683 --> 00:37:08.560 align:middle line:84%
It never has really,
truly been objective.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: No.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, how
do we find our truth?

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.030 align:middle line:84%
How do we learn about
the intuition and beauty

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.210 align:middle line:90%
that lives within us?

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.460 align:middle line:84%
It seems like that's what
you're trying to bring back.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yes, I'm trying
to get to bring back the basics.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah go back to Mother wit.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Go back to Father wit.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Go back to your grandparents
and find nuggets of truth

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:84%
there in your tangible
bloodline ancestry.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody's kind of
exotifying and commodifying

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.150 align:middle line:90%
the exotic.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- especially
Americans, in my opinion,

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.582 align:middle line:84%
after reading people
for a long time.

00:37:45.582 --> 00:37:48.123 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've been reading
people from all over the world?

00:37:48.123 --> 00:37:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah, it's
really a problem here.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's a weird
low self-esteem, I think,

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that Americans have--
of all colors--

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.600 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have
anything here.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:04.300 align:middle line:84%
We always have to go out there,
to find culture, to find depth.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.298 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:05.298 --> 00:38:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: It's weird.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember reading
a large study on this.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:10.600 align:middle line:90%
It's been years now.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could draw it all
up on exactly what you're

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.290 align:middle line:84%
talking about, about the low
self-esteem among Americans.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And could it be
that because we're constantly

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.390 align:middle line:84%
being preached at
to reach some sort

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.730 align:middle line:84%
of ideal, standard
or exalted state

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and never being accepted
for what we actually

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.510 align:middle line:90%
are, that that's created it?

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: It's possible,
but it could be just the way we

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:90%
began.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we just discussed,
indentured servants, slaves.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And these are not glamorous
stories, you know?

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:45.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's like--

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Reprobates
like my family.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.616 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah, that's--

00:38:49.616 --> 00:38:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that gives people a lot of
people a sense of shame.

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
that's reinforced

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:57.840 align:middle line:90%
by the church, of course.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.773 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To feel
ashamed of ourselves

00:38:59.773 --> 00:39:00.990 align:middle line:90%
because we're a lesser than.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: So
it's all compounded.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's just crusty
at this point.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
trying to get across

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.720 align:middle line:84%
is that we have
a tradition here.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:90%
We have a history.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.630 align:middle line:90%
We all have our own histories.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.890 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
your ethnicity is,

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:21.520 align:middle line:84%
there are powerful
ancestors in your bloodline.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.070 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, you
have your deck you have,

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.030 align:middle line:84%
which is based on the
playing cards of past times.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you have
another guest of ours here,

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and a friend, Robert Kemp, who
wrote the love cards and destiny

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:37.110 align:middle line:90%
cards.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.652 align:middle line:84%
All of that's based
on playing cards.

00:39:38.652 --> 00:39:39.452 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:39:39.452 --> 00:39:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
coming back full on.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:43.320 align:middle line:84%
People are fascinated
with this again.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So these systems are-- that old
systems are starting to emerge.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a very ancient
system before Egypt.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's absolutely fascinating.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing is, seems
to me, keeping right in step

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.340 align:middle line:84%
with the times and what
we need now to get real,

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.760 align:middle line:84%
to discover who we are,
to know ourselves better.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: And accept
ourselves honestly and wholly.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.340 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:09.000 align:middle line:10%
And to change the narrative
that America is just,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.990 align:middle line:10%
like, a soulless place, that
you just come just to make money

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:15.490 align:middle line:10%
or-- there's a soul here.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: An old soul.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.990 align:middle line:90%
We have the oldest--

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:23.020 align:middle line:84%
one of the oldest mountain
ranges in the world.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't people
making pilgrimages here

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:27.862 align:middle line:90%
to our National Parks?

00:40:27.862 --> 00:40:28.662 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:28.662 --> 00:40:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And very ancient
Indigenous populations.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah!

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very, very ancient.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're not just going
back a few thousand years.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.218 align:middle line:84%
We just scratched the
surface, going back

00:40:36.218 --> 00:40:37.620 align:middle line:84%
to when the settlers
came and met

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.910 align:middle line:90%
the existing Native populations.

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:41.507 align:middle line:90%
That was the end of the line.

00:40:41.507 --> 00:40:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>> MCQUILLAR: And the
cities that they demolished.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.158 align:middle line:90%
Cities they demolished.

00:40:45.158 --> 00:40:46.170 align:middle line:90%
So much more to learn.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.263 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I-- any final
thoughts before we say goodbye?

00:40:49.263 --> 00:40:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
that you're bringing

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.420 align:middle line:84%
all this back, this
rich body of work,

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.220 align:middle line:84%
to help people find a
richness to themselves again.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Yeah.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say, just
be proud to be an American.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Because we're being
made to feel like we're

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.522 align:middle line:84%
the naughty people
on the planet.

00:41:05.522 --> 00:41:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: Oh, yeah.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.660 align:middle line:90%
But a lot of people have--

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.130 align:middle line:84%
we have some interesting
histories there.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.065 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not just us.

00:41:13.065 --> 00:41:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not just us.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:15.877 align:middle line:90%
>> MCQUILLAR: It's not just us.

00:41:15.877 --> 00:41:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tayannah,
thank you so much.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.793 align:middle line:90%
It's been absolutely delightful.

00:41:18.793 --> 00:41:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
