>>REGINA MEREDITH: We're
happy to have with us again

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:84%
an audience favorite,
Jerry Wills.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to be
talking about ghostbusting.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
We're bathed in a
multidimensional reality that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:90%
brings in its light and dark.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Jerry shares the dynamics of
interfacing with these worlds,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and also how to stop
any interference.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:84%
We'll also both be telling
some ghostly stories.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.484 align:middle line:10%
Welcome again, Jerry.

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:10%
It's always a pleasure
to have you here.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:10%
Everybody around says, oh, gosh.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
When Jerry walks through
the room, I feel so calm.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.820 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know, at the expense of
maybe boring a few viewers that

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:84%
already know this story, but
I want to just say it again,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:84%
I first heard about you 30
years ago from a friend.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was out on a
book tour in Phoenix,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:90%
and she met you in Phoenix.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And you happened to be
there at their book signing,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and it had to do with the
subject of channeling.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And she called me
right after and said,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:84%
you have to meet this
man, Jerry Wills.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.805 align:middle line:90%
Regina, he's a real ET.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:90%
And she said, no, I'm serious.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:84%
He was looking one
way, and his other face

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:90%
would turn and smile at me.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
She said, it happened
more than one time.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:90%
It happened twice.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So of course, as time went
on, I did meet you finally

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:84%
a number of years
ago, and it turns out,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:90%
well, I guess you're an ET.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So you came in loaded with all
kinds of talents and skills

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.564 align:middle line:84%
that not everybody has, but that
maybe lie latent in us, right?

00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JERRY WILLS: Mm-hmm.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.112 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is the
ability to see into the realms

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:90%
where other beings are.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:84%
But also, you have a
particular kind of courage

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.305 align:middle line:90%
in interfacing with them.

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
afraid of ghosts,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're not
scared of nothing.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, not much.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I don't like spiders.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm with you on that one.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, I
don't like spiders.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I scream like a
girl, and you probably do too.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I do.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of spiders too.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have
histories there.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.849 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's
talk about the FOX TV

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
show you were on,
because they came to you.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
They knew about--
a lot of TV shows

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.955 align:middle line:84%
have come to you because
they know about you,

00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and about ghostbusting
up in the fun, artistic,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and kind of creepy
little town of Jerome.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.441 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
outside of Cottonwood,

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:90%
outside of Sedona in Arizona.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, just west
of Sedona, about 20 miles,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:90%
25 miles.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.735 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, they
were wanting to do,

00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
of course, as they do every
year, a Halloween special.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
to do it up in Jerome,

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's where Kathy
and I were living.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So you know, they got a
hold of me, Rod Haberer,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:90%
the news director.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And they came up,
started shooting

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:90%
around different things.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
They were doing different
elements of different stories

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:90%
in different places.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
this was, can you

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
show us a place that
you think is haunted?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.369 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Jerome, you
just look around.

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every place is.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.865 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: --and point.

00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a ghost town.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.315 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It is.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:90%
How about if we do it this way?

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
How about if I take you to a
place I know is really haunted,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.972 align:middle line:84%
and then I have you
have an experience.

00:03:28.972 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:84%
They thought that was
great, because they

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:90%
hadn't had any experiences.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It was all anecdotal,
the people that they

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:90%
had been interviewing.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this happened
and that happened.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So we went up to what
is the old hospital.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And some people
call it the asylum.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
The asylum was really
the basement part

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
where people who
could not be fixed

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:90%
were put until they expired.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole other story
about what was going on.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.622 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there was
also copper mining going on.

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, there
was a big copper mine.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And copper
mining toxicity

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.456 align:middle line:84%
literally drives you mad,
the toxicity to the brain.

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So of course, there
had to be an asylum

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.322 align:middle line:84%
to accompany the natural
fallout from doing that job.

00:04:12.322 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But you know,
with the mining company,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:84%
if someone got
hurt or disfigured,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
especially disfigured, they
would not let them loose.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.840 align:middle line:84%
They would put
them in the asylum.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't want people
seeing a disfigured person

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:84%
wandering around going,
yeah, I got like this

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:90%
because I got hurt in the mine.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Bad PR.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So a lot of people
would end up that way.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:90%
So I took them to this place.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And they have the
little meters, you

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:84%
know, like "Ghostbusters,"
and little things

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:84%
just sort of blooping
a little bit.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Come over here next
to this power outlet,

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and find out what the
power outlet does.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people
make the mistake

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that a little electromagnetic
blip is a ghost.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not always.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Got around the power outlet.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Thing's just going
crazy periodically.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.745 align:middle line:84%
I said, now that's what a
power outlet looks like.

00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to show
you what it's like when

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.877 align:middle line:90%
a ghost interfaces with it.

00:05:13.877 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Now for a lot of
people, they're going

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to think this is a
little far-fetched,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.550 align:middle line:90%
but this is what happened.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.840 align:middle line:90%
They have it on camera.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
It was on their Halloween
thing a couple of years ago.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We went to the
place where I knew

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
that there was going
to be a presence,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.585 align:middle line:84%
but I really didn't know
what the presence was.

00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't looked into it.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:90%
It didn't matter to me.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:90%
I lived close to it.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And in this place, there
are a number of entities,

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.377 align:middle line:90%
especially if you go inside.

00:05:42.377 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And they have it sealed
so you can't get in there.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.043 align:middle line:84%
They won't let people
in there because

00:05:46.043 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:90%
of what happens after dark.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it turns out,
there was this ghost

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:84%
of this caretaker
that showed up.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a little
conversation with him.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how about
if we show them--

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:84%
the crew was, like, over
here, looking on their own

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:90%
for a ghost.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:90%
I'll call them when it's ready.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:90%
So he says, you know--

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't have a
problem with it.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I call him over, and
he's standing, like,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:90%
in this one particular spot.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And I had them take the
meters, and sure enough, they

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.910 align:middle line:90%
would start picking it up.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So I had him go over
here to the left

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and do the same thing again,
and there was nothing there.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.234 align:middle line:84%
So I asked him, the ghost,
to go over there and stand.

00:06:33.234 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
He did, and they start
picking it up over there now.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, now you know
that there's something.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
experience what

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.079 align:middle line:90%
it feels like to feel a ghost?

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Because they're already
very excited that they're

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:84%
detecting a ghost and
this little experiment

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:90%
had gone this far.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
teach that I have not really

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:84%
taught many people is
how to send energy.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Because working as a
healer in any capacity,

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:90%
you're sending energy.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:90%
You're using energy to do this.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the same in any
of the psychic arts.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:84%
So I would send energy to this
ghost and power him up so he

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
would become more manifest,
and then they could sense that

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.900 align:middle line:90%
without the meters.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
exactly happened.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I sent the energy
to this fellow.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:90%
He was happy about it.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:84%
He became sort of there in a
heat-wavy-looking capacity.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And I had these guys run
their hands through him,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and it was ice cold
right where he was.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So they felt that they had
really gotten a great story.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And I thanked the ghost man.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Then we left.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
end of that story.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I guess they aired it
and it was a big hit.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm
I'm sure it was.

00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, there are
a lot of ghosts in Jerome.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:90%
There are.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting,
you mentioned

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that you had them measure
where the ghost was next

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.807 align:middle line:90%
to the electrical socket, right?

00:08:06.807 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No, no, no.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.110 align:middle line:84%
The electrical
socket was, like--

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.984 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Over there.

00:08:09.984 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:90%
You measured that.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So you measured
that, and then you

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.782 align:middle line:84%
measured the ghost separately
from the electrical socket.

00:08:14.782 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I had them go all
the way around this building

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:90%
that they can get to.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So that they would
have, like, a baseline.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And then when they had
the baseline figured out,

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
then I took the next step,
and then they could actually

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.800 align:middle line:90%
detect where a ghost might be.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.308 align:middle line:84%
Well, that will make
this a non sequitur,

00:08:34.308 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:84%
but we might as well
just do it now anyway.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you know who
Andrea Perron is?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.025 align:middle line:84%
The films "The Conjuring"
were based on her.

00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, I've
heard of those.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.608 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, they were
somewhat fictitionalized,

00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
but they were based on her
family's home and experience.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:90%
And yikes.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I did three interviews
with Andrea about this.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But one thing she said is that
when the ghost would really amp

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.600 align:middle line:84%
up and start causing the kind
of trouble they were causing--

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and some of it
was pretty nasty--

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:84%
that their electric
meter was just--

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSHING]

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.330 align:middle line:84%
--spinning, and that
their electric bills

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:84%
just soared during
the periods where

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:90%
the ghosts were manifesting.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So can you explain
how they're working

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:84%
with the electrical
field at large,

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.725 align:middle line:84%
and then also your actual
electrical power source

00:09:21.725 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:90%
so they can power up?

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's not like I can
give you an absolute on this,

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:84%
but what I've seen
and experienced,

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:84%
these entities pull energy from
whatever they can pull it from.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
A good example of that,
a person is being--

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:84%
let's just call it
haunted, whatever

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:90%
the real term might be.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But let's just call it
haunted, because everyone

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:90%
understands what that means.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:84%
When they're coming
up and going,

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:84%
you know, boo, and you're
just getting really afraid,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.265 align:middle line:84%
you're letting off
a lot of energy.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And when that energy
is being released,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.260 align:middle line:90%
it's going to this entity.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:90%
They're just pulling it.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:84%
When that first starts
happening for them,

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
they learn very quickly that all
I have to do is to rattle you,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:90%
and they get some more energy.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Their desire is to
be able to interface

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:84%
with this world the way
they once had done so.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're frustrated, because
they have no one to talk to.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:84%
They can't do much to
affect this world at all,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
except just be a presence
that frightens you.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know what
to do about themselves

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and the position
that they're in.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So if they can frighten you,
then they can pull in energy.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, energy is energy.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.860 align:middle line:84%
The energy running
through any person's body

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.670 align:middle line:90%
is electrical energy.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you're frightened,

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.870 align:middle line:84%
you're really
putting wattage out.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say, I feel
fried after a frightful event.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah,
that's exactly right.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.859 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So with a house
and an electrical system,

00:10:57.859 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
you have electricity going
in through the meters,

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.816 align:middle line:90%
through all the wires.

00:11:00.816 --> 00:11:04.400 align:middle line:84%
The wires in the house, if you
think of it like a huge network

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:84%
of a very long antenna, and
the field around these wires

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:90%
is a measurable field.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
That's why they have
electromagnetic meters,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.400 align:middle line:90%
the little "Ghostbuster" meters.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And getting a background on what
the residual electromagnetic

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.662 align:middle line:84%
field is all about
will tell you when

00:11:24.662 --> 00:11:26.495 align:middle line:84%
there's something that's
different in there,

00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and there's some
anomaly occurring.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So consequently, the presence
of these beings pulling

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.770 align:middle line:90%
energy from any resource--

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.179 align:middle line:90%
it can be your pet--

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
all it does is gives
them the ability

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.449 align:middle line:90%
to get a little closer--

00:11:43.449 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To manifest more
directly into our dimension.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Exactly.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
You can't imagine
how much of a thrill

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.440 align:middle line:84%
it probably gives them to be
able to manifest to the point

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.170 align:middle line:84%
that they can knock
over a coffee cup.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Did it!

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.350 align:middle line:90%
They can hear me.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
about during, for example,

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:90%
electrical storms?

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, yeah.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Big time.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.602 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they tend to try to
manifest during those periods?

00:12:09.602 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's usually--
electrical storms

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of potential.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And the atmosphere
has, of course,

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.510 align:middle line:84%
a higher potential
of energy available.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:26.680 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know that they
look to that as a main resource

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:90%
for getting their power.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine, if
you're in a haunted house

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and there's an electrical
storm, it's the whole classic,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.565 align:middle line:90%
you know, black and white movie.

00:12:37.565 --> 00:12:38.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yippie!

00:12:38.365 --> 00:12:39.165 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Ah!

00:12:39.165 --> 00:12:40.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:84%
The electrical storm gives
them a little bit of a charge.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:90%
They can do a little bit more.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
person getting scared.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot more of a
resource for energy, really.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
It makes for good, you
know, B-grade films.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:54.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's take you back a little
bit where this all began.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.852 align:middle line:90%
And then also Aunt Betty.

00:12:59.852 --> 00:13:00.776 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, yeah.

00:13:00.776 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:90%
That.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.092 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:13:05.092 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
wired differently.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.133 align:middle line:84%
You came in seeing
things differently.

00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:09.025 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:13:09.025 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that wants
to know about Jerry,

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.441 align:middle line:84%
you can watch my other
interviews with him.

00:13:12.441 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
It explains how you
began your life here.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And they're
all quite good.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.590 align:middle line:90%
I've seen them.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:90%
They're good.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So if you haven't
watched them, you should.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're good.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:90%
It explains who you are.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.893 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say
you're wired differently.

00:13:23.893 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I'm wired differently.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that I
was any different, you know?

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while
to figure that out.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:84%
What happened with my
Aunt Betty was just

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:84%
another in these
series of weird things

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.020 align:middle line:90%
that was occurring for me.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
By this time, I had
already been chastised

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
to the point where I
was a little hesitant

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:84%
to make much of a wave about
what I was experiencing.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But I'd had this dream, which
was actually quite a vision

00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:02.350 align:middle line:84%
that my Aunt Betty had come
to me and said, I have died.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And she gave me these things,
these instructions that I was

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:90%
supposed to get to her husband.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And she was adamant about it.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And of course, here I am, a kid,
as my Aunt Betty's telling me,

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:90%
you need to do this.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I'm going to do
what she requested, and I'm not

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.155 align:middle line:84%
going to keep it to
myself, even though I'm

00:14:26.155 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
going to be chastised
by somebody, I'm sure.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:90%
But I'd gotten a directive.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:90%
So I try to tell--

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
well, before I get
to that point--

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I woke up the next morning to a
bit of clamour and loud talking

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:90%
in the kitchen.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:84%
My mom was on the phone
to her sister, Louise.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to call the
brother, Harry, because Betty

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:90%
had died that night.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to
go from central Kentucky

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:10.170 align:middle line:84%
all the way to Denver to
help Jimmy, Betty's husband.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:90%
And he had three kids.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:90%
Three-- four kids.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:90%
So they were going to just--

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:84%
had to get it together
very quickly and go.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it wasn't
a big surprise to me,

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.650 align:middle line:84%
because I'd had dreams like
this before, and it was always,

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.850 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.894 align:middle line:84%
well, the only person that
I had any contact with that

00:15:29.894 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:84%
would actually sit
down and listen to me

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:90%
was Harry, my Uncle Harry.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He believed you.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, because I would
tell him who was going to win

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
the Kentucky Derby,
and who was going to--

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did Uncle Harry bet?

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.616 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I don't know.

00:15:45.616 --> 00:15:46.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:50.386 align:middle line:84%
I suspect he did, because
he had a nice house,

00:15:50.386 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and he didn't need to work.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
his little lucky charm.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I suppose.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But he was always asking,
who's going to do this?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So how does Uncle
Harry figure into--

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming he has to deliver
this message to Uncle Jimmy.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, Yes.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Harry took the message to
Jimmy, and it wasn't really

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:90%
very well-received.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.605 align:middle line:84%
Harry tried to validate
it, of course, saying--

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My horse came in.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
The kid knows what
he's talking about.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Every time, he tells me
exactly who's going to do what.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know, of course,
Jimmy just lost his wife.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:32.155 align:middle line:84%
And Jimmy is an alcoholic
beyond extraordinary, about as

00:16:32.155 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:90%
bad an alcoholic as you can be.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:90%
So he doesn't just drink.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.642 align:middle line:84%
He gets completely
sloshed, and he's

00:16:39.642 --> 00:16:41.100 align:middle line:84%
not listening to
any of this stuff,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and becomes belligerent
when he gets that way.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's, like, a pointless
thing to even try

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
to talk to him about
this, I suppose.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:53.310 align:middle line:90%
When my mom got back--

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
of course, I talked
to Uncle Harry.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.670 align:middle line:90%
He just says, no.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:90%
He won't want to hear it.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
She again warned me
that I wasn't supposed

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:07.349 align:middle line:84%
to be talking about such things
as this, that it wasn't well

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.349 align:middle line:84%
received, although she used
a bit stronger terminology

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And that I should avoid
that kind of conversation.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.839 align:middle line:90%
I'm paraphrasing, of course.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:19.639 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:17:19.639 --> 00:17:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.032 align:middle line:84%
So did you end up
kind of keeping things

00:17:24.032 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
to yourself a little
bit more after that?

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, I always did.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.645 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: You know, I mean,
you figure when your aunt dies

00:17:29.645 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:90%
and she shows up and says--

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.031 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell Jimmy this,
and they don't listen.

00:17:33.031 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:90%
What's the point, right?

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
a non sequitur.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Your adoptive parents,
how tall are they?

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, they're just,
they were small people.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did anyone wonder why
you came out six foot 8", where

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:90%
you were from or anything?

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Because you had to have
had an early growth spurt.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: That was something that
was kept such a secret, even

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:90%
to this day.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the family never--
the rest of the family never

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:90%
knew about your circumstances?

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, the whole
family knew about it.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: All the
women in the family

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.510 align:middle line:84%
had been exposed to radium
when they were children,

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.630 align:middle line:90%
and it sterilized them.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was funny
to put it on their teeth.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, God.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Glowing in the dark.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, God.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.308 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And they didn't
know that it was radioactive

00:18:16.308 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and that it would
sterilize them.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So all of the sisters
had been exposed

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.740 align:middle line:90%
and couldn't have children.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So all of them either
had no children or one.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And actually, as I'm thinking
about it, there's only one

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:90%
of the sisters that had a child.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:90%
Only one.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And yours adopted you.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.493 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mm-hmm.

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:90%
That's just kind of interesting.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.138 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
imagine what people

00:18:45.138 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:84%
must have thought
as you kept growing

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.180 align:middle line:90%
and growing, and growing.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, it was a strange
thing for me, because you know,

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.200 align:middle line:84%
these folks were
nothing like me.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.790 align:middle line:90%
No, they wouldn't be.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:58.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to-- that's
in the other interviews,

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
entities themselves.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:90%
So someone passes over.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
You have sort of an astral
form, but you have a soul.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
differentiation between these,

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and what happens in
the first few days

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
after death, which they're
very available at that time,

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and then after that
first week or so.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I've
been with several people

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:84%
before they passed over
and after they passed over.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And in every case of these
folks-- because I have clients

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.442 align:middle line:84%
I deal with a lot of people,
and many of them are quite ill,

00:19:37.442 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and some of them aren't
going to make it,

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.814 align:middle line:84%
and I help them
with that as well.

00:19:40.814 --> 00:19:42.105 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what to expect.

00:19:42.105 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:84%
When a person gets to the point
where they're going to die,

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.270 align:middle line:90%
their body stops.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of fear
up to that point,

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:90%
and it's understandable why.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But the actual event itself is
painless and a bit of a blur.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you're lying
in a bed and you pass away,

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
then you kind of open your eyes
and look around and get out

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
of bed, and move around
and notice that you're

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:90%
no longer in your body.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:90%
But you look the same.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.130 align:middle line:84%
You just-- you're even
wearing the same thing.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So your consciousness is
creating you in the only form

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:90%
that you recognize yourself.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.907 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it seems to
be with all of these people

00:20:34.907 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever dealt with.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.560 align:middle line:84%
They continue to
reorganize themselves

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:84%
so they appear the
same as what you had

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.250 align:middle line:90%
seen for the first little bit.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:84%
What typically happens
is after a person makes

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:55.040 align:middle line:84%
that jump to this other
realm, after they pass away,

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.990 align:middle line:84%
there are people on the other
side who are waiting for them.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:90%
You never die alone.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Even though we can't see
them, the person who just

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:90%
passed away, they're there.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:90%
You never die alone.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And these folks
are there to help

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
you to get over
that initial shock

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and to become a bit
more reoriented.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
At that point then,
you usually are

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:84%
guided on a direction
of what you want to do.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And what you want to do is
the figurative part here,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people think
that when you pass away,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.929 align:middle line:84%
that you're sort of
sucked into the light,

00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:90%
and that's the end of it.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
you're enlightened.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: And you're enlightened.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not true.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.405 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: You're not
enlightened when you pass away.

00:21:42.405 --> 00:21:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: What happened
with this one fellow,

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty much the same
as it is with most everyone,

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is that you're
there, and then you

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.020 align:middle line:84%
go to the next
level of all of this

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
where you're surrounded by
your loved ones or someone,

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.595 align:middle line:90%
and you're taken into the light.

00:22:06.595 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Before you go into
the light, you

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:90%
might not be ready for that.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And you go into this
particular stage of existence

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:23.710 align:middle line:84%
where you're surrounded by
them in a familiar environment.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:90%
You might be on a picnic.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.950 align:middle line:90%
You might be in a home.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is you need in order
to feel comfortable and secure.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Will be created
for you or by you.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.018 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And if
these people who've

00:22:34.018 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:84%
come there to be
with you are, like,

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:42.640 align:middle line:84%
your great grandfather,
older people,

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:84%
you need to be able
to recognize them.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.029 align:middle line:84%
This one fellow
went to the point

00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:50.195 align:middle line:90%
to where he was on a picnic.

00:22:50.195 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:90%
He was a child again.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I found
him is because he was

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:90%
my ex-father-in-law.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Magnificent fellow.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to go and
make sure he was fine.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So I followed him to this
place, and here he is,

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:90%
running around like a kid.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking for him
and calling out his name,

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and he comes up and
he says, that's me.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.802 align:middle line:84%
And he says-- in just not
even in a blink of an eye,

00:23:26.802 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:84%
he's just standing there
like I remembered him.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
He says, what are
you doing here?

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I just came to
see that you are all right.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.180 align:middle line:90%
And he laughed.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.330 align:middle line:84%
He says, I haven't
felt this good--

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.806 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when
I've felt this good.

00:23:40.806 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:90%
And I said, all right.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:90%
That's good enough for me.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And I left.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
What happened past
that, I don't know.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen others who
did go from the surrounded

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:84%
by friends, loved ones, and
there's like this light,

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:90%
and it's just--

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
you know when you look
at a really bright light,

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:00.850 align:middle line:90%
it hurts your eyes.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
this, it just feels good.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they go--

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:09.790 align:middle line:84%
the ones who are ready go into
this light or with this light.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And one would
assume, those are not

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are hanging
out at the asylum.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they've moved on.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:84%
The soul is now
progressing into something

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.990 align:middle line:84%
else entirely and
maybe resting and maybe

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:84%
prepping for another
life down the road.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah,
and I don't know--

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whatever
souls do at that point.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.501 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the ones
left behind that are using

00:24:26.501 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:84%
electrical sources to
go boo and all that,

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:90%
those are the guys that maybe--

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:84%
are there certain features
of their personalities

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:84%
or such that are common
that they don't move on?

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Hmm, there is
one ghost that I know

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:90%
that was unfulfilled in a life.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And he stayed behind because
he wanted this in life,

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.125 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't want to
go and leave this--

00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until
he could feel it.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: --until he could at
least feel it and experience it

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.760 align:middle line:90%
somehow.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And with a little
bit of help, he did.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: There's another that--

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.720 align:middle line:90%


00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:90%
well, he just wanted to explore.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he
still does to this day.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:26.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're
compelled to do anything.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Instead, your free will
becomes even more important

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.860 align:middle line:90%
in that particular point.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing
something that's

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.060 align:middle line:84%
just really naughty,
evil, disturbing--

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.529 align:middle line:90%
and then happens as well.

00:25:41.529 --> 00:25:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, there
are a lot of crazy people

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:90%
who pass away.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.241 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:25:45.241 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: A lot of really
mean people that pass away.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And they maintain
their personalities.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And if they're, like,
crazy, what have you got?

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:90%
You've got crazy ghosts.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:58.580 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
people get their jollies

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:90%
from rushing up and--

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Disturbing you.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.715 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yes.

00:26:07.715 --> 00:26:08.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:08.515 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I find
that period of time right

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:15.750 align:middle line:10%
after a person's died, the
first few days in particular

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:10%
where they don't
tend to rush off

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:10%
into the light that
quickly, is really

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.670 align:middle line:10%
a very sacred,
wonderful period of time

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:10%
for information that maybe
hasn't been shared, or for--

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:10%
I've literally-- I remember
one friend's husband died,

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:10%
and I knew he'd
been hiding money.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.470 align:middle line:90%
And so I said--

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:84%
--instead of, oh, I'm sorry
for you're passing, I said,

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:90%
where'd you put the money?

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And he told me where
he put the money.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.573 align:middle line:90%
He was very clever at hiding it.

00:26:45.573 --> 00:26:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And so her sons got up there
behind all the insulation

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in the attic, and started
finding this money he'd

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:90%
been-- it was really crazy.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Squirreling away,
hiding from everyone.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But he cooperated at
that time, because there

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
was no good trying to squirrel
the money way any longer.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't there to inherit
his own loot or booty, right?

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:09.500 align:middle line:84%
But also more, you know,
I think spiritually,

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.140 align:middle line:84%
healing kind of messages that
can come through at that time.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
talk about that too.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, yes.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.830 align:middle line:10%
There's this one
fellow who was--

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.750 align:middle line:10%
I guess I really
shouldn't name names,

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:25.130 align:middle line:10%
but it had to do with
some very prominent people

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:10%
in our culture.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Important presidential
kind of people.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Did I say too much?

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:90%


00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:90%
He had had a stroke.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.390 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't talk.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:45.560 align:middle line:84%
He was a photographer, and
quite a well-known character

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:50.030 align:middle line:84%
during his time, as being
a world-class photographer

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:90%
of these very important people.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, his work kept
him away from home,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:90%
away from his family.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
He was always on the
go, always required

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:90%
to be there doing these things.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It was how he made his living,
and it was his profession.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:08.690 align:middle line:90%
He had a stroke.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.130 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't talk.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I was called in to
try and help him

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:84%
with his issues of not
being able to talk.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:90%
That's how I met him.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:90%
I took a look.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do anything,
because it was a stroke.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And when that part of the
brain's dead, it's just dead.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:90%
So he and I became friends.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:84%
He could sort of
point his finger

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and start spelling
out words, and that's

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:90%
how we had a conversation.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But as time went
on, his condition

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.180 align:middle line:90%
became worse and worse.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And the last few visits I had
with him, I would show up,

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and I was always called
there by his family.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:84%
By his mother in particular,
because he always

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.040 align:middle line:84%
seemed to do so much better
after I'd been there.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.107 align:middle line:84%
This one time I showed
up, he's out of his body.

00:28:58.107 --> 00:28:59.690 align:middle line:84%
He's standing beside
his bed, and he's

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.310 align:middle line:90%
like, I'm glad you're here.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm dying.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And he points to
the back of the bed,

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and he tells me that his tube--
he had this breathing tube

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:90%
thing--

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.865 align:middle line:90%
that it was stuck in his throat.

00:29:10.865 --> 00:29:13.357 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.357 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I can't breathe,
because of this tube.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I immediately called
the nurse, and I said,

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:90%
he can't breathe.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.990 align:middle line:90%
Something about this tube.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.640 align:middle line:84%
She pulled the bed
away from the wall

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and looked, because it
was draped out and behind

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.370 align:middle line:90%
where we couldn't see it.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:90%
It was full of phlegm.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, oh, yeah.

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And so she's like,
that should have never happened.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:90%
So she cleans it out.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:90%
He's happy.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.520 align:middle line:90%
He can breathe now.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.219 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're really
having conversations.

00:29:38.219 --> 00:29:39.760 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, if
I get through this,

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to teach you how
to be a great photographer.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why are you--

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, you're not
going to get through this.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't get any better.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.100 align:middle line:90%
It gets worse.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I have to
stay alive because my son,

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:90%
he's mad at me.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:90%
And I have to--

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.620 align:middle line:90%
I have to make up with him.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.365 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell him I'm sorry.

00:30:06.365 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:90%
And I know he's going to come.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.040 align:middle line:90%
I know he is.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So I had the conversation
with his mother,

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.290 align:middle line:84%
who knew that I was having these
kind of conversations with him.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And she says, his son
isn't going to come.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, this went on for
another couple of weeks.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And at the point where I
was there and he's like,

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.830 align:middle line:90%
he's not going to come.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.180 align:middle line:90%
I said, I know.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.860 align:middle line:90%
He's not coming.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.980 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, then I have
no reason to stay here.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:90%
It's time for me to go.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And he thanked me,
and he was happy.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.780 align:middle line:90%
He was kind of laughing.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And all the time, he's
standing outside his body

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:47.290 align:middle line:90%
beside the bed.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just talking in
real whispered tones.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't want anyone to hear me.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.725 align:middle line:84%
And he says, it's
time for me to go.

00:30:56.725 --> 00:30:57.750 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, listen.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:90%
Don't go just yet.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.410 align:middle line:84%
How about if you go in
about three or four hours?

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Let me get home and, you know--

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I said, just don't go
with me standing here.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: And he laughed.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.150 align:middle line:84%
He thought that
was really funny.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:90%
I'll wait till 5:00.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.790 align:middle line:90%
It was 1:00 in the afternoon.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:90%
So I left.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:30.070 align:middle line:84%
A little after 5:00, I got
a phone call from his mom,

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and she said that
he had passed away.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream later about him,
which was one of these visit

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:38.660 align:middle line:90%
things that I've done.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.150 align:middle line:90%
And he was happy.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:43.780 align:middle line:84%
He understood it all, and he
wasn't sticking around here.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.960 align:middle line:84%
He was going to
go into the light.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.496 align:middle line:84%
And that's the last
time I ever saw him.

00:31:49.496 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
in the light.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I've never-- I've tried
to go there, but--

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.791 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I think
because most people

00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:56.680 align:middle line:90%
that go that far, they're gone.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's a more
infinite aspect of self.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.325 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But I think I should be
able to go there and come back.

00:32:02.325 --> 00:32:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That would be nice.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:04.665 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, I'm curious.

00:32:04.665 --> 00:32:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I don't want to have
to not be able to come back

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:90%
in order to know what's there.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The
curious part of me--

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand that.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So now if we go
back to-- so that's

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.980 align:middle line:84%
an area in which you can
communicate and help someone

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.920 align:middle line:90%
through the process.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.795 align:middle line:84%
And afterward, you can
still speak with them.

00:32:21.795 --> 00:32:24.860 align:middle line:84%
You can deliver messages,
just like your Aunt

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Betty did with you.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
now about the ones

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:84%
who are more
disturbing of people,

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and how we can start
working with them

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and helping them
out of our space.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really important
for everyone to understand,

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:84%
once a person dies
or leaves their body,

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:84%
makes that transition,
they're still around.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it's still a good
time to communicate and share

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:84%
your sentiments
and clear things.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And just understand, even
if you can't hear them,

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:84%
they can hear you
perfectly well.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:57.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a good time.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Just because someone has
left their body doesn't

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.169 align:middle line:90%
mean the relationship is over.

00:33:01.169 --> 00:33:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No, that's true.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But now we're talking about
entities who are bugging us,

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Getting into the
ghostbusting part.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yes.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You did a
ghostbusting not long ago

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.150 align:middle line:90%
with a woman in California.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.608 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that, and then I'd

00:33:12.608 --> 00:33:15.590 align:middle line:84%
like you to give us some kind of
practical understanding of how

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:84%
we know when we're
seriously being messed with,

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and when we actually do
something about it versus just

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.350 align:middle line:90%
whatever, leave it alone.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, the incident
in California,

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't really advertise
that I do this.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Of course, at this point,
folks are going to find out,

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:90%
I suppose.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Ghosts and the whole range
of this paranormal subject,

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.820 align:middle line:84%
there isn't anything here
that really frightens

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.420 align:middle line:90%
me or intimidates me.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.220 align:middle line:84%
It probably might sound
pretentious to some.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.020 align:middle line:84%
But you know, there
are people who

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.450 align:middle line:84%
say they can see
them quite clearly.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of those people.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So when I can see them,
what's there to be afraid of?

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm used to seeing
them transparent

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.490 align:middle line:84%
or just appear as
part of a body,

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:04.490 align:middle line:84%
head and shoulders, or stuff
that would be creepy to most.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.100 align:middle line:90%


00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.120 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't bother me.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.489 align:middle line:84%
And this gal in California,
through another person,

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:17.480 align:middle line:84%
said that she needed
some help because there

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.600 align:middle line:90%
was an entity in her house.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.520 align:middle line:90%
This is an older gal.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Entity in her house that
was pushing her down,

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.820 align:middle line:84%
scratching her,
wouldn't let her sleep,

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.870 align:middle line:84%
doing all kinds of things
to just really bother her.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And there were other
entities in the house

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.050 align:middle line:84%
too, and that she
could get no peace,

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.409 align:middle line:90%
and just didn't know what to do.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:84%
She was just at her wits
end with all of this.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:90%
So I'm asked, can you help?

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:84%
And as I tell people all
the time, I have no idea.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.350 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to
find out if I don't try?

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.520 align:middle line:90%
So Kathy and I went there.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Now Kathy is not a ghostbuster.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.548 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:35:02.548 --> 00:35:03.492 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.492 --> 00:35:05.989 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But she doesn't
take anything off of anybody.

00:35:05.989 --> 00:35:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No, that's true.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.905 align:middle line:84%
But if something just
appears in front of her,

00:35:09.905 --> 00:35:11.430 align:middle line:84%
her hair just
sticks straight out.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:15.390 align:middle line:84%
She's going to be like [??
Lucy. ?? ] So she's like,

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this ghost stuff.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:90%
The ghosts scare me.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.860 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing to be afraid of.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.190 align:middle line:84%
They're just energy
forms and have no bodies.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So we get there, and the gal
welcomes me into her home.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.466 align:middle line:84%
And she probably goes out back
and stays in the backyard.

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:39.300 align:middle line:84%
She says, I can't
be in the house.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.410 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So Kathy-- we all go
back in the backyard

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.560 align:middle line:90%
and talk for a few minutes.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going in, and I
said, all right, come on, Kath.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:51.969 align:middle line:84%
Let's go find out
what's happening.

00:35:51.969 --> 00:35:53.385 align:middle line:84%
She said, you
really need my help?

00:35:53.385 --> 00:35:55.560 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.560 align:middle line:90%
You need to see this.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.050 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the first--

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:01.080 align:middle line:84%
well, not the first
time, but another

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.710 align:middle line:84%
of those times where I've
wanted to show her something.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:09.755 align:middle line:84%
So we go in the house and go
walking through this place.

00:36:09.755 --> 00:36:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I should say at this point,
when we got in the house--

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.270 align:middle line:90%
I left this part out.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.960 align:middle line:84%
When we got in the house,
there was this man there

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:90%
who was just really rude.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.990 align:middle line:90%
And just--

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A physical
man or any ghost man?

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: A ghost man.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But to me, he was
about as physical as they get,

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.590 align:middle line:90%
except I knew he wasn't real.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And he tries to poke
me in my right eye.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:90%
He's, like, taking swipes at me.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.400 align:middle line:90%
"You're in my house.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.200 align:middle line:90%
Out of here!"

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.112 align:middle line:90%
You know, boom, boom.

00:36:40.112 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm just annoyed by this.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Get away from me.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.024 align:middle line:84%
He's, like, grumbling,
and he goes away.

00:36:49.024 --> 00:36:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So now Kathy and I
are going in, and she

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:54.860 align:middle line:84%
knows this has happened because
she saw me flinch and go,

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:59.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, what is wrong
with you to nobody.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:90%
We go through the house.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.840 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, she's
sleeping in a room

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.330 align:middle line:90%
that was their bedroom.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:84%
His bed is here, and
her bed is there,

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:12.890 align:middle line:90%
and that's where she's sleeping.

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, he passed away,
I don't know when.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:84%
He was apparently
not very nice to her

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:26.090 align:middle line:84%
in some capacity, and
a domineering force.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And he was making sure that
he was maintaining his house.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm
in charge here.

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I found
out where he was--

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.711 align:middle line:84%
because when I
went in his room, I

00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:90%
had to walk right through him.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.970 align:middle line:84%
He didn't like me
going into that room.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So I told him he's
going to have to leave.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm
not going anywhere,

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:90%
and you can't make me.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.375 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'll take it
up with you later,

00:37:53.375 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:84%
because I'm picking
up something else.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I went out of
there, went around.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.356 align:middle line:84%
There was this one
particular room

00:37:58.356 --> 00:38:00.890 align:middle line:90%
she could not go into at all.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It was just creeping her out.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Things would happen, things
would move, all that.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So I went in there with
Kathy, and it's a dark room.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And I go to the closet,
open the closet up.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just full of
some boxes and stuff.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But there are beings
in the closet.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.900 align:middle line:90%
And Kathy's waiting over here.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, come her
a second, Kathy.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.390 align:middle line:90%
I want to show you this.

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I want to see if
you can see this.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And she says, it's
a closet with boxes.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.550 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Watch what happens when
I throw energy at it.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So I lit it up, and these
luminous spheres of light,

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:84%
which were the entities, started
floating around the room.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.190 align:middle line:90%
And she's just marveling.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.990 align:middle line:90%
She could see it.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.400 align:middle line:90%
I said, don't be afraid.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.280 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
here to hurt you.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So I got rid of those
guys and found out

00:38:54.430 --> 00:39:01.240 align:middle line:84%
that the old man was pulling
energy from this woman,

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and these entities were
pulling energy from him.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So it was a symbiotic
relationship going in a circle.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.990 align:middle line:84%
He'd do something to hurt
her, get her all emotional.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.170 align:middle line:84%
He'd get a charge out of it,
and these things parasitically

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:15.970 align:middle line:90%
take it from him.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I got rid of that and
then the man, got rid of him.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.270 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to go.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
you get him to leave?

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.047 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I just sucked all
the energy away from him.

00:39:30.047 --> 00:39:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you
told me this before,

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.713 align:middle line:84%
that you just sucked the
energy out of these guys.

00:39:33.713 --> 00:39:35.725 align:middle line:84%
Now most people are
thinking, that's dangerous.

00:39:35.725 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to suck
that kind of energy in.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:90%
But what's the truth of it?

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.446 align:middle line:90%
What's the experience of it?

00:39:40.446 --> 00:39:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: You know,
everything is energy.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.700 align:middle line:84%
When I'm working on someone
who has something definitely

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:47.500 align:middle line:90%
wrong with them--

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're doing
your healing work, right?

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.928 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: --when I pull
that energy into myself,

00:39:50.928 --> 00:39:56.320 align:middle line:84%
energy does not have
a consciousness.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.545 align:middle line:84%
The soul gives a consciousness
in relationship to the ghosts.

00:39:59.545 --> 00:40:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.371 align:middle line:84%
Our attention towards
the energy polarizes

00:40:05.371 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:90%
it one way or the other.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Our judgment causes
energy to be good or bad.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.890 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, energy's
not good or bad.

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:15.230 align:middle line:90%
It's just energy.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So when you draw energy
away like this guy

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:84%
was pulling energy from
her, and it was feeding him.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So I just started pulling
energy off of him.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Just absorbing it off.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.350 align:middle line:90%
He says, you can't hurt me.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:30.350 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, watch.

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Watch.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.420 align:middle line:90%
[SUCKING]

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I just drew
the energy off of him.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.890 align:middle line:90%
That energy comes through me.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:38.800 align:middle line:84%
There is always a
trinity involved.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what God is.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I haven't got a clue.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I think God's on the other side
where that bright light's at.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.760 align:middle line:84%
But whatever God is, there's
like this arrangement

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.030 align:middle line:90%
that I think that we can have.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And it works
something like this.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.470 align:middle line:90%
You bring the energy from here.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:59.200 align:middle line:84%
In the case of this
ghost, bring it into you.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.000 align:middle line:90%
You just--

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.800 align:middle line:90%
[INHALE]

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.800 align:middle line:90%
--absorb it in.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you send
it back to God.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.130 align:middle line:90%
It never was yours.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.390 align:middle line:90%
It'll never be yours.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:13.450 align:middle line:84%
It always belongs to
the creative essence,

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:15.010 align:middle line:90%
whatever God is.

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Whether I'm working
on a person who's ill

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.780 align:middle line:84%
or doing this thing
with the ghosts.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you are dealing with
this sort of circumstance,

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.290 align:middle line:84%
you see, energy's going
to become whatever you--

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Assign to it.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you assign to it.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
thinking, oh, I've got

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:40.960 align:middle line:84%
to protect myself,
ooh, spooky stuff,

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:45.910 align:middle line:84%
that energy came from
God originally, and is

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:48.590 align:middle line:90%
going to go back to God.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:53.000 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
protect yourself from?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.295 align:middle line:90%
It's God energy.

00:41:55.295 --> 00:41:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And who are you to protect
yourself from God energy?

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.910 align:middle line:84%
The thing that really
messes with people

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.930 align:middle line:90%
is that they are afraid.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:06.680 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can
do this sort of thing

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.684 align:middle line:90%
is if you have confidence.

00:42:08.684 --> 00:42:10.100 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
any confidence--

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.891 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't be
sucking their energy in.

00:42:11.891 --> 00:42:13.479 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:13.479 --> 00:42:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: You know, it's kind
of like eating a bad taco.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.480 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.600 align:middle line:90%
So you suck the energy in.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.910 align:middle line:84%
What's he-- is he struggling
to keep his identity somehow?

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:23.865 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, he is.

00:42:23.865 --> 00:42:24.690 align:middle line:90%
He's yelling at me.

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Stop that!

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:26.450 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that!

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I said, I am doing that.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.930 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't go, so now
you're going to have to.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Because there comes a point
where their energy becomes

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.280 align:middle line:90%
so weak, they can't stay here.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, that's
when they go and they're

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:42.095 align:middle line:90%
sucked into the light.

00:42:42.095 --> 00:42:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And then that's done.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So by the end of this, her
house was quieted down?

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, yeah.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:49.346 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
reflections did

00:42:49.346 --> 00:42:50.660 align:middle line:90%
you get from her after that?

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.820 align:middle line:90%
All's well?

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, she
had other issues,

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.486 align:middle line:90%
because there was water--

00:42:55.486 --> 00:42:57.050 align:middle line:90%
this was in California--

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:58.697 align:middle line:84%
and there was water
that was somehow

00:42:58.697 --> 00:42:59.780 align:middle line:90%
channeled under her house.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.005 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:01.005 --> 00:43:02.629 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I've
run into this before,

00:43:02.629 --> 00:43:05.060 align:middle line:84%
where running water
under a person's house

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.480 align:middle line:84%
provides so much Earth
energy that these things can

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.910 align:middle line:90%
connect to it and use it.

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So in order to get rid of the
potential for this to happen,

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:19.136 align:middle line:84%
then I had to focus on
that aquifer and move it.

00:43:19.136 --> 00:43:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
I'm sure there are

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:22.630 align:middle line:84%
going to be folks that
think that's just nuts.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:23.990 align:middle line:90%
But you can ask her.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:25.270 align:middle line:90%
She can tell you.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.020 align:middle line:90%
I've done it a couple of times.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.020 align:middle line:90%
The Earth usually cooperates.

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And it just moved it out
from under her house.

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.017 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
then all was quiet?

00:43:34.017 --> 00:43:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I guess so.

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And I want to bring
up something that's--

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:41.900 align:middle line:84%
it's not a ghost story,
it's an entity story--

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.510 align:middle line:84%
because it brings another
point of view into it.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.852 align:middle line:84%
And that is on my
35th birthday, I

00:43:46.852 --> 00:43:48.560 align:middle line:84%
was going to go out
that night on a date,

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and so I decided to lie
down and take a little nap.

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Except as I was, I
was feeling something,

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.700 align:middle line:90%
you know, massaging my hand.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not-- those entities
don't bother me, right?

00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.959 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK, whatever.

00:43:59.959 --> 00:44:01.250 align:middle line:90%
They're just massaging my hand.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.900 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.200 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do anything.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm just noticing it.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.021 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the
sudden, I started

00:44:07.021 --> 00:44:09.980 align:middle line:84%
noticing, like, the electricity
draining down my arm

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:90%
and down my body.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, I'm noticing
all the energies draining out

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.950 align:middle line:90%
through my leg and my foot.

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it was on both
sides when it got to my legs,

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:21.890 align:middle line:90%
draining away.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:23.590 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, what the heck?

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And I still wasn't
thinking much of it.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to
stand up, I fell down,

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.080 align:middle line:90%
because my legs weren't working.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.120 align:middle line:90%
My muscles had even gone weak.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:35.750 align:middle line:84%
All the energy was drained out,
and I felt like a limp rag.

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, I don't
know what that was about.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.160 align:middle line:84%
But got myself together
and went out that night.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But I was talking to the beings
later about it, and they said,

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.300 align:middle line:90%
you didn't ask them to stop.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:90%
You gave permission.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.730 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do anything.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
notion of when we're freely

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.090 align:middle line:84%
giving energy to beings on
the other side, which is also

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:58.790 align:middle line:84%
happening all the
time subconsciously,

00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and in dream time, and when
we're being taken advantage of,

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and to learn how we
make that demarcation.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I could've said, hey, knock
it off and stopped it.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:10.552 align:middle line:84%
But I was just curious
to see what would happen.

00:45:10.552 --> 00:45:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I would
do the same thing.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.301 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:45:13.301 --> 00:45:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
from a practical level,

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:18.930 align:middle line:84%
our normal interface with
beings on the other side that's

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:19.730 align:middle line:90%
typical.

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.145 align:middle line:84%
We all have entities around
us all the time, right?

00:45:22.145 --> 00:45:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, that's true.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:24.728 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that,

00:45:24.728 --> 00:45:27.420 align:middle line:84%
the phenomena that we have
visitors that like us or are

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.220 align:middle line:90%
traveling with us.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they find us interesting.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And we may freely give
them energy, we may not.

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, and I think that
when you go into this arena

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:42.720 align:middle line:84%
where you might want to
freely give them energy,

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.850 align:middle line:90%
there are two choices.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:48.290 align:middle line:84%
One is to give them
your energy or to allow

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:51.230 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the cosmos
to move through you.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good distinction.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: You know, and let's
just call it, you know,

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.640 align:middle line:84%
the energy from God,
the flow from God

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.780 align:middle line:84%
or creator, whatever
you imagine God being.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:06.410 align:middle line:84%
If you let it come from
you, then how much energy

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:08.860 align:middle line:84%
do you have that you can part
with and still be all right?

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.494 align:middle line:84%
Mine wasn't-- yeah, I
didn't manage it well.

00:46:11.494 --> 00:46:13.368 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: No, you might
have been very strong,

00:46:13.368 --> 00:46:14.340 align:middle line:90%
but once it was taken--

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.423 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not once they
take all your electricity.

00:46:16.423 --> 00:46:17.522 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:17.522 --> 00:46:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But if
you let it-- that's

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:25.079 align:middle line:84%
what I do when I'm working
with my clients who are sick.

00:46:25.079 --> 00:46:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the
thing a lot of healers

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:29.630 align:middle line:84%
make a mistake in doing when
they're working with folks.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.159 align:middle line:90%
You don't use your own energy.

00:46:31.159 --> 00:46:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bring it through.

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: You bring up through.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.130 align:middle line:90%
You just breathe.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Breathe it in and share,
breathe it in and share.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.511 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But you have to
have a mental construct,

00:46:40.511 --> 00:46:42.500 align:middle line:84%
because energy doesn't
know what to do.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have to direct it?

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, we have
to know what you want.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Not what you need.

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:49.840 align:middle line:90%
The key here is what you want.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And I want this, and
I see it in my mind.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.630 align:middle line:90%
and so it occurs that way.

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And it always seems to
work quite well for me.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've taught
other people, and it

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:84%
works quite well for
them as a result.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.115 align:middle line:90%
So those are your two choices.

00:47:05.115 --> 00:47:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
makes total sense.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:06.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Of course.

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you're dealing with
something that's malevolent,

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.230 align:middle line:84%
you can give it any name
you want to give it.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:24.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, evil, demonic,
precocious, whatever.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:26.060 align:middle line:84%
In case folks are
wondering, yeah, I

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:27.817 align:middle line:90%
do think there are demons.

00:47:27.817 --> 00:47:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt about
that whatsoever.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're all realms
living together here.

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that some
of these people who

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:41.570 align:middle line:84%
are pretty insane who cross over
and don't know they're dead,

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:44.142 align:middle line:84%
they just suddenly
have their freedom.

00:47:44.142 --> 00:47:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the reason they
were insane is because they

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:47.820 align:middle line:90%
were attached by demons.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So you know, you've got
a whole range of spooky things.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So what do you do
if there's a demon?

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.872 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:47:55.872 --> 00:47:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is noticing that
things are amiss in their house.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're pushing
things over at night.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.690 align:middle line:90%
You know, it doesn't matter.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're bugging them
or running their fingers

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:07.020 align:middle line:90%
through their hair and all that.

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But you're being bothered
by unseen entities.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can't see
them like you do.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.920 align:middle line:90%
You just know they're there.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.680 align:middle line:84%
How would you start
recommending people protect

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:90%
themselves or their homes?

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And you said earlier,
if you're afraid,

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.560 align:middle line:84%
don't go into a fearful
protective mode.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.564 align:middle line:84%
But how would you take care
of this as an average person?

00:48:27.564 --> 00:48:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, take a look
at how people classically

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.940 align:middle line:90%
are doing this.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a good study,
because this'll tell you

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.700 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more about
how there are mistakes made

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and how there are
solutions found.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:46.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, you have the priest
comes in and does an exorcism

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and does the prayers in
the house and all this.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And it gets quiet for
a week or a month,

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and then it starts
coming back again.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:00.330 align:middle line:84%
The thing that I find
works really well

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:05.130 align:middle line:84%
if this is happening--
number one, even sitting here

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:07.660 align:middle line:84%
now, talking with you, if
something just sort of popped

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.120 align:middle line:84%
up in front of me,
I would be startled,

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.670 align:middle line:90%
because who wouldn't be?

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:15.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like popping a balloon
when you're least expecting it.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But you can't be
so put out by this

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to be
just totally unraveled.

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Now sure, we've all
seen "The Exorcist."

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.190 align:middle line:84%
If we haven't, we should,
because it's a good scare.

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:31.309 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: We've all seen--

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:33.559 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or "The Conjuring."

00:49:33.559 --> 00:49:34.725 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Or "The Conjuring."

00:49:34.725 --> 00:49:36.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, all
these scary movies.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.891 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's all
these things out there.

00:49:37.891 --> 00:49:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what our
mental construct is where

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:42.170 align:middle line:90%
these things are involved.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have a
predetermined response

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.480 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to spooky stuff.

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the right way to act is to
be really afraid and scream.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But that means you're
sending this energy out

00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:58.580 align:middle line:90%
to whatever it is--

00:49:58.580 --> 00:49:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To strengthen it.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: --and
strengthen it, and it's

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.960 align:middle line:90%
getting its feedback loop.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do
not start emoting.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I mean, it's
OK to start that way,

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:08.410 align:middle line:90%
because you're going to.

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:09.295 align:middle line:90%
It's only human nature.

00:50:09.295 --> 00:50:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
going to be startled,

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.770 align:middle line:84%
but don't keep putting out
the fear wattage, right?

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Instead what you
would do is say,

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:19.177 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's going on
here, but I don't like it.

00:50:19.177 --> 00:50:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And no, I'm not going
to get upset about it.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:24.715 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get all spooked
out and act like, you know,

00:50:24.715 --> 00:50:26.570 align:middle line:90%
a scared baby.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:28.870 align:middle line:90%
But this is my home.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:31.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't like this.

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:33.130 align:middle line:84%
There's just a little
move the person

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:36.350 align:middle line:84%
can make that'll make
all the difference.

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And it'd be interesting
if some of your viewers

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.400 align:middle line:84%
were to try this if
they're encountering

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.570 align:middle line:90%
this sort of thing.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Tell me if I'm right or wrong.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.750 align:middle line:90%
So leave it open.

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:49.810 align:middle line:84%
If you just stop
and get centered

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and you get a little bit of
confidence within yourself--

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.920 align:middle line:84%
not angry, not anxious,
and not apprehensive,

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.860 align:middle line:84%
but just like a state
of being that's like,

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm in control here.

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:04.470 align:middle line:90%
So I want you gone.

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:07.840 align:middle line:84%
You take a deep breath, and
you just hold it for a moment,

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and then let it out nice and
slowly, with the idea being,

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:13.510 align:middle line:90%
you're not welcome here.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Go away.

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:18.040 align:middle line:90%
See if that does anything.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:22.810 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't, then you
might not be doing it right,

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:26.680 align:middle line:84%
or they might be so strong
that you need something else.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what's step two?

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:31.947 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Step two-- um,
that's a good question.

00:51:31.947 --> 00:51:32.747 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:32.747 --> 00:51:34.205 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
a little technique

00:51:34.205 --> 00:51:35.590 align:middle line:90%
I use for entities sometimes.

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:37.252 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I had a
feeling you did.

00:51:37.252 --> 00:51:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It's why I wanted
you to take this.

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So-- and I was
taught this years ago

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:45.640 align:middle line:84%
when I was in a
certification class

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.599 align:middle line:84%
for hypnotherapy that
takes place over months,

00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:49.390 align:middle line:84%
you know, a few nights
a week and all that,

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:50.770 align:middle line:90%
and you encounter things.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And this instructor
said, oftentimes

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:55.600 align:middle line:84%
when you're dealing
with addictions,

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.160 align:middle line:84%
it's because that person
has someone surfing off

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.710 align:middle line:84%
of that addiction
on the other side,

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:01.720 align:middle line:90%
which I thought was interesting.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Like alcohol, they're
going to surf and impress

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:07.490 align:middle line:84%
upon that person
a greater desire.

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Absolutely.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're
using people.

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:12.580 align:middle line:90%
So this was what they told us.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And to be loving and
discerning and firm about it,

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.130 align:middle line:84%
address the entity and
say, you're not welcome,

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.130 align:middle line:90%
just like you said.

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:22.967 align:middle line:84%
And then without going
into what you do,

00:52:22.967 --> 00:52:24.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, sucking the
energy and everything,

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.310 align:middle line:84%
this is a different
technique, but it does work.

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.800 align:middle line:90%
And then simply say, look.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.060 align:middle line:90%
You're misplaced where you are.

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.740 align:middle line:84%
There are those
who will help you.

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:33.940 align:middle line:90%
Go where you need to go.

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:35.820 align:middle line:84%
This isn't where you
need to be any longer,

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.090 align:middle line:90%
and you're not welcome.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.155 align:middle line:84%
And say, and I'm
going to count to 10.

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And in the count
of 10, you're going

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.820 align:middle line:84%
to be made to be very
uncomfortable if you haven't

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.920 align:middle line:84%
left this place, so
take advantage of those

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.140 align:middle line:90%
who wish to help you over.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And then on the count
of 10, essentially--

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:50.459 align:middle line:90%
and I do it with--

00:52:50.459 --> 00:52:51.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm serious when I do it.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:52.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.130 align:middle line:90%
--basically, boom!

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's like in the
mind, a white explosion,

00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:02.070 align:middle line:84%
almost like an atomic blast of
white light in the whole place,

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:04.140 align:middle line:90%
as far out as you need it to be.

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Phew!

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how it clears
things out if they haven't--

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: And that

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --already
chosen to leave.

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: --brings
me to the point,

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:17.800 align:middle line:84%
that when you see these
folks who are doing,

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.810 align:middle line:84%
whatever ghostbusting
they're doing, getting

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:23.650 align:middle line:84%
rid of the dark entities,
the ghosts, demons,

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:28.750 align:middle line:84%
whatever, it isn't
the right and ritual

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.030 align:middle line:90%
of any religious practice.

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:33.070 align:middle line:84%
It isn't the sage
and the feathers.

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Nothing fancy.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It is, pure and simple,
you finally get to a point

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:40.990 align:middle line:84%
to where you have
some confidence,

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and you release your energy, and
you do it in a commanding way.

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Your intention is what
sets the tone and the path

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:54.640 align:middle line:90%
for the energy to be released.

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.020 align:middle line:90%
It's the intention every time.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:57.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm adamant when I do it.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:53:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It's, your gone.

00:53:58.810 --> 00:53:59.890 align:middle line:90%
You have a choice.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:01.931 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And this is a
good practice for everyone

00:54:01.931 --> 00:54:03.760 align:middle line:90%
to use, what you just said.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.127 align:middle line:90%
Mine's OK too.

00:54:05.127 --> 00:54:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:07.240 align:middle line:90%
They're one in the same.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Just in a different--

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Different way.

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:11.131 align:middle line:84%
It's like vanilla
and French vanilla.

00:54:11.131 --> 00:54:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But what
you're doing is

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.260 align:middle line:84%
you're building
this within yourself

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:22.600 align:middle line:84%
to where it finally gets to
a point of explosiveness,

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.280 align:middle line:90%
and the energy goes out.

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the same with
what I'm doing too.

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.142 align:middle line:90%
When I--

00:54:29.142 --> 00:54:30.099 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:54:30.099 --> 00:54:32.390 align:middle line:84%
--I don't even know if we
have time to talk about this.

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have
about two minutes.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, then we won't go into
the extraordinarily haunted--

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us the
cliff notes on it.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It was
place down in Mexico.

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:44.560 align:middle line:90%
It was an old fortress.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in there was
murdered by the other side.

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Heads on pikes.

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:53.140 align:middle line:90%
And they were all stuck there.

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:57.415 align:middle line:84%
And I went into that at midnight
on the night of the anniversary

00:54:57.415 --> 00:54:58.570 align:middle line:90%
of when it happened.

00:54:58.570 --> 00:54:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, jeez.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:54:59.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:59.200 --> 00:54:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Hundreds
of years later.

00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Glutton, you are.

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:01.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, they
said they needed help.

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So I wanted to see
what was there, and I found it.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.170 align:middle line:90%
It's quite a story.

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is when
I finished, it was quiet.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But it required a lot
more than just me doing

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.660 align:middle line:90%
what I've been talking about.

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
another level of this

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:27.230 align:middle line:84%
when you run into issues, and
this time, it involved angels.

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And I guess we can
save that for another time.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You called on your
better angels to help out.

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, Jerry.

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take a
few more minutes.

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Finish the story about bringing
the angels into the equation.

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: All right.

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:49.820 align:middle line:84%
When I walked in there,
it was pitch black.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And of course, like I told
you, I can see these things.

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:54.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
I see all the time.

00:55:54.950 --> 00:56:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just something that I see
when I choose I want to see it.

00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:03.170 align:middle line:84%
It was really, really
spooky, because they

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:06.170 align:middle line:84%
turned this old fortress
into a bit of a museum,

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and the workers
were having trouble

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:12.770 align:middle line:84%
working there and making it such
and keeping up, because things

00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:14.060 align:middle line:90%
were going bad wrong.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:17.060 align:middle line:90%


00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:21.650 align:middle line:84%
They were seeing things,
hearing things from this battle.

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:23.750 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going through.

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:25.280 align:middle line:90%
And there are people hiding.

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Men, women, children, and
they were all massacred.

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.130 align:middle line:84%
There was no one left
alive in this place,

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.152 align:middle line:84%
and there was about 200,
250 people in this--

00:56:33.152 --> 00:56:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
lot of tortured souls.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yep.

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So I went through, and I
started communicating with them.

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And you know, on the other side,
there isn't a language barrier.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:46.952 align:middle line:84%
I found that to be
a fascinating thing,

00:56:46.952 --> 00:56:49.160 align:middle line:84%
because this is the first
time in another country I'd

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.600 align:middle line:90%
tried this.

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, I finally was
taken to the guy

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:57.200 align:middle line:84%
who was the main
commander of this play,

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.500 align:middle line:84%
of the army who
was inside there.

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:04.432 align:middle line:84%
And I told him about this, and
he was, like, really upset.

00:57:04.432 --> 00:57:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Didn't want to hear it.

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:07.100 align:middle line:90%
The battle is raging.

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:08.525 align:middle line:90%
And you know, he's--

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:09.784 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's trapped.

00:57:09.784 --> 00:57:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: They're all
worried and hiding,

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:13.158 align:middle line:84%
and soldiers are ready
to fight them when

00:57:13.158 --> 00:57:15.110 align:middle line:90%
they come through the wall.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I basically just told
God that I needed angels

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:24.280 align:middle line:84%
to help me, because they were
not going to listen to me.

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I told the commander, I
said, if I show you an angel,

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.270 align:middle line:90%
will you believe me?

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:32.610 align:middle line:90%
He says, no one can do that.

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
the white light.

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:41.930 align:middle line:84%
It opened and appeared, and
an angel stepped through.

00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And then another, and then
another, and then another.

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:49.580 align:middle line:84%
It was just the strangest
thing I had ever seen.

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to seeing
ghosts, but not angels.

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And they walked through
there, gathering these people.

00:57:56.510 --> 00:58:01.250 align:middle line:84%
The commander would not leave
until the last person had

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:03.930 align:middle line:84%
gone through, and then
he was able to leave.

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:06.920 align:middle line:90%
That's a beautiful story.

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: He asked me,
what about the people

00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that were buried over
in that cemetery?

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:13.980 align:middle line:90%
I said, what cemetery?

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.380 align:middle line:84%
He says, they
killed all of them,

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:17.088 align:middle line:84%
just put them in a
mass grave over there.

00:58:17.088 --> 00:58:21.080 align:middle line:90%


00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So I went up on
the highest wall,

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.305 align:middle line:90%
and he showed me before he left.

00:58:27.305 --> 00:58:29.950 align:middle line:90%


00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:32.030 align:middle line:84%
There were angels
all over the place.

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:35.010 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- well,
I already told you.

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:36.460 align:middle line:90%
It was crazy to see.

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.400 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, I don't know.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Angels went over there.

00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And here is another light
shimmering, another portal?

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:47.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.540 align:middle line:90%
It's just there.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:52.330 align:middle line:90%
And then it closes.

00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I think
they got all of them.

00:58:55.930 --> 00:59:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And he thanked me profusely, and
then he went with this angel,

00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.150 align:middle line:90%
walking into this--

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:09.010 align:middle line:84%
right off the edge of the
cliff, just hanging in the air.

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Just, poof.

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:10.050 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes--

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:10.850 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSH]

00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:11.650 align:middle line:90%


00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:16.090 align:middle line:90%
So it felt a lot different.

00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I went downstairs
and told the people,

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:24.150 align:middle line:84%
because this group of people
had brought me into this.

00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:28.110 align:middle line:84%
They were, like,
principles for this place.

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:31.825 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- the other
thing that-- after I

00:59:31.825 --> 00:59:33.200 align:middle line:84%
told him the whole
story, he said

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.783 align:middle line:84%
the other thing he
was concerned about

00:59:34.783 --> 00:59:36.190 align:middle line:90%
was that mass grave over there.

00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:40.650 align:middle line:90%
Said, the mass grave?

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:42.330 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah?

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there was
a mass grave over there.

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And she says, we just
found that last week.

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:52.890 align:middle line:90%
All these bodies.

00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:59.340 align:middle line:84%
50, 60 people, women and
children in a mass grave.

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And they just started
the excavation process.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So that kind
of validated to me that,

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.300 align:middle line:90%
you know--

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
help when it's needed.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you can't
handle it yourself,

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:13.740 align:middle line:90%
call on your better angels.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I've never
done it since, but--

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Still,
that's beautiful.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.534 align:middle line:84%
How could you have done
that one alone, right?

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I don't know
that I could have.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty creepy, and
they wouldn't listen to me.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no, no, no.

01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:27.360 align:middle line:90%
That is creepy.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I find that
a very uplifting story,

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:33.060 align:middle line:84%
a very beautiful story,
and an empowering one.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.940 align:middle line:10%
Because again, you might
have a little creepy

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.370 align:middle line:10%
stuff hanging around,
but the beautiful help

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:39.340 align:middle line:10%
is always there too.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:40.140 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLS: Sure.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:43.170 align:middle line:10%
I think the bottom line
is not to be afraid.

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:45.000 align:middle line:84%
It was real hard,
walking into that place

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.514 align:middle line:90%
in the dark with no flashlight.

01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's the
kind of stuff you do.

01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It is.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until next
time, more stories await.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's
always a pleasure.

01:00:57.490 --> 01:01:01.112 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Thank you so much
for inviting me back on.

01:01:01.112 --> 01:01:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, always a
pleasure to sit with Jerry.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't seen my
other interviews with him,

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:07.520 align:middle line:84%
you can find them all
in the Gaia archives,

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.280 align:middle line:84%
including the one telling
about his strange beginning

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.300 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.930 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
