>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of my
favorite guests, Vernon Mahabal,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.170 align:middle line:10%
is back with us to
expand the story of what

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:10%
we can learn from our hands.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:10%
In our last
conversation, which I

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.280 align:middle line:10%
suggest you might
enjoy watching,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.630 align:middle line:10%
Vernon talked about palm reading
at birth in the Eastern world

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:10%
to help guide the child's life.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to speak
of the soul's expression

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:90%
in the palm of our hands.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Vern.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:90%
So good to see you again.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VERNONMAHABAL:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love the
fact that there's

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:84%
so much depth to this
subject because I've

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:90%
looked into it before.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:10%
I've even interviewed
other people on it.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:84%
But you're the first
one that's really

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:84%
gone into the soul's expression,
past life expression, et cetera.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, you're--
and that's deep stuff,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
deep one would
term metaphysical.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:90%
I'd say natural.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But you're also
starting to make it out

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:84%
into the more mainstream world
with this information, which

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:90%
is very encouraging.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So tell us why that's
happening because there's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:90%
a trend to everything.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And I know this
interest you as well.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Why is your art and are
the intuitive art starting

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:90%
to make it mainstream now?

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.433 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Well,
it's interesting.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I was just having a
conversation earlier today

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:90%
about this very subject.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:10%
After, let's say,
2000, the year of 2000,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:10%
and especially after
2012, the work that I do,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:10%
metaphysical work readings,
has become mainstream--

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:10%
psychic work,
astrology, numerology.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:10%
We're mainstream now.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:10%
So let's say in the early
'80s or '90s, if you said, oh,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.566 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to go see my
astrologer, people would say,

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:57.366 align:middle line:10%
what?

00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES] Yeah.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: But now, you could
say it in the same breath

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
as, oh, I'm going to
go to my chiropractor.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So our work, the metaphysical
work of giving readings,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:90%
is part of the culture now.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.155 align:middle line:90%
It's about time.

00:02:14.155 --> 00:02:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is about time.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.822 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I live in
a part of the world

00:02:16.822 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
where it's definitely
not mainstream.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of California.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Not mainstream but,
interestingly, certain things

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:84%
will hit even in
communities where

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:84%
their minds are very
much indoctrinated

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.585 align:middle line:90%
toward something else entirely.

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
things that will hit.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And palm reading seems to be
one of those divination tools

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.930 align:middle line:84%
that kind of is widely
accepted because we've all

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:90%
heard about it.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:84%
We used to see
the metaphorical--

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.357 align:middle line:90%
not metaphorical but give me--

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Like the
Gypsy palm reader?

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.898 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
what I was going to say.

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we all saw the Gypsy
palm readers growing up.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And so why is it you think
that hand reading in particular

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
is so much easier for
people to take on board?

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Well,
Regina, palmistry

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:84%
is a brother or
sister to astrology.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So anything that an
astrologer can see,

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
a palmist, a qualified,
seasoned palmist

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:90%
can see that in the hands.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the ancient
cultures, such as China, Japan,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Southeast Asia,
especially India,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:84%
even Europe in the
medieval times,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:90%
they used palmistry constantly.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:84%
It was just as well known and
as well used as astrology.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:84%
So palmistry gives
the same information.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And on a deeper level,
there's an entire extra level

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.730 align:middle line:84%
of metaphysical or
subconscious aspects

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
in the hand that are coming
directly from the soul.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.988 align:middle line:90%
And that deepens our work.

00:03:47.988 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: So when
a seasoned palmist

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
is looking at a
person's hand, they

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:84%
can really connect
with the subconscious

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:84%
aspect of what's radiating
from a person's palms.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And they can read
around the planet,

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, making the
reading even deeper.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.735 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're also a
seasoned at Vedic astrology.

00:04:12.735 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:90%
That's something that you do.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And so would you say
that it's in the stars

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.998 align:middle line:84%
that this time simply has
arrived, this time has arrived--

00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: That's a beautiful--

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to make the
new age the old age?

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not new anymore.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.942 align:middle line:90%
It's old.

00:04:26.942 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: That's a
beautiful way of saying it.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
I actually see, in
five or six years,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:84%
a resurgence of the
mind, body, spirit world.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
It's almost going to
become a renaissance.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:84%
It is going to
become a renaissance.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.897 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be a few years,
but it's starting to happen now.

00:04:46.897 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: So, for instance, if
you went into a Barnes and Noble

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
in 1990 and you asked
for an astrology book

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
or a palmistry book, people
who work there would say,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:90%
what are you talking about?

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, you go into a
Barnes and Noble,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.707 align:middle line:84%
and there's sections and
sections of metaphysical tomes.

00:05:08.707 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's going to
explode even further, though,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:90%
you say, in five or six years?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL And bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is good to know.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And
unfortunately, let's say

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.490 align:middle line:84%
the Judeo-Christian
ideas are going

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:90%
to go the way of the dinosaur.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.820 align:middle line:84%
It'll still be part
of our culture.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:90%
How can it not be?

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
But the metaphysical,
spiritual aspects

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.732 align:middle line:84%
of the mind, body, spirit
world, the New Age world,

00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely see it's
going to take off

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:84%
in a very big way, especially
after 2030, '31, '32, '33.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.803 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be, if you
will, the religion of the day.

00:05:43.803 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, it takes us
back to our roots,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
which is the nature of reality
and all of the influences

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:84%
that help us create
who we are as a soul.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And the religions
have come in sideways

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and cut us off from
that, unfortunately.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's time for us to
keep the good parts of religions

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
that serve humanity and
then let the rest of it

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.110 align:middle line:84%
die, the old discourse,
the old stories die.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking
about Vedic astrology.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
The whole aspects of Vedic
culture, for instance,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.956 align:middle line:84%
is that god and the goddesses
are seen as loving and warm,

00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:90%
not personages to be feared.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.450 align:middle line:84%
They're seen as the
personification of love

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:90%
and humility and magnanimity.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it's different in
the Judeo-Christian ethic.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, the generations

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that will come into that
world when they're 30 and 40

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.905 align:middle line:84%
will assimilate the more
Eastern ethics even stronger.

00:06:49.905 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And arguably, that's
where they were before once long

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:90%
ago, just reincarnating.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.808 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So actually,
it's in all of us.

00:06:55.808 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
It's comfortable within
all of us on a soul level.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just go back to an
external societal comfort

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:90%
with it, which is great.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And I also want
to say, do I have

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical readings
and intuitive

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
readings become mainstream?

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It's because people
are seeing a lacking

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
in going to a psychologist
or a psychiatrist or a career

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:90%
counselor.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Their work is just not
holding up to the fact

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:90%
that people want more.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:84%
They don't just want to know,
hey, what kind of a career

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:90%
am I going to do?

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.160 align:middle line:90%
That's an important part.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:84%
But now people are starting
to ask, well, who am I?

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose of life?

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.780 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Is there a God?

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.335 align:middle line:84%
And so that is coming
into our culture.

00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and a lot--

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:44.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: No, and
just with that,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:84%
people are asking for deeper
understandings of themselves.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.355 align:middle line:84%
And that can come through
astrology and palmistry.

00:07:54.355 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
the talk therapies,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
for example, aren't
really scratching

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:84%
down into the subconscious,
unconscious, and even

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
into past lives and
the influences that are

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:90%
making us cuckoo in the moment.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Absolutely.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:84%
A career consultant
could not tell you

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
what you did in your
past life or what

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.050 align:middle line:90%
they see for your future.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.940 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about--

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
you say-- and you believe with
all your heart because this is

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:90%
your life--

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:84%
that this is the most
powerful divination tool

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.780 align:middle line:84%
we have, that our hands
are the most powerful tool.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Explain why the hands.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Regina, it's
such an intimate divination.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
a person's hands.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
the configurations.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at the
placements of their fingers,

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
their thumbs, the whole
culture of their hands.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And so when people are getting
a reading from a palmist,

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:84%
they feel that much
more on a closeness

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and intimate aspect
than they even

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.170 align:middle line:84%
do with getting an
astrological reading.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Because many times someone
who is doing tarot,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:84%
the tarot reader will
understand the card,

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.310 align:middle line:90%
but the querent will not.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Or someone getting an
astrological reading,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:84%
the astrologer is
saying, oh, well, Jupiter

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:90%
is crushing into Mars right now.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.355 align:middle line:90%
So this is happening.

00:09:14.355 --> 00:09:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little
bit distant, you see.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
But when someone is
actually getting a reading

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're actually
looking at their hands

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and pointing things out,
they feel that closeness,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:90%
that connection, that communion.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Wow, this person is getting all
this information from my hands.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.860 align:middle line:90%
It couldn't be more intimate.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: You see.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.397 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes sense.

00:09:34.397 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: So I consider
it also the most powerful

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:84%
of the divinatory tools
because it combines astrology

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:90%
with intuition.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:90%
You can't separate the two.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Even the most
scientific, if you will,

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
palmist, who's only using
astrology for some time,

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:84%
will begin to become
more intuitive looking

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:90%
at hands daily, you see.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So it contains elements of
both the scientific elements

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
of hard astrology, if you
will, and the very deep

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.915 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical aspects coming
directly from the soul.

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that because you say,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
it actually tells you about
the constitution of your soul.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Your hands can tell you about
the constitution of your soul.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.780 align:middle line:90%
And what are you seeing?

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Regina,
We are eternal.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:90%
We are not this body.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
If one looks at
hands long enough,

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:84%
one can understand that,
actually, the soul is eternal.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's full of knowledge and
awareness, and it's happy.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:90%
It's joyful.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:84%
But while we're covered with
the material body and a material

00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:84%
mind full of material needs
and encumbrances and wants,

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:90%
we forget our eternal nature.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We forget our internal
awareness And we

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:90%
look for happiness externally.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And actually, happiness
and blissfulness and joy

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
are contained within the
soul and the connection

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.050 align:middle line:84%
with God, with the
higher intelligences.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And while we're embodied and we
identify with the material body,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that becomes something that we
completely are not aware of.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So the problem with
our society right

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:51.846 align:middle line:84%
now is that we have been
taught that we are our body.

00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:90%
We are Black.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:53.810 align:middle line:90%
We are white.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:90%
We are German.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:90%
We are Italian.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But we're not any of
these things eternally.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.880 align:middle line:90%
We're not this body.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And so if someone understands
that ultimately, they're

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:84%
not this body,
they're spirit soul,

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:84%
they're eternal, just that
idea will help someone

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:84%
to move forward and not take
the miseries of this world

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.435 align:middle line:90%
so seriously.

00:12:18.435 --> 00:12:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So you say that it shows
the constitutional nature

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what constitutional--

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: The
constitutional nature

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, as seen from
a palmistic point of view,

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:84%
is that the soul is
composed completely

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.060 align:middle line:84%
of love, of devotion,
of what's called bhakti.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And the soul's nature
is to give service.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:84%
That is what makes the soul
happy, to be of service.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And the soul's nature
is pure humility.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
When a person's soul is pure,
then they are naturally humble.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.910 align:middle line:90%
They're naturally tolerant.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't lament when they lose
things in the material world.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.793 align:middle line:84%
They don't even find that much
happiness when they gain things

00:13:10.793 --> 00:13:11.710 align:middle line:90%
in the material world.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.480 align:middle line:84%
They understand that the
most precious things are

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:90%
love and devotion and service.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's when
the purity of the soul

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
is really coming through
the third-dimensional life

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:90%
of the person that's embodied.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we call
that a type of mastery

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
or a type of enlightenment
when a soul can

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.290 align:middle line:90%
live purely through the body.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Do you see that in the hands
of people who do, do that?

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, yes.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:84%
In hands of men and
women who are saintly,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:84%
they move through this
world completely unattached

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.393 align:middle line:84%
from the encumbrances
of this material world.

00:13:54.393 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:84%
They use the facilities
of the material world,

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:90%
but they're not attached.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.323 align:middle line:84%
It's attachment that
brings suffering.

00:13:59.323 --> 00:14:01.282 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you were
looking at their palms

00:14:01.282 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
just as a broad stroke, because
we don't have a saint here

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:84%
present to read,
what would you say

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.860 align:middle line:84%
the broad stroke of a hand that
is unencumbered would look like?

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: They don't
have material desires.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.200 align:middle line:90%
There's no lust.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.400 align:middle line:90%
There's no greed.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.285 align:middle line:90%
There's no envy.

00:14:16.285 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:90%
They're free from this.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that
would show in the hands.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: That
shows in the hands.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:20.867 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:20.867 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And let's say the
most difficult hands to look

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:84%
at sometimes in
the way of people

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:84%
not having faith in
the spiritual aspects

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:84%
is that they're covered by lust
and greed and anger, you see.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.752 align:middle line:84%
Anger is the opposite
of love, you see.

00:14:42.752 --> 00:14:43.552 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:14:43.552 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And all this shows up.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.943 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: All this-- yes.

00:14:45.943 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And you can see--

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you mentioned
something a little bit

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
ago, which I had
never thought of.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
divert for a moment.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:84%
You were saying
that on the surface,

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:84%
we're not African American,
we're not Asian, Caucasian.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:84%
We're none of these things
on a soul level, very true.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:84%
However, when you
get into a body

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're imprinted
by your culture

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and your ancestral
belief systems,

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:84%
do you find that there
are collective patterns

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:25.050 align:middle line:84%
within different, say, racial
groups or geographical groups

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:90%
of people?

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, absolutely.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
whole mastery of life,

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
as we see in palmistry,
when a person becomes

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
aware of their devotional life,
is that they live in the world,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:90%
but they're not of it.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So there's no reason not to use
the facilities of this material

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.590 align:middle line:90%
We're part of it.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we do
have certain natures,

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.600 align:middle line:90%
certain cultures.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
part of us too.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, it's temporary.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
just this little glimpse.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It's going to change
at the end of the physical body.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm still curious.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if you're
among a group of people

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:84%
that has been
treated very badly,

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:84%
marginalized, not allowed
to fully express oneself,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.630 align:middle line:84%
does that show up in
that culture's hands?

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Oh, absolutely.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:84%
This all has to do
with karmic effects.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So if someone has put someone
through suffering in the past,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:84%
they have to taste that
result in the next life.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:84%
If someone has done very
good work in previous lives,

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:84%
they will achieve so much
good result in the next lives,

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Our activities in
this life directly

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
affect what we're doing in
this life and the next life.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and actually, there

00:16:58.795 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of people do
take kind of exception

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to that notion thinking,
well, wait a minute.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But if you have done something
that is out of integrity,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.880 align:middle line:84%
unkind to another
soul or a group

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:84%
of souls, that lowers your
vibrational frequency.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Everything is just
frequency, right?

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And so you're going to--

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: It's good question.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're going to find
a match for that frequency

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:90%
in the next incarnation?

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah,
and the idea here

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:84%
is that if we go
through suffering,

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.810 align:middle line:84%
we perpetrated suffering
on ourselves or others

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
before that, otherwise,
it's impossible for us

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:84%
to suffer if we didn't
perpetrate that.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:84%
The demigods and the goddesses
are delineating our karma,

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:47.890 align:middle line:84%
both good and bad, what we call
in Sanskrit akarma or moksha

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:90%
karma or pious karma, akarma.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
someone is going

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:84%
through collective suffering
or their own suffering,

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:84%
it's better just to
tolerate it and let it go.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way to deal
with difficult situations,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.030 align:middle line:84%
to just be tolerant, be
humble, and let it go.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.238 align:middle line:90%
Don't react, you see.

00:18:12.238 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's the challenge.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.113 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: That's the challenge.

00:18:15.113 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that has
to do with how advanced

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:90%
a person is as a soul, you see.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:27.430 align:middle line:84%
An advanced soul will say, hey,
I perpetrated this suffering

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:84%
on myself or others
in a previous life.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So let me just tolerate it, be
happy, and just move forward.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a very good point

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:90%
because it's not linear either.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a soul can
go through and develop,

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:84%
develop their qualities or
traits throughout lifetimes.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's some tidying
up to do from long ago,

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
another time just to finish it
off and offer a final lesson.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And, for example, humility--
so being exposed to

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
or having unfairness projected
upon them in a lifetime, that's

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:84%
a chance to be humble, which
is very hard for human beings

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:06.144 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: But humility
doesn't cost a dime.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And it makes one actually
very aware of what's actually

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
going on deeper behind
the scenes internally

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.780 align:middle line:90%
and externally.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Many times I will see
in somebody's hand

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that, let's say, a boy or a girl
had struggles with, let's say,

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
their father, or the father
was absent or difficult to work

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And 100% of the time, Regina,
it has to do with the fact

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that they were an absent
father or a difficult father

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:44.830 align:middle line:90%
in their previous life.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So they have to taste
the results of that.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, my job is to
say, hey, when you get older,

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.070 align:middle line:90%
be a good dad.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Be a good mom.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:90%
And break the cycle, you see.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.720 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of suffering
actually is for purification.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
in this material.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what we see in the hand.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.156 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if someone
sees suffering as purification,

00:20:07.156 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
oh, I went through this
in my previous life,

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I did this, let me just be
tolerant, be humble, and move

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:84%
forward, then they actually
become more advanced.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But a person who
blames others and--

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not good.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It has
the opposite effect

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.250 align:middle line:90%
because they're not learning.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Advancement of consciousness
comes from purification.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and I think
just in terms of language,

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I just call it
vibrational refinement.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: I like that.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything's
vibrating,

00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:90%
and it can vibrate low.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.280 align:middle line:90%
It can vibrate high.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But you really aren't
a match for the thing

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
doing at that moment.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You slot in
where your vibrations are.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.610 align:middle line:90%
So I like the way you put that.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And if someone sees--

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, it's difficult
in this day and age.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
But if someone sees
God in the universe

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
as friendly and favorable,
hey, whatever I'm going through

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:90%
is for my benefit, good and bad.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
If good stuff happens to
me, I offer the results

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:90%
to God and others.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And if bad stuff
happens to me, I'll

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.770 align:middle line:90%
tolerate it and try to learn.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what's the lesson here?

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And that person moves through
life with peace and balance

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:90%
and harmony, you see.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:90%
They don't blame others.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:90%
They blame themselves, you see

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] OK, so you say you
can see also the three--

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
going back to the functional
component part of the story,

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:84%
you can see three
distinct components

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:90%
of the soul in the hands.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:90%
What are those components?

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: In Sanskrit, it's
called sat-chit-ananda--

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, joyfulness,
and eternality.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
composition of the soul,

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:90%
pure love, pure devotion.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:84%
The constitutional makeup of
the soul is absolute love.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And so when one advances
in consciousness,

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:84%
they realize that,
actually, if I

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:84%
do things in love and
devotion, I will become happy,

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and I will have a good
effect upon others.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is not just
some energy or some--

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.680 align:middle line:84%
it's not just some
ball of energy.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a ball of light.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.230 align:middle line:84%
In the spiritual
world, we actually

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:84%
have a form, just like we have
a body now, but it's temporary.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
It's subject to birth and
death and disease and old age.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
In the spiritual world, we
actually have an eternal form.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:84%
We could be a boy or a
girl or a man or a woman

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:84%
or a great gandharva,
demigod, or something.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.250 align:middle line:90%
But that form never changes.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:84%
It never goes through death
or old age or disease.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's an eternal form.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:90%
So that's the goal.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can see
those three components again

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.095 align:middle line:84%
in the poem that you
were talking about.

00:23:04.095 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:84%
These are the three components
of the soul recognizable--

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.275 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Oh, absolutely,

00:23:07.275 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in the palm.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Absolutely.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can see what
level of development a person's

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:90%
at on the soul level.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.035 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Absolutely.

00:23:15.035 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Because the soul
is also emitting

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
knowledge of previous lives
and what this life is about.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's the repository of where
we've been and where we're going

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:90%
and what we're here to achieve.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, the soul shows
its eternality in that aspect

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.500 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's wonderful.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, so one of the big
things people want to know--

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and it can happen at
any age where they've

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:90%
gone through their lives.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:84%
They've taken responsibility,
paid the bills.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And even at retirement,
the retired and it's still,

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know
what I'm here for.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:84%
How advantageous might it
be if your parents could

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:84%
have a glimpse into
what you were here

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.150 align:middle line:84%
to do before this
whole journey begins?

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you say,
you can see what

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.774 align:middle line:84%
your dharma is, what your
true expression in life

00:24:16.774 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:90%
is in the palms, in your hands.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.058 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So your life purpose.

00:24:22.058 --> 00:24:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a moment

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
and give us a couple
examples of people

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
you've read, maybe when
they were a little younger,

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.522 align:middle line:90%
and saw how it turned out later.

00:24:29.522 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:10%
>>MAHABAL: Well,
that's interesting

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:10%
because in our culture, our
careers change so often,

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.530 align:middle line:10%
sometimes every 10 years.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:42.830 align:middle line:10%
When you look at someone or
you look at hands from old palm

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:10%
prints made out of
ink and like that,

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:10%
you see people who
grew up on a farm.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Their parents trained them.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And they work with alfalfa or
wheat the rest of their life,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.670 align:middle line:84%
or they work with a
lathe their entire life.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:03.770 align:middle line:84%
We see that in hands that are
100, 200 years old, let's say,

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:04.893 align:middle line:90%
prints, hand prints.

00:25:04.893 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: People learn their
trade from their parents,

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and they continued on that
throughout their lives.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And in this culture, it's
completely different.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.693 align:middle line:84%
It's like every 10 years, a
person can change a career.

00:25:16.693 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:90%
And we have to look at that.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do our
hands look schizophrenic?

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:90%
But let's hold on a minute here.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So your family
does raise alfalfa.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So you're born into this family,
and your prints are showing.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.510 align:middle line:84%
You're here to also
continue in the tradition.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So now you come to a world
that's corporate driven, where

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:84%
in corporate world, your
skills are salesmanship,

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:84%
maybe, or just keeping
things organized.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:90%
They're not so distinct.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can move around
even every few years

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.090 align:middle line:84%
if you want to in
the corporate world.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.660 align:middle line:90%
How does that show in a hand?

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not exactly
necessarily a dharma,

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that you have leadership
skills maybe, the dharma.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But most people working
in the corporate world,

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:84%
is that their dharma or for the
state government or whatever?

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.745 align:middle line:84%
How does that look in the
palms now of modern society?

00:26:05.745 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Well, I
have to say, Regina,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.182 align:middle line:84%
that most of the people I look
at are not in the right careers.

00:26:12.182 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
why I'm asking you this.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what I would guess.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: They're doing careers
that they're not born to do

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.760 align:middle line:90%
or acclimated so well to do.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's because our
society waylays us

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.295 align:middle line:84%
from doing the work
that we're here to do.

00:26:27.295 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.205 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And that's
also very difficult, too.

00:26:31.205 --> 00:26:36.831 align:middle line:84%
And that has everything to do
with that we're not really--

00:26:36.831 --> 00:26:42.182 align:middle line:84%
our society is not really
that grounded in that way.

00:26:42.182 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
the whole structure

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:90%
is ordered toward profit.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So how can you have
a grounded society

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.043 align:middle line:84%
that's ordered toward
profit, profit, profit?

00:26:50.043 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter where you go.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.270 align:middle line:84%
It's margins and profits,
whether it's, like I said,

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
governmental or corporate or
in corporatocracy in general.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.963 align:middle line:84%
Where is there room for a
person's soul expression

00:27:00.963 --> 00:27:02.880 align:middle line:84%
unless you claim it early
on and stay with it?

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It's
much harder with it.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It's much harder.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why in previous cultures
of hundreds and hundreds, maybe

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:84%
even thousands of
years ago, people

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:84%
would do their work that
they were born to do.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And they had time
for spiritual life.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:84%
They had time to
think, who am I?

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:90%
What am I here to do?

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
They had time to
cultivate thoughts

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:90%
of God and spirituality.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And in our culture, we're so
busy making a living at work

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:38.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're not even
acclimated to do.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.165 align:middle line:90%
We lose our spiritual culture.

00:27:40.165 --> 00:27:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.123 align:middle line:84%
So is this actually showing
up in people's hands--

00:27:43.123 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, it is.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --this
schizophrenic way of living?

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Schizophrenic,
I like that.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:52.624 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On a spiritual
level, it's schizophrenic.

00:27:52.624 --> 00:27:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, I have to
say that the soul is general--

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.720 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:07.950 align:middle line:84%
it is an entity that is god
conscious or goddess conscious.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:90%
That's just its nature.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But in our culture, we've
lost that natural inclination

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
to think of spiritual matters
because our leaders are bad

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.790 align:middle line:84%
People don't know what
saintly qualities are.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:33.563 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot of people
who have good examples.

00:28:33.563 --> 00:28:34.980 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot
of good examples

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.247 align:middle line:84%
of people who have morals
and standards and ethics.

00:28:37.247 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: That's the problem.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So here we are.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:43.570 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are right now.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.140 align:middle line:84%
But you said, too, that
in another five or six

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.680 align:middle line:84%
years, once we start getting
out to 2030, '31, '32,

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see
this vast change where

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:58.480 align:middle line:84%
we start moving back into mind,
body, spirit as a way of living.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: That's because our
current society, as it is,

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.258 align:middle line:90%
will go the way of the dinosaur.

00:29:05.258 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
we're going to reject it.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not working for us.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.467 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: It's not working.

00:29:09.467 --> 00:29:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in
another few years--

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that's not that very
many years away--

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:17.020 align:middle line:84%
my dream is to be able to see
people live their true dharma.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.060 align:middle line:84%
The thing that would
make me happiest

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:84%
is that humanity shows
up, and each person

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.360 align:middle line:84%
brings that natural talent and
skill of the thing they were

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.820 align:middle line:90%
born to do through and lives.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the
complexity of society

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and the peace that
would exist if everyone

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:35.600 align:middle line:90%
did what they were born to do.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.195 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And of course, I'm
a product of Western society,

00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:42.020 align:middle line:90%
and I love Western society.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
in Western society

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.670 align:middle line:84%
is that it's based on
sense gratification.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It's based on eating
and sleeping and mating

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:90%
and defending.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Whereas we look at the ancient
cultures and their culture

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.193 align:middle line:84%
was based more on
spiritual principles.

00:29:59.193 --> 00:30:00.860 align:middle line:84%
They understood they
weren't their body.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.660 align:middle line:84%
They understood they
were spiritual soul.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So the entire foundation
of their society

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:90%
was different than ours.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what's happening.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So here we are.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.065 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've gone
through industrialization,

00:30:12.065 --> 00:30:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and now we're watching
it start to decompose.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.517 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to watch

00:30:16.517 --> 00:30:18.160 align:middle line:84%
the resurgence of
our understanding

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.640 align:middle line:84%
of an absolute need for
our mind, body, and spirit

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:84%
to be integrated and offer
who we are to the planet.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, there are some
power spots on our hands

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that also can be used to work
with our psychic and intuitive

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.840 align:middle line:84%
forces, which we're needing
more and more because so

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.010 align:middle line:84%
much of the world is
just a flat-out lie.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.820 align:middle line:84%
What we're being presented is
just fabrication, delusion,

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.620 align:middle line:90%
lies.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:90%
All of us are sick of it.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:84%
We need to know how to use
our intuition more strongly.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So what are the power
spots on the hands?

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I just want
to make one comment based

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:51.800 align:middle line:90%
on what you were saying before.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Even though everything looks
very dark and dismal right now,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
astrological aspects,

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.470 align:middle line:84%
in about two, two
and a half years,

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:04.430 align:middle line:84%
the planets start moving
into very nice, auspicious,

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:90%
if you will, positions.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So the next year
and a half may be

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.550 align:middle line:84%
quite contentious and
difficult and a struggle,

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.060 align:middle line:90%
but we're actually moving--

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.750 align:middle line:90%
the future is bright.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well, we have
to move through the chaos

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:19.795 align:middle line:90%
and the destruction.

00:31:19.795 --> 00:31:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: The future is bright.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And personally,
I'm excited because, usually,

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
my being is almost always
future pacing things.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So even when things are
wonderful and bright

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and everything
seems to be flowing,

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll feel a little
unease in my belly

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:84%
because I'm feeling
what's coming.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to say-- and
my body is my tuning fork--

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited about the future.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'm already tapping
into those creative forces--

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: You are.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.225 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --pretty strongly.

00:31:43.225 --> 00:31:44.035 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: You are.

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So I agree.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It's bright, so not
to let this get us

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.465 align:middle line:90%
down this next year and a half.

00:31:49.465 --> 00:31:50.265 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:31:50.265 --> 00:31:56.170 align:middle line:84%
If a person's going through some
quandary or internal struggle

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.960 align:middle line:84%
or they just want
to, should I do this?

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Or should I do that?

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Should I take this job?

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Or should I take that job?

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Take your left hand and
put it on your heart

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and just leave it
there for a few.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Or just keep your hands
together in a clasping mode

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and just go internal for a few
minutes, maybe just a minute

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.880 align:middle line:84%
or two and just ask, hey,
what should I be doing?

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're
doing when you're

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.013 align:middle line:84%
bringing your hands
together or you're

00:32:23.013 --> 00:32:25.660 align:middle line:84%
putting on your heart,
especially this,

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:30.160 align:middle line:84%
you're bringing both brains
together, the right brain

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and the left hand.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And by amalgamating the two,
there's a symmetry and a harmony

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:35.900 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're feeling a sense
of indecision or confusion,

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:84%
put your hand on your
heart and just go internal.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Ask for guidance.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Ask for intuition.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:47.873 align:middle line:90%
Ask for insight.

00:32:47.873 --> 00:32:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's the best
way, the most direct way to--

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Like this.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --access it.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.257 align:middle line:84%
Does the right have
to be over the left?

00:32:53.257 --> 00:32:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Or it doesn't matter?

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Doesn't matter.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.965 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And
what it does is it

00:32:56.965 --> 00:32:59.040 align:middle line:84%
brings, like I say, a
harmony and a symmetry

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.890 align:middle line:84%
between both brains
and a peace together.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:06.580 align:middle line:90%
And then one can come up with--

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
definitely, an intuition or a
revelation will come through.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any other
little hacks like that

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.570 align:middle line:84%
of ways to activate
our psychic abilities

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.090 align:middle line:84%
or just stick with
this one as the best?

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I think these
are the two most powerful,

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:84%
holding your left
hand over your heart

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.160 align:middle line:84%
or keeping your hands
together, almost

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.620 align:middle line:84%
like in prayer form, because
this is what prayer means,

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:30.420 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're
asking for insight.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:36.740 align:middle line:84%
You're praying to God or the
higher powers, let's say.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Give me some insight.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.880 align:middle line:90%
Give me some awareness.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what to do.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting it both from
yourself and the higher powers.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about our hands collectively.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.320 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
that a moment ago

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.300 align:middle line:84%
of what you're seeing now in
people's hands as you read them

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and where you would start
seeing this kind of breakdown

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.490 align:middle line:84%
in society before
we break through.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.790 align:middle line:84%
What does that look
like in our hands?

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Well,
interestingly enough,

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:84%
Regina, I am seeing that
the generation that is like,

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:16.282 align:middle line:84%
let's say, 14 to 26, they are
an interesting generation.

00:34:16.282 --> 00:34:17.949 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I want
to talk about that.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:18.820 align:middle line:90%
That was my next question.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And I don't
mean that they're

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.895 align:middle line:84%
going to be moral in
a religious sense,

00:34:21.895 --> 00:34:23.020 align:middle line:90%
although that can be there.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But they are going to be very
much into right and wrong.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.300 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
very much into ethics

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.520 align:middle line:90%
and morals, high standards.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.860 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a very
different generation.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when they
become like, let's say, 40,

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.199 align:middle line:90%
we'll see the result of that.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:44.230 align:middle line:84%
But this generation from,
let's say, roughly from 13

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:49.719 align:middle line:84%
to 14 to 25, 26, 27,
they're going to be very,

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:84%
let's say, upstanding,
if you will, generation.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that classically
what's referred to as Gen Z?

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: I'm not sure.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I think that's--

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:57.139 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: I'm not really sure.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.556 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that's Gen
Z that you're speaking about.

00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:00.356 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:35:00.356 --> 00:35:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it is interesting.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was reading
an article this morning,

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:08.440 align:middle line:84%
a little news article of a
mother trying to figure out how

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:90%
to help her child through the--

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.350 align:middle line:84%
her child's old
enough to vote now.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And the child has their
blue hair and all of this.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
these are all bums.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I can't vote, in any conscience,
for any of these people.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And so parents are
going to have to learn.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't stick
these younger people

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
into the same kind of
mindset that you were raised

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.290 align:middle line:90%
in because this isn't working.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It's kind
of like Americans

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.730 align:middle line:90%
in the '50s and '60s and '70s.

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:39.200 align:middle line:90%
They built America.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.080 align:middle line:84%
They were an amazing generation,
the Silent Generation.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.800 align:middle line:84%
They had that
desire and that goal

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to build America,
make America strong.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.485 align:middle line:90%
That's going the way--

00:35:50.485 --> 00:35:51.950 align:middle line:90%
that's changing now.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't see a lot
of young people

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:58.270 align:middle line:84%
who are that patriotic
for better or for worse,

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that we don't really see
that, quote unquote, very

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:08.400 align:middle line:84%
goal-oriented, driven
ethic in their hands.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to
change, you see.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and I think
parents are kind of at a loss

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
to give guidance,
which in a sense--

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, that's where
it's so beautiful to understand.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:84%
If they're beginning to feel,
if they're-- are you seeing that

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.900 align:middle line:84%
they're more open, that
generation is more open

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to feeling their own talents and
a little bit more of their own

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:31.690 align:middle line:90%
mission in life?

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.148 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I am
seeing that they're

00:36:33.148 --> 00:36:35.620 align:middle line:84%
kind of going through
a lot of quandary.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.780 align:middle line:84%
They're a little
bit lost right now.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.485 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for them to assimilate
into society right now.

00:36:40.485 --> 00:36:41.360 align:middle line:90%
But that will change.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
we're still like,

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:90%
you graduate from high school.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.350 align:middle line:90%
You go to college.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:84%
You get a job in the corporate
world or the professions

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:51.148 align:middle line:84%
That's not going
to work for them.

00:36:51.148 --> 00:36:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It's not
working for them.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:56.520 align:middle line:84%
They're feeling, right now,
not very part of society.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.500 align:middle line:90%
They are feeling a bit lost.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what I see over and over.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I just have to reassure them
that just take some time.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.875 align:middle line:90%
Do things you like to do.

00:37:07.875 --> 00:37:12.355 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about having going
to college and getting a degree

00:37:12.355 --> 00:37:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and just staying in that all
your life because you're not

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:90%
going to.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:16.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a different world.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
different world.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they are a
breakthrough generation.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And like all
breakthrough generations,

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.988 align:middle line:84%
you're going to feel
a little out of sync

00:37:22.988 --> 00:37:24.310 align:middle line:90%
with the prevailing world.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.480 align:middle line:90%
But they have each other.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly,
their peers are

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.190 align:middle line:90%
going through the same thing.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Case in point,
I was talking to someone--

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and this was just
three days ago.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:37.300 align:middle line:90%
He was 25 years old.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:41.640 align:middle line:90%
He was going for an RN.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.150 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to become a nurse.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:44.710 align:middle line:90%
He wants to become a nurse.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.800 align:middle line:84%
He's not even sure that
he wants to do that.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.220 align:middle line:84%
So I was seeing in
his hand that he

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.900 align:middle line:84%
has this talent and that talent
and this talent and that talent.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:90%
And I just said, you know what?

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Explore everything right now
because it's a very difficult

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:00.740 align:middle line:90%
world right now.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.110 align:middle line:90%
And do the best you can.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:09.890 align:middle line:84%
In the '80s and the '90s,
it was so much easier to--

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Slot in somewhere.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, exactly.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And you know what, Regina?

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I see this all the time.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I rarely meet someone
who's, let's say, 40

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and is using the degree,
the college degree that they

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.955 align:middle line:90%
got when they were 20.

00:38:27.955 --> 00:38:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And so
that wasn't the case

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.740 align:middle line:90%
in the '50s and '60s and '70s.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And so this generation is having
a great difficulty fitting in,

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.990 align:middle line:90%
feeling, where do I belong?

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.250 align:middle line:90%
What am I here to do?

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a very difficult
time for them.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But this will change,
and they'll find it.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
what the parents can do now

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:59.220 align:middle line:84%
for this generation of people
from roughly 14 to 26 or so,

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:84%
people going into the
workforce, college,

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.930 align:middle line:84%
finishing up their
schooling, high school.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:09.390 align:middle line:84%
What's the best thing we can do
to not stymie who they truly are

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and to allow them to discover
their dharma at an earlier age

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.877 align:middle line:90%
than we ever did?

00:39:14.877 --> 00:39:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: I love that question.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Not put pressure on them.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Not put pressure on them.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Let them do what
they need to do.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.903 align:middle line:84%
We even see-- and I
see this in hands,

00:39:25.903 --> 00:39:27.320 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have
to be a palmist

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:31.010 align:middle line:84%
to see that-- that
they have interests

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:38.300 align:middle line:84%
or, let's say, opinions that
are so opposite each other.

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We see generations
before that that

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:46.280 align:middle line:84%
knew exactly what they wanted
to do and how they felt. Now,

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.560 align:middle line:84%
the generations that we
see, let's say, the 13, 14,

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and like that, they
have divergent opinions.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're not even sure
what they believe in.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, these parents
should just say, try this.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Try that.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Try this.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Try that.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:12.126 align:middle line:84%
And think about what you
want to do for the future.

00:40:12.126 --> 00:40:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Don't put pressure
on them to try

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.220 align:middle line:84%
to become successful
right now because it's not

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.570 align:middle line:90%
happening right now.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent advice.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:84%
We have to keep in mind
this is the generation

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:28.980 align:middle line:84%
that's been tasked with
starting this massive societal

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.360 align:middle line:90%
restructuring.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.620 align:middle line:84%
As adults, they're going to
have to build these structures.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And we will inherit them when
we reincarnate in the future.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Gen Z is a very, very
important generation,

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I think, the group
you're talking about.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I have
to agree with you.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I just see them as
amazing, amazing souls.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Smart.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Oh, incredibly--

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Smart.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: --incredibly
smart, very perceptive,

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.650 align:middle line:84%
able to see underneath
the surface of things.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they grew up
with the internet.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that they're just
getting their news from ABC,

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.490 align:middle line:84%
CBS, and NBC anymore and
whatever Walter Cronkite said,

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:07.290 align:middle line:90%
they believe.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Those days are over.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So this generation
is very perceptive.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And it also makes them unclear
about certain things, too.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
sure, they're young.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the brain doesn't stop
developing until we're what, 28.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So they have to go through
all this developmental stuff

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.328 align:middle line:84%
and then try to feel
themselves in the midst of it.

00:41:27.328 --> 00:41:29.620 align:middle line:84%
If we don't make so much
noise and put so much pressure

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:35.200 align:middle line:84%
on them, my hope is that they'll
be able to feel who they are

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and what they're here
to do at a younger age

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.105 align:middle line:84%
so they can participate in
this beautiful mosaic of what

00:41:41.105 --> 00:41:41.905 align:middle line:90%
our societies

00:41:41.905 --> 00:41:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Oh, Iove that.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --will look
like in the future.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: I love that.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're also seeing
that they're not

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.490 align:middle line:84%
fitting in because the
society that they're living in

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:52.700 align:middle line:90%
is coming to an end.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's
supposed to be--

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It's
coming to an end.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is all perfect.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they're just
left behind, not at all.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.460 align:middle line:90%
They've come to change things.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
going to feel out

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:84%
of sorts while the
old is still in place.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But that's not going to
be in place much longer.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And my prediction
is that when this--

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and I see this all
the time, Regina--

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.810 align:middle line:84%
when they become in their 40s,
they're going to know who they

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:14.650 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:16.550 align:middle line:84%
They're going to know
exactly who they are.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:20.860 align:middle line:84%
The generations from the '50s
and the '60s kind of understood

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:26.000 align:middle line:84%
themselves when they
were 22, 23, 24, 25.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.180 align:middle line:84%
The generation
after that started

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:31.262 align:middle line:84%
to understand themselves after
what we call Saturn return.

00:42:31.262 --> 00:42:32.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, after
28, and the 30s.

00:42:32.845 --> 00:42:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: After 28, 30.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.300 align:middle line:84%
This generation is going
to understand themselves

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.170 align:middle line:90%
when they're 40.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another
20 years from now.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of time to
really try to be their allies.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:46.340 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.600 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're precious.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.000 align:middle line:90%
We've got to support them.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.710 align:middle line:90%
So, Vernon, this is wonderful.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I love the depth of
this conversation.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And you have a very sweet soul
and understanding of what we all

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:00.770 align:middle line:90%
need to do to help each other.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.735 align:middle line:90%
And I very much appreciate that.

00:43:02.735 --> 00:43:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Well, thank you.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final thought
before we sign off today?

00:43:06.068 --> 00:43:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Well, if you look
at hands long enough for years

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and years, you
start to see that,

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.450 align:middle line:84%
actually, human
beings are very sweet.

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.370 align:middle line:90%
The soul is good.

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Even though we go through
very difficult circumstances

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and there's so many demonic
things going on in this world--

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:27.830 align:middle line:90%
let's be honest about it--

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.980 align:middle line:90%
still, we'll get through this.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.210 align:middle line:90%
We'll get through this--

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I feel a
very bright future.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: --because
the soul is good.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the soul is part and
parcel of god and the goddess.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Our nature is to be of service.

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.710 align:middle line:84%
We're happiest giving
a gift rather than

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.550 align:middle line:84%
getting a gift because
the nature of our soul

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:52.900 align:middle line:90%
is to help and heal.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
back to that now.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.510 align:middle line:90%
We will be.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:57.740 align:middle line:90%
And the future is bright.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Even though it looks
really dismal right now,

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:03.260 align:middle line:84%
any astrologer worth their salt
will tell you the same thing,

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.330 align:middle line:90%
that we see a bright future.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:07.100 align:middle line:90%
And it takes time.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it takes time.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:09.432 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: It takes time.

00:44:09.432 --> 00:44:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And this culture has been in
place for a good 150 years,

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:14.510 align:middle line:90%
if not longer.

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it does
take some time to--

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.132 align:middle line:84%
I hate to use the word
"break down," if you will.

00:44:20.132 --> 00:44:22.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The transformation
of large institutions

00:44:22.215 --> 00:44:23.420 align:middle line:90%
doesn't happen overnight.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:24.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's painful.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It breaks down
one brick at a time.

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: It's painful.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're several
bricks into it at this point.

00:44:28.975 --> 00:44:31.570 align:middle line:84%
One final quick question,
the younger generation

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that we've been speaking about,
Gen Z, our future transformers,

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.340 align:middle line:84%
maybe give us a couple
traits of their hands

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that is more common to that
generation than others.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And for example, I remember,
in our last conversation,

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.150 align:middle line:84%
you were talking
about this where,

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:49.690 align:middle line:84%
if people aren't able to
really open their mind

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and flow with the new
easily, oftentimes there

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.940 align:middle line:84%
will be a little bit of
stuck energy in the thumb.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Are you finding there are
certain traits of the younger

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:01.550 align:middle line:84%
generation that are more
common to them than en masse

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:02.730 align:middle line:90%
than before?

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, do you
get more activity there,

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
more open-mindedness,
more stubbornness?

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Or what do you get
in their hands?

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.410 align:middle line:90%
I do see a lot of confusion.

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I do
see, very, very deeply within,

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:25.600 align:middle line:90%
a strong will.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.690 align:middle line:90%
These are--

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which finger
is the will again?

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to put
it up, but which one?

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: The thumb.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The thumb?

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the thumb, what
you were talking about.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And it's
interesting because you

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.040 align:middle line:90%
were holding your thumb.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was just thinking,
hey, that's what I see.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
this is a generation

00:45:40.610 --> 00:45:44.330 align:middle line:84%
that, although they are
going through difficult times

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:47.670 align:middle line:84%
internally and externally,
at the same time,

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:53.400 align:middle line:84%
they do have an inherent,
strong drive and determination.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And they will be driven in a way
that's not just materialistic

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:02.820 align:middle line:84%
but driven as in they
have strong character.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Their character will be strong.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.150 align:middle line:90%
That's what I see.

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:08.352 align:middle line:84%
Overwhelmingly,
they will have-- not

00:46:08.352 --> 00:46:10.810 align:middle line:84%
to say that other generations
didn't have strong character.

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I love this.

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:13.850 align:middle line:10%
>>MAHABAL: But they will
have very strong character.

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:16.610 align:middle line:10%
And this is what I'm
seeing in the idea

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:19.990 align:middle line:10%
that they will be a
moral, if you will,

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:26.490 align:middle line:10%
generation, a generation based
on ethics and right and wrong

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:30.580 align:middle line:10%
and what is good for society.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.550 align:middle line:84%
They will be a very
upstanding generation.

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love this.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.875 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Character
is big in them.

00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Funny you should say
that because I just recently did

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.380 align:middle line:84%
a commentary that I put out
called Character is Destiny.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what we have to start
looking for in ourselves

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and each other is high
character logical traits,

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.480 align:middle line:84%
because that's the thing
that's going to pull us in away

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.930 align:middle line:90%
from the old and into the new.

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:57.190 align:middle line:90%
So I love that you said that.

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:58.660 align:middle line:90%
It was very validating for me.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:46:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Vernon, thank you so much.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.277 align:middle line:84%
We've gone a little
over our time,

00:47:01.277 --> 00:47:03.730 align:middle line:84%
but I'm glad you answered
that last question.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.090 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
will, which they need,

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to take us into these new
times when they become adults.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Regina, they're
not a weak generation,

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:16.500 align:middle line:84%
although they are operating
right now in very difficult

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.200 align:middle line:84%
situations, and they
may appear weak and--

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.890 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:24.520 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, inherently,
they're not a weak generation.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's all part of
the greater picture.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.990 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Vernon.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad to see you again.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Thank you.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.420 align:middle line:90%
It's been such a pleasure.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To learn more about
