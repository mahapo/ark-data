>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We've often spoken

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
about past life therapy and
making sense of our present

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.640 align:middle line:90%
from our past.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:10%
Less common is
progression therapy,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:10%
where we move into the
future, but the now

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:10%
is what gives us direction
as to where we're headed,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
what we're creating.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Gaia Chinniah is
here with us today

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to talk about how
we identify where

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
we are in our personal
soul blueprint

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.212 align:middle line:84%
so we know where
we might be going.

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Gaia, it's wonderful to
have you with us today.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.378 align:middle line:84%
And you have come here
literally on a very short trip

00:00:43.378 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:90%
from New Zealand.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GAIA CHINNIAH: I have
come from New Zealand.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's great to
be here in Boulder.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's a
little-- what's going on there.

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:84%
It's summer down
there right now.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Are we getting into the fall?

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: We're getting
into the cooler months.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're getting
into the cooler months.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
great having you here.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been
here once before.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'd like to
do is allow the audience

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:84%
to become familiar
with you by talking

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
about the way in which you
access, for your clients,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:84%
the present and the
future and how you start

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:84%
seeing these concepts
of time emerging

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.930 align:middle line:84%
into the blueprint of what
they're trying to do right

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:84%
now because I'm assuming
you're able to start

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:90%
seeing where the blockages are.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And it could have
been far in the past.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.092 align:middle line:90%
But is it ever in the future?

00:01:26.092 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: This is a really
interesting thing for us

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:90%
to discuss.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:10%
So when I'm about to
work with the client,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:10%
spirit will open up a
couple of portals for me.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:10%
And the portals are,
portal number one,

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:10%
an invitation of spirit
guides, ancestors,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:10%
and past life connections that
the client has around them.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:84%
The second portal is I travel
up through my crown chakra

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:84%
into the universe, into
different realms in which

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:90%
past lives are still occurring.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I access these, I
start talking about things

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.070 align:middle line:90%
that are very relevant.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know this because
I haven't allowed the client

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:90%
to speak to me yet.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But I'll start
accessing things that

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:84%
are really relevant for
the client right now.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:90%
So, for example, I had a client.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And before I even
started the session,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.880 align:middle line:84%
my eyes started to
involuntarily move.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And I began to see
things around me.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So I started to feel that
person and be able to see them

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:90%
for who they are.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.278 align:middle line:84%
And I started to see sacred
geometry come up around me.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, this
is an interesting thing.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:90%
I wonder who this client is.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So I access through
my crown chakra

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:84%
portal, a lifetime of this
lovely woman in front of me.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And she was in a room
with sacred geometry.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And she turns around
in that lifetime

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and says to me, tell her
that she drew all of this.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So I tell the client, I
said, we're in a room,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and you drew all of the
sacred geometry on these walls

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.460 align:middle line:90%
and you know how to read them.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And a male spirit
guide of yours is here

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:90%
saying that you know about this.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:90%
So I say this to her.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at me, and she
says, 25 years ago, Gaia,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:90%
I had a dream.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And a male spirit guide told
me that one day, someone

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.140 align:middle line:84%
would tell you how to
activate the sacred geometry.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you are
explaining to me now.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, so
when do you turn 65?

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:90%
And she said, next month.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's when
your activation begins.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:90%
So you need to see me before 64.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:90%
So it was very relevant for her.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:84%
She was at a time
in her life where

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of the
work on the human journey,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and now I want to step
into my spiritual gifts.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many people
like this at the moment, Regina,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:84%
that are having these awakenings
but don't quite understand how

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.642 align:middle line:90%
to move through these portals.

00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's an
interesting question.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So how did you get
her to activate it?

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Because as a healer,
my spirit guides work through me

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:84%
to activate it for
them, but she has

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
to be willing to
receive that gift.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So I can feel, as I was working
on her body at the same time--

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and this is all virtually
done because she

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:90%
was in another country.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
She could feel the
opening within her heart

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:90%
and her third eye.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's the transmissions
that we're having at the moment,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to
see from our hearts.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And she could see the meaning
of this lifetime from before.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And spirit had given
me specific information

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:84%
about who she needs
to be talking now

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:90%
to further activate that.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is the progression
part of the work that I do.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
You're given
relevant information.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I transmute what isn't
necessary anymore

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
but empower you to be able to
walk through your life knowing

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:84%
that you have a gift that spirit
wants you to use in this life.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And now is your time,
regardless of how old you are,

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:90%
because there is no time.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:90%
The soul is eternal as we know.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're all beginning to
make the shift into the soul

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:84%
perspective rather than the
density of the human experience.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did it
turn out that that is

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:90%
what she had done in her past?

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
She had worked with geometry
in the past as a healer?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.202 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: That's right.

00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So in the past life,
she had done that.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:84%
This had been of
interest to her.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And she'd had that
dream 25 years ago.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.180 align:middle line:84%
She just didn't know
what to do with that.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And so as I went on in
the past life story,

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
not knowing what work
she had done, I said,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I see the spirit guide
of yours saying to me

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that after you activate
all the sacred geometry,

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
you're in charge of
looking after all

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:90%
the artifacts in your village.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So I said, what have you done
for work in this lifetime?

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'm a
curator in museums.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think, Regina,
we actually all have

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:90%
these innate gifts within us.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just at certain
times in our lives

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:84%
when we're ready
to step into that.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:90%
And I feel that time is now.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
There's this real urgency where
I'm seeing a lot of people--

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure your viewers also
are experiencing these ascension

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:84%
symptoms, but
they're not sure how

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:84%
to step into that to be able
to activate their gifts.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we just have to
trust ourselves because I'm not

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:90%
trained in anything.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I was a corporate girl before
any of this began to make sense.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's when that veil
lifted from my eyes

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and I could hear
soul speaking to me

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:84%
when I had this completely
different perspective about what

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:90%
life is actually for.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
your own experience.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:84%
So you were a corporate girl,
like you say, and then an event

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:84%
The veil lifted over time, and
you started hearing and seeing

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:90%
other souls.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:90%
So let's go into your own past.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So you probably excavated
what you had done in the past

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and what you were bringing
forward from another time.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So where did you
bring this from?

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: So I went 33 years
thinking that I was somebody,

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:90%
the society that I came from.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I went to university,
got a master's degree,

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:84%
started my own
distribution company.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.632 align:middle line:84%
I had a prophecy that I would
say out loud to my partner.

00:06:38.632 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, something
amazing is going

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:90%
to happen to me when I turn 33.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was
interested in spirituality,

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
but it was never something
I'd imagine doing in the way

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing now or
helping people in the way

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.250 align:middle line:90%
that I was helping.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And pieces of the
puzzle have come to me

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.820 align:middle line:90%
over many, many years.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:90%
I just never put them together.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:84%
But now my job is to
put pieces of the puzzle

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:84%
together so I could
see my own preparation.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And prior to this
lifetime, I have

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.340 align:middle line:84%
had lifetimes where I've
been connected to Jesus.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up in a Hindu family
in this lifetime, Regina,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:84%
so Jesus wasn't someone
that I knew very well.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.400 align:middle line:90%
But my numerology is 33.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I had the prophecy of having
something happen to me at 33.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I feel people had
told me in the past

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that I carried Christ
consciousness energy.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the past lives that
I have been shown through me

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and also through other
practitioners who have read me

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:84%
have put me in this position
of being able to come into this

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:84%
quite quickly, having a short
33 years being in the 3D,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and then when that veil
lifted, realizing that other

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
people's souls were
communicating with me,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
asking to assist them in finding
their path and their soul

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.850 align:middle line:90%
purpose.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:90%
We all have it within us.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It's just trusting our ability
to know that we can step forward

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and we are being guided
if we allow ourselves to.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And so when I stepped
into that at 33,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I realized that many,
many lifetimes before

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
had prepared me
for this one, to be

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.230 align:middle line:84%
able to get in there so quickly
and identify what the issue is.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that there
are different categories that

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:84%
might help your viewers
actually in terms of soul levels

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:84%
that we come into
the world with.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm
working with a client,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
spirit will often say
to me, tell her or him

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:90%
that she's a teacher.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Tell her or him that
they're a healer.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Tell her or him that
they're a karmic balancer.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Tell her or him that they
are a savior or a sacrifice.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Tell her or him that they
are a bearer of light.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And that for me,
there's the opposite

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:90%
of all of those things too.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:84%
But usually, the people
that are coming to me

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:84%
are wanting to find
where they're sitting.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And I find that those
terms interchangeably

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.240 align:middle line:90%
move us through life.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So I've been a healer
in lifetimes before.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm a healer in this lifetime.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.260 align:middle line:84%
But I'm moving
into a teacher role

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
now where people
are coming, wanting

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
to know how to activate
their gifts, what they are,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.142 align:middle line:90%
so we can step into that power.

00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And are most
people comfortable

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:14.980 align:middle line:84%
with that when you
tell them, if it's not

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:84%
what they're up to right now,
you're actually a teacher?

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Are they happy to
hear this, or is it

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:84%
disconcerting to find
that maybe they're

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
not quite on the path their
soul intended just yet?

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Usually,
people will have

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.080 align:middle line:84%
some knowing that this is what
they're meant to be moving into.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are shocked when
spirit gives them that message.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:90%
They're like, me?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.480 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.120 align:middle line:90%
What am I meant to-- who am I?

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Imposter syndrome
is a huge thing.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:90%
But we're all human beings.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I always let people
know, I'm a person.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:90%
I have my own issues too.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just that with
my ability to see,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:84%
I can piece the puzzles
together more easily.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
I'm wanting people

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to do also in their lives, is
that all these synchronicities

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:84%
that are happening in your
life are showing you something.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.590 align:middle line:84%
It's connecting you to something
deeper and something more

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people are in
that state of not wanting

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:90%
to see yet their true power.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And my job from that soul
perspective is to empower them.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So most people are happy
to receive that information

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and take it as a
great gift of like,

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, I feel confident in stepping
into sacred geometry now,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
or I feel confident in moving
into being a sound healer.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think when people come
to me or to anyone they go to,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
they want to be seen and
understood and validated

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:90%
for what they already know.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And have
that reflected back.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So are you seeing some
kind of consistency

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
in what blocks us
in terms of all

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
of these different people
coming from their own past,

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:90%
their futures, their presents?

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Are there patterns
that you're seeing

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how
we block ourselves

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:84%
from our destiny
in this lifetime?

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: This is a
really interesting topic.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.480 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing that
I've been noticing,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
last one year, is

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.720 align:middle line:84%
that when I first
began doing this work,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that people
were able to have

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:84%
a successful
career, for example,

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.070 align:middle line:84%
and maybe a relationship that
wasn't working out so well.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:84%
They got their pride
from their life

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:90%
from one area of their life.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But the lifetimes and the realms
that I'm traveling to now,

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.730 align:middle line:84%
what spirit is showing me
for all of us to consider

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.797 align:middle line:84%
is that we can actually
have everything.

00:11:29.797 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Sure, there's going
to be our lessons,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:90%
but it's all interconnected.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I
had a lifetime where

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I was working with a client, and
I could see a hundreds of years

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And she was working
in a brothel,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and she was the dance
teacher in the brothel,

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:84%
teaching the women how to move
and how to entertain the men.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:90%
And then she would go home.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And I followed her into her
village where she lived.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And she had found out that
her partner, her husband

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
had had an affair and
transmitted to her a disease.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.705 align:middle line:84%
And when I told her this,
they even gave me the age.

00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
She turned around and said
to me, in that lifetime,

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
at 47 in this lifetime,
this happened to you.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I said to her, at 47 in
this lifetime, what happened?

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:90%
And she said, exactly that.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And so how this
correlates to the patterns

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:90%
is that she's very stuck.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:84%
This person's very stuck in
stepping forward into her gifts

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:90%
and what she wants to do.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But the correlation
is actually directly

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
to being rejected,
having resentment,

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:90%
having your heart closed.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that needed to be
transmuted in the heart space

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:84%
before she could
actually have the vision

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:84%
to step forward and
progress herself.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's the pattern.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:84%
For everybody, it's
different, obviously,

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
but I'm noticing that one
cannot work without the other.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything is being asked
to be dealt with now.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's a lot of
reconciliation of past life

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.758 align:middle line:90%
patterns at this time.

00:12:51.758 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:90%
I would think there always are.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But is it maybe even increasing
in the speed at which things are

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:90%
needing to be transmuted now?

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: It's
really, really fast.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:84%
The way that spirit is
delivering this information

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:84%
with such precision with the
age, the time, where you live.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.040 align:middle line:84%
When I look at the
soul map, the specifics

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
are hitting clients
like, oh my goodness,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:84%
that is something that is I've
experienced just recently.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's the unblocking,
the reconciliation of that

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.850 align:middle line:84%
because we have the ability
to rewrite our stories

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and look at them from a
different perspective.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when we access or
if you receive information

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:84%
about your lifetime before,
spirit actually gave me

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:84%
a really great acronym called
CAP, C-A-P. And so I said

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.238 align:middle line:90%
to spirit, what's that mean?

00:13:40.238 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said to me, well, when
we give you this information,

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:84%
meaning to the client
or even to myself,

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:84%
you either can change something,
you can accept something,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:84%
or you can prepare
for something more.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:90%
And you get to choose.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
That's your free
will going, OK, no, I

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
don't want this to repeat again,
so I'm going to have to change.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm noticing that
the activations that

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:84%
are happening in the
heart are enabling

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:90%
us to see from the heart.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So when people draw
the connection like,

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.870 align:middle line:84%
oh my goodness, I
can see why I've

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
been afraid to step into
my healing abilities

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
or afraid to start this
business or change career,

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
it's actually directly
correlated to something else,

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:84%
which is usually
they've been hurt.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:90%
They've been rejected.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.710 align:middle line:90%
They've not been seen.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle line:90%
There's been infidelity.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'm seeing a lot of that.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you are looking at
an issue in your life--

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:90%
why am I not moving?

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:90%
What's this obstacle?

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Look at the other areas
that have held you back

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.623 align:middle line:84%
and that's where you
want to be reconciling

00:14:32.623 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and that will free you
up to move you forward.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.248 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
a very good point.

00:14:36.248 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And the point you made
earlier on, which is it's

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:90%
never too late.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
With the woman who was
coming to her 65th birthday,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a
really critical point.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Because once you have
transformed or transmuted

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.787 align:middle line:84%
learned in a lifetime,
that's learned.

00:14:50.787 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you have
to come back and keep

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:90%
relearning the same thing.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you learn at the last
minute or if you learn early on,

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:84%
The point is to learn because
now there does seem to be--

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:84%
well, you talk--
we're going to talk

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
about a collapse in
timelines in a minute.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But let's say a perceived
speeding up as the Earth

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
goes through her own
refinement and is stepping up

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.650 align:middle line:90%
in her own frequencies.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:84%
We got to stay with her,
or we can't stay here.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: That's right.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So we have to learn.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is an urgency
that wasn't there before.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.775 align:middle line:90%
Not that it's all over.

00:15:21.775 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:90%
We go somewhere else.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to
stay with Earth,

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
if we want to stay with her soul
tribes that we've developed,

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:90%
we have to upgrade.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: We do.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And these upgrades are very,
very accelerated right now.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.568 align:middle line:84%
And people are experiencing
these ascension symptoms.

00:15:37.568 --> 00:15:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people have
been coming to me going,

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:90%
what do we do with this?

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm having heart palpitations.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm feeling my
crown chakra tingling.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:90%
And my third eye is opening.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And these are not
comfortable feelings, Regina.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:90%
They can be very uncomfortable.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
But spirit always gives me
information in layman's terms

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not
trained in anything,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:90%
except it's purely innate.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I look at
it is that we're all devices.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
All of us are human
devices on Earth.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And the universe, the
spirit guides, we're

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:90%
connected to the motherboard.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
devices are outdated.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Some are going to expire.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Some need to be upgraded.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:84%
We're all moving
at different times.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
But this is the merging and the
collapsing of the timelines.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be an
upsurgence of this

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
that is happening so
quickly that people

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
are panicking about the
feelings that they're having.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
But we just need to ride
through that wave and trust that

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.870 align:middle line:84%
process because we are all
here at this time for a reason.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
We are greatly supported by
spirit guides, by Mother Earth,

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:90%
by the universe.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And once we're through
those feelings of awakening,

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.200 align:middle line:84%
you will feel the sense of
lightness and connection

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:90%
that you probably realized.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
We know that through anything
we perceive as bad or difficult,

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:84%
there's always the light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is this
accelerated ascension,

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a light at
the end because you are light.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
You are this light that is being
connected with and communicated

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:90%
with the motherboard.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And we do need to
keep up with her

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
to keep up with all the massive
changes that are happening.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and just to
continue reincarnating here

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.290 align:middle line:84%
if we choose to do that,
if we want to do that.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: That's right.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, not
everybody wants to.

00:17:18.418 --> 00:17:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to
try something new.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.599 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's a prisoner here.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's really
important to understand.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:90%
It's all frequency.

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
If we don't come back here, we
can come back somewhere else.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.535 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: And I
think a lot of people

00:17:30.535 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
think that Earth is the
main event for all of us.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But I've been seeing
a lot of souls coming

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:84%
to me from the different
realms, a lot of energies

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
that are not human that are
also coming through for clients.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's life everywhere
in different forms

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and different vibrations
and different portals.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And being grounded helps to
be able to step through them

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:90%
and come back.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
for us to do that.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.465 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's
absolutely happening,

00:17:59.465 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:90%
and it's happening quickly.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And before we go into time
and space and timelines

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:84%
collapsing and so forth,
let's just take one moment

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:90%
because so many people--

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure people that
come to you and so

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:84%
many people that I hear
from are saying, I'm done.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:84%
This is too difficult.
I'm not coming back.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a very common statement.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm done with this.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.090 align:middle line:90%
It's too hard.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not coming back.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So from your perspective,
when you're looking at them,

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:90%
what would you say?

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: I think that
because of the work that I do,

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.610 align:middle line:90%
it's never my opinion.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:84%
It's what spirit teaches me
through what I see for clients.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I do feel that we
have a contract

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.962 align:middle line:84%
as such in the number of times
that we're going to come back.

00:18:44.962 --> 00:18:46.670 align:middle line:84%
But the faster that
we learn our lessons,

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.655 align:middle line:84%
Regina, the more that we
don't have to be here.

00:18:48.655 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when
I get in there

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and try and break a
blueprint for somebody

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and hope they step forward
into that and understanding

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:84%
that lesson, I mean,
I've had those moments

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.730 align:middle line:90%
when I say that too.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Like, OK, I'm done here.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I'm there.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think everybody has.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, my
understanding is

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:84%
there's a great deal that
can be done here compared

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:84%
to many other places
where there are far

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:84%
few opportunities
for learning, where

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:90%
everything happens more slowly.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.100 align:middle line:84%
There are beings waiting
to incarnate here

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:84%
for the opportunity
that this place offers.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: I know.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, life
can be beautiful

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.765 align:middle line:90%
if we perceive it that way.

00:19:25.765 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel like--
someone said to me recently,

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.265 align:middle line:84%
how would we know what chocolate
tasted like if we didn't

00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:31.730 align:middle line:90%
come to Earth to taste it?

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like we're here to
have this tactile experience

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
with one another and
remember each other

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:90%
and hold space for each other.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that enjoying
the period of time

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that we can while
we're here prepares us

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
for the next lifetime
if we are coming back

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and if we choose to come back.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:84%
But as you mentioned, the
souls that are coming in,

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
they know exactly why
they're coming in.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
I was probably one

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
of those floundering
around going,

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:90%
oh god, what am I meant to do?

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Am I meant to be
this corporate girl?

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Am I meant to be this healer?

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that are
coming in know exactly what

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.270 align:middle line:90%
they're coming for.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:08.062 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to need
to be teaching them

00:20:08.062 --> 00:20:09.275 align:middle line:90%
what they need to be doing.

00:20:09.275 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm hearing this
from quite a few people.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.858 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: They'll
be teaching us.

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:84%
because that does have to
do with the nature of time.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Some people even perceive
that these beings are beings

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:90%
from the future, for example.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that,
that have come clear

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.610 align:middle line:84%
of purpose and directive and
what they're here to help

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.760 align:middle line:84%
do in ushering Earth's
people, in humanity forward.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Earth is fine, but
ushering humanity forward.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Yeah.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel that a lot
of them have had future--

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.367 align:middle line:84%
They're in future
realms knowing what

00:20:44.367 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:84%
we need so that's why
they're coming back in time.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, so
let's talk about that.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.225 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: They're
coming back in time

00:20:49.225 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:90%
to be able to guide us forward.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually
nothing to fear.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.460 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like--

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and as humans, we get
into that fear space

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
because we're being told to
be afraid by of certain things

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and not to trust ourselves
and to be disconnected.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's been more
changes in the last 100 years

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.540 align:middle line:84%
than there has been in
the last 100,000 years.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we wonder
why we're overwhelmed.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:09.843 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Exactly.

00:21:09.843 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:90%
And also just so disconnected.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the beings that are
coming through the souls that

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.140 align:middle line:84%
come-- because I see
lights coming into the body

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
when someone's
going to conceive.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And I see them leaving
when perhaps there's

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.230 align:middle line:84%
going to be a loss because that
child's not ready to come in

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:84%
or preparing the mother
or whatever it is.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are beings
coming from the future that

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
will be guiding
us into the light

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.120 align:middle line:84%
even further, where we
won't be floundering

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:84%
for such long periods of time
and not being so disconnected

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and really embrace
the Earth journey

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:84%
rather than being
here not knowing

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:90%
what their sole purpose is.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's many people
like that, Regina,

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:84%
who are here on Earth that are
still trying to find their feet.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:10%
But we are being guided.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm being guided
every day as you are.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just about
opening yourself up

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to that heart receptivity
to actually-- spirit

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:90%
showed me this.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can visualize
this heart open--

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
this eye opening up
within your heart.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:84%
They tell me, see
from your heart.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.230 align:middle line:84%
You're not seeing from
your mind anymore.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing from your heart.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you start training
yourself to do that,

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:84%
you start being able to
perceive certain things

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:90%
for the future, who's coming.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the people
that I see, they've

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:84%
already got an inkling
about the type of child

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:90%
that they're getting.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm there just
to connect the dots of,

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:90%
why did they choose you?

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is one
of those things that I

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
don't-- it's not commonly known,
but I do this for people before

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:32.780 align:middle line:90%
the baby's born.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.883 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk with the entity
and help the parent understand

00:22:35.883 --> 00:22:36.800 align:middle line:90%
what they're here for.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And the entity is
very clear what

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:90%
they're here for at that time.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:84%
However, I've watched, over the
years, some of these entities

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.250 align:middle line:90%
who were born grow up.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is what's interesting.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
The clarity is there
certainly before birth.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.362 align:middle line:90%
Then you come into the vehicle.

00:22:52.362 --> 00:22:53.162 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:22:53.162 --> 00:22:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you're exposed to
every type of programming

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.190 align:middle line:90%
there is in the world.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And so this, to me,
becomes a real issue

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:05.140 align:middle line:84%
of having parents more awake and
conscious and aware so that when

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:84%
that child is doing certain
things when they're little,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.320 align:middle line:84%
you can already see their
passions and proclivities.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And you don't try
to stomp it out

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.660 align:middle line:84%
to have them fit in
this world because I've

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.138 align:middle line:84%
noticed some people went off
the path that they intended.

00:23:19.138 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: That's right.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the people
that I end up seeing,

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.850 align:middle line:84%
the people who are like,
I've trained to do this,

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.990 align:middle line:84%
but that's not really
what I want to do.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.490 align:middle line:84%
The number of people
that I'm seeing

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:84%
is in the collective who
are not happy with what

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:84%
they're doing and wanting to
step out and do something else.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The guidance around that from
spirit has been, just do it.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to give
up what you're doing now

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:84%
but step into what
your true passions are.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to turn
everything into something.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Some people--

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
all or nothing.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: That's right.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not all or nothing.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.035 align:middle line:84%
This is why spirit's
been saying to me,

00:23:51.035 --> 00:23:52.160 align:middle line:90%
you can have it all, Gaia.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Just step into it.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Keep stepping forward.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Keep stepping forward.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, we all came in
with certain amount of clarity.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And then through our social
conditioning and what

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.110 align:middle line:90%
the world tells us who we are--

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We lose it.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's really to the
parents to preserve that,

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
to be aware and watch, notice
what the genius in each

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:84%
of these little people
that we bring in the world

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:90%
and encourage it.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Yes, encourage it.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will be
seeking out scans and things

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:17.940 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But like you know,
this information

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
about the core information
of where your soul is

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.750 align:middle line:84%
coming from, this child's soul,
and being able to, like you say,

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:84%
preserve that, cultivate
that, see that child,

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.270 align:middle line:84%
see that light and that
child for who it is

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and what it's here for and how
you're going to support that,

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a happier
human later on and one that's

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:84%
not going to be holding
any resentment towards you

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.460 align:middle line:84%
or feeling rejected or
needing validation, which

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
has been the issues that
a lot of the practitioners

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.567 align:middle line:90%
are dealing with at the moment.

00:24:48.567 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We talked
about this a moment ago.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's go through collapsing
timelines and portals

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and tell us how that works.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.723 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: So what spirit's
been showing me is that--

00:24:59.723 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and this is a simple
thing for a lot of people

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:90%
to try and visualize at home.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.857 align:middle line:84%
We have to believe that
the portals are there.

00:25:04.857 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see them
through my third eye.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And because the portals of the
heart chakra and the third eye

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and the crown chakra, the higher
portals that are opening up,

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
we can actually
step through these

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:90%
to be able to awaken further.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Portals open up for me at
certain times of the year.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I find that around
equinox period of time,

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:84%
there are portals that
open up that we are being

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:84%
asked to step through, which
enables us to travel and come

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In time.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: In time.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I do
on a day-to-day basis,

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.550 align:middle line:84%
is travel through time
and then come back.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I can often feel nauseous
when I've traveled

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and come back because I'm like,
OK, I'm back on Earth again.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But the collapsing and
the merging of timelines

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:84%
is that it's happening
a lot quicker.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.170 align:middle line:90%
It's happening a lot quicker.

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's more pressing
issues to deal with now

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.670 align:middle line:84%
because when I first
started doing this work,

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.530 align:middle line:84%
spirit would bring
up lifetimes that

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
were interesting to
the client but not such

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
a pressing issue that's being
needed to be dealt with now.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:90%
And so there's this--

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 10-minute
urgency that's happening.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:06.942 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: There's an urgency.

00:26:06.942 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Spirit actually said to me,
people always focus on the how

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and the when, but what they
should be focusing on is the now

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and the then, meaning how far
we've come, what we've learnt,

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.320 align:middle line:90%
what we've changed.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's in this
lifetime or not,

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:84%
we can still track and
measure how far we've come,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.050 align:middle line:84%
not living in the past but
using that as a catalyst to be

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.642 align:middle line:90%
able to move into the future.

00:26:33.642 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Because often people focus on,
how is that going to happen?

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.607 align:middle line:90%
When is that going to happen?

00:26:37.607 --> 00:26:39.565 align:middle line:84%
Those are the worst
questions to ask a medium--

00:26:39.565 --> 00:26:40.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:26:40.135 --> 00:26:41.275 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Because
there is no time.

00:26:41.275 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There is no time.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:90%
And the more

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: And spirits
very clever in how

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.700 align:middle line:84%
they deliver this
information to us.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:84%
If we hold on to
the timing, it's

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.620 align:middle line:84%
not going to happen
in that time frame.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And so with these portals, it's
like as we step forward and come

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.570 align:middle line:84%
back, we're getting those
upgrades and the ability

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:84%
to travel and understand
ourselves and use

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:02.955 align:middle line:90%
that information.

00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's the
pressing issues that

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:84%
are coming up now,
as I mentioned,

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.610 align:middle line:90%
rejection, abandonment--

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's human.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: That's human.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.207 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems
that most people have

00:27:13.207 --> 00:27:15.820 align:middle line:84%
some element of abandonment
just because of the nature

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.237 align:middle line:90%
of how humanity has come to be.

00:27:17.237 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Exactly.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's where accessing the
portals are amazing because you

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.050 align:middle line:84%
go and you get insight
and then you come back

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and you have the soul
perspective of nothing

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:90%
is good or bad.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Everything is an experience.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:29.870 align:middle line:90%
What is it for?

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:90%
What is it teaching me?

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to use that
as part of my soul purpose?

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:84%
How am I progressing
from this information,

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:90%
not holding me back?

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to change?

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to accept?

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Or am I going to prepare
for something more?

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
These portals are opening
up to help us remember.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you're currently
experiencing these

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:52.150 align:middle line:84%
or have this feeling that there
is a portal opening up for you,

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:84%
your spirit guides will support
you in stepping in and out.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But they're usually
equinox times for me

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.020 align:middle line:90%
for whatever reason.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I will start feeling heart
activations going on.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And I have a spirit
guide named Makursha.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.890 align:middle line:84%
He will often drop these
webs of light in front of me,

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:12.110 align:middle line:84%
asking me to step forward into
the light and then step back.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:90%
So this is the merge.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:90%
It's all just speeding up.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:84%
It's no more, we've
got a lot of time.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like we need to do this now
in order to fulfill our life's

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:90%
experiences here.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So even though
we were talking also

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.990 align:middle line:84%
earlier on about how
everything is actually,

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.400 align:middle line:90%
it's happening right now.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness,
our moment is now.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Are there times when
you're speaking with people

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.000 align:middle line:84%
that you're being
shown that you need

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to start evolving
this part of yourself

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.550 align:middle line:84%
now because in your
next incarnation or two

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:43.060 align:middle line:84%
incarnations from now, this is
really going to be called upon?

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:90%
Are you seeing more of this?

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Maybe give us an example.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.128 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:47.128 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So I live in New Zealand, and
the Indigenous people there

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:90%
are the Maori.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I see a
client of Maori heritage,

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:56.182 align:middle line:90%
they are very, very--

00:28:56.182 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:84%
anyone of Indigenous heritage,
whether they know it or not,

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.500 align:middle line:84%
they're very, very
connected spiritually.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And I see that because
my room will just

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.260 align:middle line:84%
start filling up with ancestors
and spirit guides more so

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.710 align:middle line:90%
than the average person.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And I recently had a
client, a beautiful woman.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And I remember her
because of her story.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:90%
And I had a spirit come through.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.690 align:middle line:90%
And it was a Maori gentleman.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the client,
are you of Maori heritage?

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.590 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah, I am.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.670 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:25.378 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that
she had two fathers.

00:29:25.378 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her, have
you got two fathers?

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:90%
She said, I do.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So I was trying
to piece together

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:90%
the puzzle, what's going on.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I saw a couple
of lifetimes for her

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:38.080 align:middle line:84%
in the future where
she's fully stepped

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.790 align:middle line:90%
into her Indigenous powers.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.270 align:middle line:84%
But right now, she
was of mixed heritage,

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Maori father, European mother.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.347 align:middle line:84%
And she's feeling
really stuck around what

00:29:49.347 --> 00:29:51.430 align:middle line:84%
she's meant to be doing
with her healing abilities

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:84%
because I could
immediately feel I've

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.850 align:middle line:84%
got a healer in front of me,
regardless of what she's doing.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.160 align:middle line:90%
So I told her this.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And what spirit started telling
me is that she's not connected

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
to her Maori heritage,
and therefore, she

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:07.160 align:middle line:84%
hasn't taken the acronym
CAP of accepting who she is.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I questioned her
about this a little bit more.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, I don't know
my Maori side of the family.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:84%
She said, I believe
I'm born from incest.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And so nobody talked to me
about that side of the family.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And so then the spirit
that was there of her,

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:84%
the biological
father was saying,

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:84%
so I'm here to help
her heal, to connect

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.410 align:middle line:84%
with that side of the culture
so that in this lifetime,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:90%
she can start stepping forward.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But in the future
lifetime, she can fully

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:84%
embrace her powers of just
coming in as a Maori healer

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.770 align:middle line:90%
and being able to embrace that.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is the familial,
ancestral healing

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that's happening through spirits
that are coming through that--

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.480 align:middle line:90%
you may not know.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.330 align:middle line:90%
This is her father.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
She did not know him,
never seen him before,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.180 align:middle line:84%
but that acceptance
of who you are.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Even I went through
that, Regina.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm of Sri Lankan descent.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.520 align:middle line:90%
I lived in New Zealand.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I was the only colored
person at school.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.840 align:middle line:84%
There was this disassociation
from who I was.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And then once 33 came, it was
like, I have to accept who I am.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I have to accept-- if I'm going
to be helping people accept who

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.200 align:middle line:84%
they are, I have
to accept that this

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.680 align:middle line:90%
is the package I've come in.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, that
is happening also.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I always let clients
know, when you

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:84%
have this type of
healing and information,

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:84%
it is preparing you for future
lifetimes but also this future

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.770 align:middle line:84%
as well because this
is the one that we're

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:90%
more conscious of having.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting
and exciting time

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:90%
for healers stepping up.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it really is
because, well, first of all,

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:90%
we all need healing ourselves.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And we could all use
the help of each other

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.950 align:middle line:90%
that have these capacities.

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And it is interesting because as
I noticed as I interview people

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and we go along, it's
being called upon for us

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to remember the nature
of our ability to heal.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So as with this woman, as
you're saying, to bring back

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.200 align:middle line:84%
her Indigenous ways
of healing will be

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.612 align:middle line:90%
very important in the future.

00:32:00.612 --> 00:32:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Absolutely.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Because that connection--
as you say, all of us

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:08.300 align:middle line:84%
healers, mediums, we all see
things from our perspective.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.420 align:middle line:84%
We're given information
in different ways.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who are all
aligned, every person you go to

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.670 align:middle line:84%
will be giving you
similar type of thing

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
but in a different
way so you can build

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:90%
that piece of your puzzle.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.090 align:middle line:84%
But we are being asked to
remember because a lot of people

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.200 align:middle line:84%
know they somewhat
have this desire

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.690 align:middle line:84%
to step into their healing,
but they don't know what it is.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So they're accumulating
a lot of information

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.698 align:middle line:90%
from everywhere else.

00:32:31.698 --> 00:32:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's nice to
know your direction.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: That's right.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you can
really own it and develop it.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Yeah, but spirits
really encouraging us now,

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:84%
you've already got
that information.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:44.130 align:middle line:84%
For me, I just have to trust
that what comes out of my mouth

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and the healing that happens
is what the client needs.

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:48.100 align:middle line:90%
And it always is.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But if I start overthinking
it and anybody else

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.810 align:middle line:84%
starts overthinking,
like can I do this?

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Is this right?

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.472 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get in
the way of ourselves.

00:32:55.472 --> 00:32:57.388 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with her,
it was already in her,

00:32:57.388 --> 00:32:59.305 align:middle line:84%
and she just has to
accept and develop it now.

00:32:59.305 --> 00:33:00.888 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: And
accepting the heritage

00:33:00.888 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:84%
because this is the part
of the soul mapping.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.980 align:middle line:84%
We come in these
packages for a reason

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and come from the
cultures for a reason.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us our own edge
as well in this lifetime

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.800 align:middle line:84%
to be able to step
forward into why we've

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.588 align:middle line:90%
chosen to come in this package.

00:33:15.588 --> 00:33:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
speaking of packages,

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.960 align:middle line:84%
some people that
are coming through

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and entities that are coming
through are not of this realm.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So there's more hybrid
activity happening now

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.588 align:middle line:84%
than has probably happened since
very, very, very ancient times.

00:33:28.588 --> 00:33:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
you're seeing and experiencing

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.950 align:middle line:84%
with more hybrid entities,
including hybrid people.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: This
last one year, I

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.860 align:middle line:84%
have been seeing
so many clients.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:90%
They'll come online.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be like, right,
I've got a spirit guide here

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:47.030 align:middle line:84%
for you that is not
of a human embodiment.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.850 align:middle line:84%
This person is an
extraterrestrial,

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.260 align:middle line:84%
or this being is an
extraterrestrial.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll move to these
realms and spirits taking me up

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.530 align:middle line:90%
and I'm on another planet.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing the
interactions between the client

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and this guide that
is there for them.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.180 align:middle line:90%
And I'll be telling them this.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And the clients usually
will come back to me saying,

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:12.060 align:middle line:84%
oh my goodness, I have joined
every extraterrestrial group

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:12.860 align:middle line:90%
there is.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I've got
them communicating with you.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.458 align:middle line:90%
They really do.

00:34:17.458 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I don't
logically know a lot about,

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:23.860 align:middle line:84%
but I've been experiencing
it through clients.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:25.532 align:middle line:84%
I'm always quite
naive in my sessions

00:34:25.532 --> 00:34:26.949 align:middle line:84%
with people because
I like to come

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:28.969 align:middle line:84%
from that place
of pure curiosity

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and also learning myself is
when I see these hybrid beings.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.205 align:middle line:84%
You can even see it in
their physical eyes.

00:34:35.205 --> 00:34:36.830 align:middle line:84%
There's something
different about them.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:41.290 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
perspective of the world.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:44.350 align:middle line:84%
They sometimes find it that
they isolate themselves a lot

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
because they're finding
it hard to integrate

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.520 align:middle line:84%
or they're finding it very
difficult to have relationships.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And so these key
telltale signs--

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:56.320 align:middle line:84%
sorry-- that they
are hybrids or they

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:84%
have very few human incarnations
and they're now trying

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.830 align:middle line:90%
to be here going, what do I do?

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But you still have those
beings communicating with you.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I feel extraterrestrials
around me.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.740 align:middle line:90%
They work around me.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know them
familiar enough for myself.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But through people, I've been
taken to different realms

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.780 align:middle line:90%
so much recently.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.472 align:middle line:84%
And when I bring it
up with the client,

00:35:21.472 --> 00:35:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for validating
that I'm not crazy.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I had an alien
abduction when I was eight.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be picking
that up because spirit

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.720 align:middle line:84%
will tell me, tell them
when they were eight,

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.803 align:middle line:84%
they've had something put
into their shoulder that

00:35:33.803 --> 00:35:36.690 align:middle line:84%
is enabling them
to receive guidance

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.440 align:middle line:90%
from these extraterrestrials.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.700 align:middle line:90%
So there are hybrids.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't see too many hybrids.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.800 align:middle line:84%
There's been a handful out of
all of the people I've seen.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:84%
But there are people
that are being

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.280 align:middle line:84%
guided by these
extraterrestrials

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.080 align:middle line:90%
and other beings.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So I feel for the future, there
will be quite a few hybrids.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, this one
woman that I've interviewed

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:90%
a few times, Dr. Linda Backman.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:84%
This is her gig, is
people come to her

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.950 align:middle line:84%
who feel like they're
not really from here.

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be
that the being will

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.290 align:middle line:90%
incarnate into physical form.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So they're bringing
forward the knowledge

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and whatever the directive
is from where they're from.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're keeping
their associations

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.490 align:middle line:84%
with their home people,
with their people who

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.450 align:middle line:90%
continue to guide them as well.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is how you're
experiencing it.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
would feel somewhat lost

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.850 align:middle line:90%
and floundering around here.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Our social structure can
look somewhat chaotic,

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.225 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure, from
another point of view.

00:36:29.225 --> 00:36:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: And I think
what was interesting for me

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:84%
when I started
experiencing these beings,

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:84%
because it's not something
I naturally know about,

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.900 align:middle line:84%
it's they do come in with
a lot of benevolence.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And they come in to help.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To help.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.420 align:middle line:84%
They're almost
always here to help.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: That's right.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.698 align:middle line:84%
And so that for me
was a revelation

00:36:45.698 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know because
I was only communicating mostly

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.580 align:middle line:84%
with human spirits
and the person's soul.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But I just realized, wow, these
beings, they know so much.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.560 align:middle line:84%
They can be everywhere
all at once.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.990 align:middle line:84%
They know what's going
on within the body.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.260 align:middle line:84%
They can test our
blood without even--

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.420 align:middle line:84%
because I can feel
that sometimes.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, here we go.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Someone's taking
my blood right now.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.370 align:middle line:90%
But I know it's not maleficent.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a benevolent thing
to help and help us

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.430 align:middle line:84%
merging these timelines
and upgrade with Earth.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.965 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's an
exciting thing and nothing

00:37:17.965 --> 00:37:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to be afraid of,
especially when you're

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.550 align:middle line:84%
supported by the right people
and you trust in your guides.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:90%
But there is a lot of that.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really glad that
we're talking about this.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA.

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's not talked
about as often.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So again, I keep going back
to this notion of time.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking at this, we
talked a little bit off camera

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.910 align:middle line:84%
because we were going to be
talking about merging timelines

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and that is the notion that
there is for everything that

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:45.980 align:middle line:84%
exists, it exists almost in its
opposite form, positive time,

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:90%
negative time.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.572 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean good
time, bad time, just

00:37:48.572 --> 00:37:50.860 align:middle line:84%
positive and negative,
complementing one another.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Manjir
Samanta-Laughton has

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.130 align:middle line:84%
done a lot of work on these
positive negative timelines,

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.920 align:middle line:84%
which is very interesting
because you've dealt with them,

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.920 align:middle line:84%
is when you say,
but wait a minute.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.580 align:middle line:84%
But if it's already
happened, where's

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.860 align:middle line:90%
my decision making capability?

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
how you interface

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.080 align:middle line:84%
with this notion of reflective
positive-negative time.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: When I time
travel and I'm bringing up

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:20.337 align:middle line:84%
lifetimes with people and
then they're saying to me,

00:38:20.337 --> 00:38:21.462 align:middle line:90%
that's happening to me now.

00:38:21.462 --> 00:38:24.004 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll say to me, I booked
in with you a couple of months

00:38:24.004 --> 00:38:26.700 align:middle line:84%
ago, but what you're bringing
up only happened last week.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So the timing was perfect, and
it was meant to be that way.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:84%
The positive and the negative
in the way that I experience it

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:40.340 align:middle line:84%
is that when people acknowledge
what that pattern is,

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.220 align:middle line:84%
they're able to break
that and change, accept,

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.790 align:middle line:90%
or prepare for something else.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:49.220 align:middle line:84%
But I think when someone is
stuck in the rut of not knowing

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.542 align:middle line:84%
that this is actually
happening in another realm

00:38:51.542 --> 00:38:53.000 align:middle line:84%
or this is happening
in the future,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.540 align:middle line:84%
it's happening in the past,
they seem to think it's a very--

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and I would have to if I didn't
know this work from doing it

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.240 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:84%
It's an isolated
incident, but it's not.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's coming
up for you to make that change.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.130 align:middle line:90%
So when I experience it--

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:middle line:84%
because the souls of
that person that you're

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.668 align:middle line:84%
playing and, say, 1544
turns around and says to me,

00:39:13.668 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:84%
tell her she's
experiencing this now.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:17.010 align:middle line:84%
She's going to
validate that to you.

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And she'll go, that is
what is happening now.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like,
OK, well, we need

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:24.000 align:middle line:84%
to talk to this being
this part of you

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:90%
that you're a fragment of.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Still, this is why you
haven't let her go yet.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So I will quickly get to
what the issue is, and then I

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:84%
can feel the energy
transmuting, and then,

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:34.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, that lessons learned.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So now you've got
to move forward,

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.040 align:middle line:84%
keeping an eye that
you're not going

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.790 align:middle line:90%
to be repeating that anymore.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the element
of free will comes in.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I get triggers too, Regina,
things happen in my own life,

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.737 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, OK, how am I
going to deal with this?

00:39:47.737 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to go back
to the way I was,

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.330 align:middle line:84%
or do I want to go
I've moved past this?

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And I know they come in for
that, and we all get that.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.545 align:middle line:84%
But that's how I know it's when
we're doing things differently,

00:39:56.545 --> 00:39:59.970 align:middle line:84%
that that other
positive-negative lifetime is

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.800 align:middle line:84%
moving aside, and we're
pushing forward from that.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.320 align:middle line:84%
That's the exciting thing
about rewriting these timelines

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.230 align:middle line:90%
to a certain degree.

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:12.750 align:middle line:84%
When the person acknowledges or
is acknowledged and understand,

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:16.440 align:middle line:84%
this is not just
happening to me now.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.530 align:middle line:84%
I had this amazing
situation where--

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and this is again,
the timeline thing,

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.050 align:middle line:90%
a healing between the timelines.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Client came to me.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:25.510 align:middle line:90%
I traveled to a lifetime.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I said to her, you
always have a baby.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:28.433 align:middle line:90%
It's a boy.

00:40:28.433 --> 00:40:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but
the weird thing is

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:32.460 align:middle line:84%
that you're showing me this
baby and he's not breathing.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.330 align:middle line:90%
And the client's looking at me.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, now you're
time traveling me

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:37.660 align:middle line:90%
to a lifetime before that.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, your father
in this lifetime is here.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling me that I gave
birth to a stillborn daughter,

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.300 align:middle line:90%
but she didn't make it.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Then spirit jumps me to the
lifetime where the client is

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.743 align:middle line:90%
showing me her stillborn son.

00:40:51.743 --> 00:40:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is she
the reincarnation

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.840 align:middle line:84%
of the one that didn't make it
in the previous one, the mother?

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: The mother.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: And also what it
was is that two hours later--

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.450 align:middle line:84%
because spirit merges
the timeline for me--

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.350 align:middle line:90%
this baby comes alive.

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.707 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she gives birth
to a stillborn who is--

00:41:07.707 --> 00:41:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Not breathing.

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who's not
breathing for two hours.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: For two hours,

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is
clinically dead.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Clinically dead.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:13.870 align:middle line:90%
And so this is a lifetime.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I can't even remember the
detail of where I was,

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.700 align:middle line:84%
but I remembered the story
because it blew my mind.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But then spirit quickly jumped
me back to a different timeline

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.730 align:middle line:84%
to show the father and then
having stillborn daughter

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:24.690 align:middle line:90%
and what it was.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So I was clearing
the energy of that

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.080 align:middle line:90%
and clearing the energy of this.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, your-- this
son, this boy that you

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:90%
gave birth is a prophet.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:33.430 align:middle line:90%
I said, he's a prophet.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:34.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, he comes alive.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.610 align:middle line:84%
She's bawling her eyes
out in front of me.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:84%
She said, Gaia, she said,
I had a child, I think,

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.040 align:middle line:90%
one or two years ago.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:84%
He was stillborn for two
hours, and he came alive.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.550 align:middle line:90%
And she said, get this.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:48.640 align:middle line:84%
She said, before my dad
met my mom and had me,

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.317 align:middle line:84%
he did have a
stillborn daughter.

00:41:50.317 --> 00:41:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't that wild?

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: And I get
goosebumps telling you.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.060 align:middle line:90%
That's an amazing story.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: It blew my mind.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:42:00.550 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized why spirit
was giving us that information,

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.670 align:middle line:84%
this is what I mean
when some people come

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.800 align:middle line:90%
in as a sacrifice in some ways.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is the term
that spirit gave me.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:10.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like the father in
that previous lifetime

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:13.800 align:middle line:84%
took the grief so for the
future version of his daughter,

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.450 align:middle line:84%
she would get her
beautiful child

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.280 align:middle line:84%
that she can nurture
and love and raise.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And she's actually named
that child a prophet's name.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.960 align:middle line:90%
And so it really blew my mind.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.790 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- but it's amazing
what the level of detail

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.240 align:middle line:90%
that spirit is giving all of us.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.678 align:middle line:90%
We just need to pay attention.

00:42:30.678 --> 00:42:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's beautiful.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:90%
I love that story.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.300 align:middle line:90%
That's profound.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think it touches
everybody's heart to hear that.

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have
virtually no time left.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
you want to pass on

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:43.750 align:middle line:90%
to people before we sign off?

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.320 align:middle line:10%
>>CHINNIAH: I think don't
be afraid of your gifts.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.760 align:middle line:10%
Act now.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.490 align:middle line:10%
Now is the time for you
to really step up and be

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:52.860 align:middle line:10%
who you really are
and start looking

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.530 align:middle line:10%
at life through your
heart, knowing that nothing

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.480 align:middle line:10%
is good or bad,
but everything is

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.850 align:middle line:10%
happening for you,
for your ascension,

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.510 align:middle line:10%
and for your soul progression.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So don't be
afraid to speak up.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Don't be afraid to
step into the things

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.330 align:middle line:84%
you're naturally inclined
to do and your heart really

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:08.260 align:middle line:90%
wants to do.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: That's right.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.057 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now's
the time to do it.

00:43:10.057 --> 00:43:12.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a lot of time
to waste this time around,

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:14.380 align:middle line:90%
even though time doesn't exist.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.755 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: That's
exactly right.

00:43:15.755 --> 00:43:17.172 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gaia,
thank you so much.

00:43:17.172 --> 00:43:18.890 align:middle line:84%
It's been really fun
talking with you.

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:19.700 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Thank
you for having me.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.622 align:middle line:10%
