00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.077 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JON GABRIEL: Did that
whole binge, starve thing.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'd lose five pounds, gain
10 pounds, lose five pounds,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.860 align:middle line:84%
gain 10 pounds, until I
gained over 200 pounds.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Had this kind of thought that
came into my head that said,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.240 align:middle line:90%
your body wants to be fat.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And as long as it
wants to be fat,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing you
can do to stop it.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.980 align:middle line:90%
I started healing my microbiome.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I started nourishing my body
by adding healthier foods,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.850 align:middle line:84%
healing my trauma, and I
did a lot of visualization.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
What I became aware
of in that space

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:84%
is that there's not
just this universe.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a nearly infinite number
of variations of this universe.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm talking to her,
I'm working on this blockage,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.335 align:middle line:90%
and it opened.

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like the timeline was
kind of going like this.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Interesting.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.877 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And her
past was changing.

00:00:49.877 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when we
think that the problems are

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
too big for us, whether it's
the war, or pandemic, whatever

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.128 align:middle line:84%
it is, that can be changed
too because there's

00:00:57.128 --> 00:00:59.670 align:middle line:84%
a version of reality where that
doesn't exist to that extent.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.440 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
move to a version--

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To the other--

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.745 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: To the
version of reality--

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --timeline.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.038 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: --where
it's happening better.

00:01:05.038 --> 00:01:08.913 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.913 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How many of you
have dealt with the desire

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:10%
to have your body in better
condition or lighter,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:10%
but you can't pull it together?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine a
situation in which

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:84%
you use your mind, not diets,
to reshape your physical body?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:10%
Jon Gabriel did and
lost over 200 pounds.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:10%
But it isn't the
weight that we're

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.473 align:middle line:10%
going to have this
conversation about.

00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:90%
That's only a part of it.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
power of your mind.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And the power it
has over matter.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jon.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Thanks, Regina.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Here you
are so slim and fit.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to imagine
you hit 410 pounds.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.400 align:middle line:90%
But we have some pictures.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, wow.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
you were dieting.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, sometimes people say, when
they're in an obese state say,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.510 align:middle line:10%
oh, I'm dieting.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
But they're secretly
eating or other things.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, well--

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What were you--

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.875 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I think everybody
that's dieting is secretly

00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:90%
eating, first of all.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that's true
because you're now

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:90%
in a deprivation mode.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Exactly, yeah.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.328 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've
got to trick yourself

00:02:04.328 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:90%
and sneak things and all that.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
What were you actually doing
when you got up to 410 pounds?

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:10%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, well, I moved
to New York back in the '90s.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:10%
And I just started--

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.058 align:middle line:10%
I was working on Wall Street.

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:17.718 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I started
working there, high-stress job,

00:02:17.718 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I started gaining weight.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think too much about
it the first couple of years.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.867 align:middle line:10%
But after two years, three
years, I gained 50, 60 pounds.

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:10%
I thought, OK, I'm going
to do something about it.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'll go on a diet.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up
trying pretty much

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:90%
every diet you can imagine.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, I
did the low calorie.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.308 align:middle line:84%
That's like the
first thing you do.

00:02:35.308 --> 00:02:37.222 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that
works for a short time.

00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And like you say, but then
your body goes into this--

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Body adjusts.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: --scarcity mode.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, hey,
this doesn't feel right.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't feel safe.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:90%
This isn't what I want.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
this big binge.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I did that whole
binge starve thing--

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.770 align:middle line:84%
two weeks dieting, one
big binge, like this.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:90%
And then I kept gaining.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Like maybe I'd lose five
pounds, gain 10 pounds,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:84%
lose five pounds, gain 10 pounds
until I gained over 200 pounds.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I say I
tried everything,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I worked face to face
with the late Dr. Atkins

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:90%
from the Atkins diet.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you weren't having
Snickers bars on the side?

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: I was.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is I
was trying not to.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
trying not to, yeah.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I was
doing the thing.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is
maybe three or four days

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.825 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't doing that.

00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But in the fourth
day, I'm exhausted.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm stressed out.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You want some sugar.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Screw it.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And boom, and then we'd
have that huge binge.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:90%
So that was part and parcel.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.478 align:middle line:84%
I think dieting and
bingeing, to me,

00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:90%
are two sides of the same coin.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: And it wasn't until--

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:84%
pretty much it was at 2001,
I had this kind of thought

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:90%
that came into my head.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It was like this
voice that said,

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:90%
your body wants to be fat.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And as long as it
wants to be fat,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing you
can do to stop it.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.275 align:middle line:90%
And even now as I say this--

00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Goosebumps.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: --20-plus
years, I get goosebumps.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, OK, now you have
to deconstruct that for us.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, I'm happy to.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As they
say now, unpack it.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.747 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah,
so let's do that.

00:03:59.747 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's unpack because what
happened at that point

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
is that I stopped dieting
because I realized

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.763 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't addressing the issue.

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And I started
asking the question,

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:90%
why does my body want to be fat?

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And that led me on an approach
that not only healed me,

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:84%
but then I wrote the book "The
Gabriel Method" which really

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.498 align:middle line:84%
is about hey, these
are the reasons why

00:04:18.498 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:90%
your body would want to be fat.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what did
your body tell you?

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Why did you want to be fat?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So what
happens is your body gets

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
certain hormonal signals that it
confuses, for example, stress.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.548 align:middle line:84%
And I was living in
a very high stress--

00:04:32.548 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On Wall Street.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
It will cause certain
hormonal signals to your body

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.767 align:middle line:84%
that it will confuse as
like a famine, for example.

00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Because when we were living out
in the wild thousands of years

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:84%
ago, there was only
two types of stress.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
There was immediate
acute stress,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
like you got to run away
or you're going to die.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.763 align:middle line:84%
Or there was a
chronic low-grade--

00:04:52.763 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like famine.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: --that's the only
one thousands of years ago.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies are
hardwired to interpret

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:84%
chronic low-grade
stress, not acute stress,

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:84%
but chronic low-grade
stress as a famine.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:90%
So today--

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your
life on Wall Street--

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Was chronic
low-grade stress.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.792 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The stress of
day-to-day transactions

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:90%
was chronic low-grade stress.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Chronic
low-grade, nonstop.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.918 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And oftentimes,
people will use food.

00:05:12.918 --> 00:05:16.242 align:middle line:84%
They'll use drugs, whether
it's cocaine or whatever--

00:05:16.242 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: To turn to--

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Wolf on Wall
Street," all of the above.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:90%
To turn those signals off.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.287 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sex.

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.087 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:22.087 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: But what
the main signal that

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
is for certain people
and for me in particular

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
is your body actually
thinks it's a famine.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is if
you're in a real famine,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
once you start eating, you're
not in a famine anymore.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:90%
So your body's like, I'm good.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:84%
But if your body's
getting that famine signal

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's not coming
from food, then it

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.238 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter how much you eat.

00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:84%
It's still getting
the famine signal.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's how you end up--

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the stress
continues even though the food

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:90%
supply is there.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: The hormonal
signal is the message

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:90%
is chronic low-grade stress.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Chronic low-grade stress,
chronic low-grade inflammation

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.107 align:middle line:84%
are the two things that cause
your body to gain weight.

00:05:55.107 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And those are the things
that you have to address.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.825 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was there anything
deeper psychologically?

00:05:58.825 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.805 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what else was
saying I want to be fat?

00:06:01.805 --> 00:06:03.788 align:middle line:90%
Your body wants to be fat?

00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So a lot of
people have trauma issues.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.868 align:middle line:84%
And it actually makes them
feel safer in a bigger body.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To be buffered.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked with
people years now.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wrote the book I
don't know 15, 20 years ago.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:90%
But I talked to people.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And I remember talking
to this one lady.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And she was with her
sister at a store.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:90%
And some handsome guy walked in.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And she thought the guy
was looking at her sister.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.263 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, oh, I'm safe.

00:06:31.263 --> 00:06:33.430 align:middle line:84%
He won't look at me because
I have the extra weight.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm safe.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And I thought and I
said to her, as long

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.725 align:middle line:84%
as you have that feeling, like
that's what's keeping you safe,

00:06:40.725 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
there's no way your body's
going to let go of the weight.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.017 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of women who
especially if they've

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
been through a violent situation
or sexual abuse in particular,

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:84%
this can very easily
become a default

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.107 align:middle line:90%
pattern to buffer yourself.

00:06:56.107 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And for me,
that wasn't my issue.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But I did live through abuse,
physical abuse, growing up.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And I felt safer being bigger.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And I did have a
business partner

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
when I was working
on Wall Street who

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:90%
was a very aggressive guy.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And there was a part of
me that the child inside

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:90%
was actually afraid of him.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, sure.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.805 align:middle line:84%
So you got a lot of
buffer going there.

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: At a certain
point, I was twice his weight.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.412 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I
could sit on him.

00:07:22.412 --> 00:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did that help
you feel more powerful?

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: It did.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It helped me feel
safer in the situation

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
because his communication
style was very aggressive.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And growing up, that type
of aggressive communication

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:84%
usually led to a
physical confrontation.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, we never had a
physical confrontation.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:84%
But my body always
felt like, OK, I'm

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:84%
not safe in this situation
until I was twice his size.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I was twice his size,
I thought, he can't touch me.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.428 align:middle line:90%
I could just sit on him

00:07:48.428 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
that interesting?

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So because a lot of
women are watching

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
this and a lot of women
who relate and have

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.840 align:middle line:84%
been through this, and even if
they don't know yet consciously

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
that this is a safety issue
more than anything else--

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:84%
but also what about
the woman who, man

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.500 align:middle line:90%
or woman, who are the nurturers?

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.980 align:middle line:84%
For example, health care
professionals, nurses,

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes end up
bringing a lot of treats

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:84%
to work to soothe themselves
and be friends with one another

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and pick up a fair amount of
weight in that profession.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.812 align:middle line:90%
That seems to be pretty common.

00:08:22.812 --> 00:08:24.562 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Well, there's
a lot of reasons.

00:08:24.562 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
One of them, they could
have that trauma also.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.092 align:middle line:84%
But the other is
it's a way of giving

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:84%
yourself love if
you're not getting

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:90%
enough love or enough fun.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're giving
all your energy away.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.497 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah,
if you're depleted

00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
or if you're not having
enough fun in your life.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:84%
You're not having enough
love, enough connection,

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:90%
food can fill that void also.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's really common.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's not
so much a safety one.

00:08:43.865 --> 00:08:46.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a lack of affection,
love, or whatever

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:90%
it is that gives you joy.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Exactly.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.355 align:middle line:84%
It's another form
of nourishment.

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Food is nourishment, right?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.690 align:middle line:90%
So is love.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:90%
So is friendship.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:90%
So is connection.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where
did your understanding

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:90%
of how to bust this come in?

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going
to start talking

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:84%
about parallel realities
and such that are--

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:90%
where you are now in your life.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, you were
actually using these principles

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and maybe didn't understand them
as completely as you do now.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: No I didn't,
not until it was 2006.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And we can get to that.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what
happened up till then

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:84%
when you started
losing the weight

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.217 align:middle line:90%
with this whole internal aspect.

00:09:23.217 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: As soon as
I made the realization

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle line:84%
that I have to figure out
what's causing my weight,

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I quickly realized that there
was a lot of emotional trauma

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:84%
that I had to deal with,
which I did deal with.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I understood that also I wasn't
nourishing my body well enough

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's another thing that
can cause you to-- because no

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.580 align:middle line:84%
matter how much you're
eating, if you're not getting

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:90%
the nourishment you need--

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No real nutrients.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: It's like
a nutritional famine.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: You're
getting all the calories,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:84%
but you're not
getting the nutrients.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.542 align:middle line:84%
And if your stomach isn't
able to digest it also

00:09:50.542 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:84%
because you have
microbiome issues,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:84%
so I started healing
my microbiome.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I started nourishing my body
by adding healthier foods,

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:90%
healing my trauma.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And I did a lot
of visualization.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And visualization
was something that I

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:90%
learned as a 10-year-old.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:84%
My father taught me
visualization when I was 10.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I had horrible migraine
headaches every single night.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.113 align:middle line:90%
Nothing would work.

00:10:11.113 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Aspirin wouldn't work.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I would sit in a dark room for
hours and just like be in pain.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.633 align:middle line:90%
And he was a dentist.

00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And he used visualization
to help people

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:90%
with pain in his profession.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:90%
And so he sat me down.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.902 align:middle line:90%
He calmed my body.

00:10:22.902 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want you to
imagine that we're skiing down

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.943 align:middle line:84%
this slope-- we used
to go skiing together--

00:10:26.943 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and there's this bucket of
black sand on your shoulder.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And as you're skiing down,
you're tilting the black sand,

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.868 align:middle line:84%
and it's falling away
as you're skiing.

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And that black sand
is your headache.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:90%
And we got halfway down.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.563 align:middle line:84%
And now the headache's
halfway down, halfway gone.

00:10:40.563 --> 00:10:41.363 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:10:41.363 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
We got down to the bottom,
and the headache was gone.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a beautiful gift.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.073 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he gave me it.

00:10:46.073 --> 00:10:48.265 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, it was
the only thing that worked.

00:10:48.265 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned
how to do it myself,

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.337 align:middle line:90%
this whole visualization.

00:10:51.337 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
I could do things

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.870 align:middle line:84%
like I just visualize--
like usually when

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:84%
you have a migraine headache,
it's on one side or the other.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So say if it's on this side,
I would visualize the headache

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:84%
just going into my finger
and flicking it away.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.473 align:middle line:90%
And it would go.

00:11:04.473 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And I never had migraine
headaches after that.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you'd
already learned

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:84%
how to work with the
mind as a youngin.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.857 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:09.857 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:90%
And I did it to stop smoking.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.932 align:middle line:84%
When I was 14, I
visualized that--

00:11:15.932 --> 00:11:18.390 align:middle line:84%
you know the tar in the street
that's really repulsive when

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:90%
they're--

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.778 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So I visualized that
the cigarette was that tar.

00:11:21.778 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And I would visualize
tasting it and so like

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:84%
being repulsed by
it-- so creating

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:84%
this negative association
with visualization.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:90%
And that worked really well.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I've used visualization
in many different things.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I started using visualization
to create my perfect ideal body.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:84%
As I was going to
sleep at night,

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I visualized having
stomach muscles

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and being in shape again because
I was an athlete in school.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I was a ski racer
and a triathlete.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.545 align:middle line:90%
And I was in great shape.

00:11:48.545 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So every night as I
was going to sleep,

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd visualized my ideal body--
stomach muscles, tight skin.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I visualized running on
the beach and sprinting.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I visualized eating
healthy foods.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I visualized my body
wanting to be thin.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I also visualized
feeling safe, like having

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:84%
a safety barrier of energy
around me, feeling protected.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I did
that, everything changed.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Not only everything changed
in terms of my weight.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:90%
I started losing weight.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Everything changed in my life.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.368 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as I did that,
that was right after 2001--

00:12:20.368 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
still large at this point.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: I was large.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:90%
I was 400 pounds.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I started doing
this visualization.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Two weeks later, 9/11 happened.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of changed my
life because I was almost

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.995 align:middle line:90%
on one of those planes.

00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:38.085 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to fly from
Newark to San Francisco.

00:12:38.085 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:84%
If I booked the flight, I would
have booked the United Airlines

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.583 align:middle line:84%
flight that's nonstop in the
morning, United Airlines flight

00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:84%
93 which is one
of the ones that--

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: But my
partner booked the flight

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:90%
because I was away at a retreat.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And he found a cheaper
flight connecting out

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:90%
of San Francisco.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, connecting
out of Cincinnati.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:84%
I was actually really
mad at him for that.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:90%
We saved $150.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I bet you weren't
a few hours later.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: I wasn't.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, eventually, I wasn't.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he saved my life.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:84%
But that had a real
impact on me because--

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did you feel
the message was to you there?

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I felt like life
gave me a second chance.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I felt like here I
was killing myself,

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:90%
doing something I didn't like.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you would
have made a decision that

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.988 align:middle line:90%
would have finished it.

00:13:18.988 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And I
would have died.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:90%
I was already killing myself.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.580 align:middle line:90%
I was 400 pounds.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I was living a miserable life.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, life just
gave me a second chance.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much
longer I'll be around.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
But I want to start
living my life now

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:84%
for now, like living exactly
the way I want to live now.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you started
these visualizations.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And what are the first things--
because your body still

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:90%
looked the same.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.927 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in your mind,
you had the body you have now.

00:13:44.927 --> 00:13:45.862 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:13:45.862 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
some real anomalies about

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:90%
that, you would say.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Like your skin doesn't sag.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It didn't sag.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Your skin came back as though
you were never overweight,

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.193 align:middle line:90%
which is very unusual.

00:13:56.193 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the first things

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:84%
you started noticing
when you dropped

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:84%
into this parallel
reality of potential

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:90%
that you were creating.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So the first
thing is I wasn't as hungry.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I just wasn't as hungry.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't craving the junk food.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't thinking about food.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:90%
I had more energy.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered I had
really big sleep problems.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's a huge issue.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:90%
So if you have--

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
usually, overweight people,
when they're heavy enough,

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:90%
they have sleep apnea.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And then they never get
into a deep enough sleep.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And that causes a
hormonal problem

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
that causes you to gain weight
and have junk food cravings.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:90%
I keyed in on that.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:90%
And I got that taken care of.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
then 9/11 happened.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:90%
And I left New York.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:84%
This is like within
a couple of weeks.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.275 align:middle line:90%
I left my company.

00:14:42.275 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:90%
We sold our company.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I moved to Western Australia,
literally as far away

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:90%
as you can get.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.002 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why in the
world did you do that?

00:14:50.002 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, so my wife
at the time, her best friend

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.320 align:middle line:84%
moved out there because she
had married an Australian.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And he had bought a farm
in a place called Denmark.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Western Australia's the most
beautiful place in the world--

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:84%
all the way down south
in Western Australia,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:84%
completely remote, but on the
southern ocean, cleanest air,

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
cleanest-- old world
trees, gorgeous trees.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Real estate was really cheap
and all this kind of stuff.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
get out of New York.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to get
as far away from it.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to be in nature.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.520 align:middle line:90%
I really missed nature.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.408 align:middle line:90%
And she liked it.

00:15:20.408 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:90%
She wanted to move there.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:90%
And so I bought a house there.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:90%
And we moved out there.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
now, I went from working

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:84%
on Wall Street, where I never
saw the sun in the wintertime--

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.902 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: --eating
junk food all the time,

00:15:31.902 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:84%
400 pounds, to being
in the situation where

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this beautiful place
in nature, beach and trees,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
meditating like three
hours a day, visualizing.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It radically
changed life.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.255 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Praying all day.

00:15:44.255 --> 00:15:46.352 align:middle line:84%
And the weight's
melting off of me.

00:15:46.352 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I
wrote the book is

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:84%
that when the weight
was melting off of me,

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't making an effort
to restrict myself.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I would make an effort to eat
healthy, to add healthy things.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But if I wanted McDonald's
or if I wanted cupcakes

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.898 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was,
I would eat it.

00:16:01.898 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:84%
But the weight was
still melting off of me.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And so now I'm in this situation
where before there was nothing

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.855 align:middle line:90%
I could do to lose weight.

00:16:10.855 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Now there's nothing I can
do to keep the weight on.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.897 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to keep the
weight on, I couldn't.

00:16:14.897 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:90%
It was just melting off of me.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
in this lifestyle,

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.478 align:middle line:84%
that whole famine
low-grade stress was gone.

00:16:20.478 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Everything was gone.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Everything that was causing--

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I was no longer in a place
that I hated, no longer doing

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:84%
what I hated, no longer in
a confrontative situation

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:90%
with a business partner.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I was in a supportive,
loving place.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:90%
We bought a house.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.040 align:middle line:90%
And we were living very simply.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:84%
My expenses were
next to nothing.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.893 align:middle line:90%
I had fruit trees.

00:16:39.893 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It sounds idyllic.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.908 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: You know it
was really idyllic--

00:16:43.908 --> 00:16:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and the weight was melting off.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And after two years,
all of it had gone--

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:90%
all of it.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I had the exact body that I
visualized with the stomach

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.227 align:middle line:84%
muscles, with the
tight skin, all of it.

00:16:53.227 --> 00:16:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, tight skin.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:10%
>>GABRIEL: And then
that's why I come like--

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.097 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And we have
pictures so people

00:16:57.097 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:10%
can see because there
are people who've said,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:10%
oh, no, it's
photoshopped, right?

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:10%
No, and you had a person that
took the original photo who

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:10%
said, this is not photoshopped.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:90%
I saw that on your site.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.482 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, I had
to do that because I

00:17:08.482 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:90%
was getting so much of that.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
most people do not

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:84%
understand how
much mind permeates

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.119 align:middle line:84%
our cellular structure
and can alter it.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah,
I even had someone

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.110 align:middle line:84%
say that I photoshopped the
before, like I was never

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%
really fat.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:22.609 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I don't know
what to say to that.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I can't help it.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:24.967 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was.

00:17:24.967 --> 00:17:25.849 align:middle line:90%
Ask my former wife.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So now this is
melting off of you.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:90%
You're in Australia.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
You're leading a very
stress-free life.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And now you're starting
also to discover

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:84%
things I think about the nature
of reality, the nature of time,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.120 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about 2006 forward
in that part of the journey.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.133 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, so one of the
things that happened to me just

00:17:46.133 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:84%
going back to the very
end of my weight loss--

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:84%
so I had lost probably 175
pounds, something like that.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.493 align:middle line:84%
And it came to me really
strongly to do a detox.

00:17:55.493 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:90%
My friend had just done one.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.603 align:middle line:84%
He mentioned an expert Dr. Joel
Fuhrman I think his name is.

00:18:00.603 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, Fuhrman.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I remember that.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And so
I read his book

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.512 align:middle line:84%
"Fasting and Eating for
Health" or something like that.

00:18:06.512 --> 00:18:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And he had gone like
42 days on just water.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.313 align:middle line:90%
It was just like crazy.

00:18:10.313 --> 00:18:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had no intention of
doing something like that.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.260 align:middle line:90%
But I wanted to do a detox.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I went out
for a bike ride.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm biking up a hill.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And I feel this like slashing
feeling right here in my liver.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like
someone put a knife.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And I hear this woman's
voice and it says,

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.930 align:middle line:90%
your liver needs cleansing.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Go on a detox.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So I come home and I think,
well, just maybe I'll

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:90%
miss lunch or something.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.100 align:middle line:90%
I get home.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And right before I went,
I had hung these pictures

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
up of meditation
masters that I follow.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.062 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not livers.

00:18:47.062 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Nothing like that.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But one of them
is Anandamayi Ma,

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:84%
which is a beautiful Indian
saint who lived 100 years ago.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt
connected to her.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So I hung up this picture
before I went biking.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:84%
When I came home, the
picture had fallen.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:90%
It had a glass frame.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And the glass had
broken and the picture

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:90%
was cut in the exact spot--

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.728 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:19:08.728 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: --that I had--

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a pretty
mystical experience.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And what I felt like
is someone hit me over the head

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:84%
with a mystical baseball
bat is what it felt like.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I went into another
world for 21 days.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:90%
And I did a 21-day water fast.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.470 align:middle line:90%
I was not hungry.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.750 align:middle line:90%
I never thought about food.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.108 align:middle line:90%
It's like I thought--

00:19:28.108 --> 00:19:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you were almost
in an alternate reality though.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: I went--

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about where you went here.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: I thought
I was dead actually.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.027 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you why--
because I read a lot.

00:19:38.027 --> 00:19:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I used to read a lot
of stories about people

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:90%
that do astral travel.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was like
the Magus of Strovolos,

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:90%
it was his name.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:90%
He was a Cyprus man.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And people that do astral
travel, the first thing

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:90%
that they all talk about it.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
each other, so there

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.100 align:middle line:90%
must be something to it.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.950 align:middle line:84%
They talk about how when
they do astral travel,

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.390 align:middle line:84%
their guides come
and they say, hey,

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:84%
we need you to help us take
somebody and transition them

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:03.890 align:middle line:90%
to the light.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:90%
They don't know they're dead.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.223 align:middle line:84%
And they can't see people,
but they can see you.

00:20:08.223 --> 00:20:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And they can't see us.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.348 align:middle line:90%
They're like an intermediary.

00:20:10.348 --> 00:20:12.065 align:middle line:84%
So they go up to the
person and they go,

00:20:12.065 --> 00:20:13.815 align:middle line:84%
you notice you haven't
eaten much recently

00:20:13.815 --> 00:20:15.988 align:middle line:84%
and you notice you haven't
gone to the bathroom.

00:20:15.988 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, I noticed that.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you kind of gently
ease them into the idea

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.295 align:middle line:90%
that they're dead.

00:20:20.295 --> 00:20:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The reason.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.925 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And then they
take them up into the light.

00:20:22.925 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like, I haven't
eaten maybe 10 days.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Halfway through it I'm like,
I've been on water for 10 days.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.052 align:middle line:90%
I'm not hungry.

00:20:33.052 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting on a bench.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm waiting for somebody to
come and say, have you noticed--

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Am I dead?

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.112 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't very much
in an altered state.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.645 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I had
lost all the weight.

00:20:43.645 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's just when-- and
my father had just died,

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:90%
so I went to New York and--

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were people
shocked when they saw you?

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, they were.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I can't
imagine the homecoming

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:90%
after losing 200 pounds.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, I know.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.067 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- as
a matter of fact,

00:20:57.067 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:84%
his best friend, the
first person I saw

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:90%
walked right by me.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:90%
He didn't recognize me.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, sure.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:84%
But for one reason,
I went up to New York

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and I went to my
friend Khaliah Ali.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
She's the daughter
of Muhammad Ali.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:84%
She was being honored
by this guy Sri Chinmoy

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.567 align:middle line:84%
who, at the time,
I don't know who--

00:21:17.567 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:84%
he used to do this thing which
was a visualization thing where

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:84%
he would lift people
up on a platform.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And he'd do it
with visualization.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:90%
And I went up to support her.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And he saw my
picture and he said,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
this was a spiritual
transformation.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And then
he gave me this--

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:84%
it's like it's an
honor that he does

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
where he lifts me up, puts me
on a platform, and lifts me up.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt like I had made
an upgrade in my reality.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm now living in a place
that's just absolutely gorgeous.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing what I want to do.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I have the body
I wanted to have.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And spiritually, there's a very
different feeling in my body.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.707 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happened-- I know
this is a little tangential,

00:21:55.707 --> 00:21:57.290 align:middle line:84%
but people will
probably be wondering.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
your relationship?

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:90%
You became a different person.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, it ended.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:84%
My wife was no longer
interested in me.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
She actually said, I'm not
attracted to you anymore

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:90%
after I lost the weight.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
whatever the totality--

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: She said--

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -- made you support
yourself and protect yourself

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.853 align:middle line:84%
as a heavy man wasn't
the one she loved.

00:22:14.853 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: She says, like
you're a different person.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.237 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And I was
a different person.

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:20.330 align:middle line:90%
And that was sad.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.130 align:middle line:90%
And I was sad.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:22.480 align:middle line:90%
And that was tough.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.980 align:middle line:84%
But it was a
blessing in disguise

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
because it let me be
that different person

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and not be that different
person while trying

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.403 align:middle line:84%
to be the other person
at the same time.

00:22:30.403 --> 00:22:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's important.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I wanted you to say
that because others are

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:90%
going through the same thing.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.153 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Well, I've had like--

00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
leaving my job on Wall Street,
that was a huge transition.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.790 align:middle line:90%
And I became another person.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And then when that ended,
that was another person.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:10%
But that let me go
out in the world.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:10%
And after that, I
spent years traveling

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.233 align:middle line:10%
around doing events,
and seminars,

00:22:49.233 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:10%
and lectures, and working
with people, and coaching,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:10%
and writing, and
all those things

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:10%
I don't think I could have
done in that framework.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Very true.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:58.790 align:middle line:90%
So now let's go into--

00:22:58.790 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: 2006.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, 2006.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.285 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So 2006, I did
another 21-day water fast.

00:23:04.285 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:90%
I had already lost the weight.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:90%
And I was just inspired.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember the
exact details of it,

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.440 align:middle line:84%
but I just felt
like-- at least I

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:90%
was going to do water fasting.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.840 align:middle line:90%
It just kind of kept going.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And that turned out to
be a really powerful

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:84%
spiritual experience
where I felt like a higher

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.643 align:middle line:84%
consciousness was--
at the end of it,

00:23:23.643 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I felt like a
higher consciousness

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:90%
was living in my body.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And the only way I can describe
it is, from what I've read,

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:84%
is what people call a
cosmic consciousness

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.780 align:middle line:84%
where you have this awareness
like you're aware of everything

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.300 align:middle line:90%
that's happening all at once.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
that, I'm not aware

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.490 align:middle line:84%
of every single conversation
that's going to unfold

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But the same way you're
aware of your body,

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:90%
like I know where my--

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.195 align:middle line:84%
I know what's going on with my
knees right now and my shins.

00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:47.320 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of everything.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:84%
You're not aware of every cell
or every electronic connection.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.935 align:middle line:90%
But you're aware of your body.

00:23:50.935 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I had this idea that
I was everything.

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.810 align:middle line:90%
I was you.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:90%
You were me.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:01.092 align:middle line:84%
But we're all what Tim calls
a seventh consciousness

00:24:01.092 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So I lived in that
space for a few days.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And what I became
aware of in that space

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:84%
is that there's not
just this universe.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:84%
There's an infinite,
nearly infinite number

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:90%
of variations of this universe.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And this was in back
in 2006 where maybe you

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:84%
heard about the idea
of alternate universes

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.030 align:middle line:90%
or parallel realities.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't like it
is now where Marvel

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.695 align:middle line:84%
is going Doctor Strange
in the multiverse

00:24:26.695 --> 00:24:28.737 align:middle line:84%
and this in the multiverse
where it's really kind

00:24:28.737 --> 00:24:30.140 align:middle line:90%
of like become very mainstream.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't
in my consciousness

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:90%
to think about that.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But when I was in that
super-conscious state,

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wait a second, this
is just one version of reality.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.767 align:middle line:84%
There are infinite number
of parallel universes.

00:24:41.767 --> 00:24:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's really what
broke you free to continue on

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.400 align:middle line:90%
to do what you're doing today.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Exactly.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I actually had experience
where I was talking to someone

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and I could see them moving
from one version of reality,

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:54.680 align:middle line:90%
one timeline to the other.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:90%
So I'm talking to them.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:90%
We were just in a store.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.408 align:middle line:90%
It's a small town.

00:24:58.408 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:90%
You know everybody there.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.992 align:middle line:84%
And so I ran into someone, and
she was upset about something.

00:25:01.992 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And as we're talking,
I could see her energy

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:90%
moving through her body.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
It was like white and yellow
kind of energy moving.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And there was a blockage,
like I see a blockage

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:90%
like right in this area.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.792 align:middle line:84%
And she was talking
about some problems

00:25:16.792 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that she was having
in her life how

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
she wanted certain things to be
a bit different than they were.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that the
blockage was the problem.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.200 align:middle line:84%
The blockage was keeping her
in a lower vibrational place.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm talking to her,
I'm working on this blockage

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and it opened.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And I could see her
energy shifting.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm working on
it, what I'm seeing

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
is this weird thing
where she's moving--

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.453 align:middle line:84%
she's got a different future
but a different past, too.

00:25:44.453 --> 00:25:46.120 align:middle line:84%
I could see-- it was
like a timeline was

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:46.780 align:middle line:90%
kind of going like this.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:47.697 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:25:47.697 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And her
past was changing.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Not hugely, like she had
sick parents or whatever,

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:53.470 align:middle line:90%
but there was differences.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would be because
if she's made that transition,

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:84%
that means there might have
been other supporting--

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Exactly.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --changes in the past
that had made that decision.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And then finally
the blockage opens up.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:90%
She has this huge cry.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
the conversation.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.780 align:middle line:10%
I don't have any idea
what we're talking about.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But it was like
maybe to her I said

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:90%
something that was meaningful.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:90%
She's hugging me.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:90%
She's crying.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.960 align:middle line:84%
It was right there
in the grocery store.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
that she had moved.

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the blockage
opened up, it

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.720 align:middle line:84%
allowed her vibration
or energy, the amount

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:84%
of energy she's channeling
to go into a higher state.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And she was allowed
to exist in the state

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that she wanted to in the
reality she wanted to,

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.840 align:middle line:84%
in the version of reality
that she wanted to

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:84%
because her energy was
complementary to that.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a higher
vibrational reality.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to live in
that because she had a higher

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:84%
vibration going through her
because the blockage had opened

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:90%
And I watched the whole thing.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And then she moved
into this other reality

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:84%
where she was in a
better situation.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.322 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
wonderful story.

00:26:46.322 --> 00:26:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, so that
lasted for a few days.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And then when it went,
I felt like I was just

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:84%
plunged down to the
depths of hell overnight.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:90%
It was really-- it was tough.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It was a tough
transition to come back

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:90%
to where I was from there.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From that moment.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Because I thought I
would always be in this place.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And when you're in
that place, you have no stress.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:90%
You have no fear.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:90%
You have no--

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, right.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: And so I went--

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.638 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So back to reality.

00:27:08.638 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, it
was back to reality.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But that lasted for me
because I knew from that point

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that we are living in a zillion
different versions of reality.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:90%
We're living in a multiverse.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
There's infinite number
of parallel realities

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and that what determines
what reality, that's

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:25.940 align:middle line:90%
a number of things that do it.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But one of the biggest
ones is what your energy

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.430 align:middle line:84%
is, how much energy
you're able to channel,

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and mostly how open your
energy channels are.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if your energy
channels are not open enough,

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:84%
you can't channel the energies,
the higher energies that

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:84%
will allow you to exist in the
higher dimensional versions

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:44.250 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So I spent from then,
since 2006 till now,

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I have meditation that I
do for several hours a day

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:84%
actually where I'm opening
my energy channels.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I'm doing.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.937 align:middle line:84%
And once my energy
channels are open,

00:27:56.937 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that's when I ask my higher
self and the higher energies

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:84%
to come through and lead me to
the highest version of reality.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.518 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of like
my ritual every day.

00:28:04.518 --> 00:28:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's your practice.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what I'm seeing is
when we incarnate, we come in

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:90%
and we're a package.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:90%
And we have--

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I almost see it like
the rays of the sun, all

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.340 align:middle line:84%
of these potential parallel
realities and timelines.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the stimuli
in our lives in that moment,

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.720 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
choices we make,

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
we're going to hop onto
any one of those paths.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And we can hop off of
it and onto another one.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.008 align:middle line:90%
We're not stuck there.

00:28:36.008 --> 00:28:37.175 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: That's the thing.

00:28:37.175 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even I did
an interview recently

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Tara Swart on the
subject of neuroplasticity

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.610 align:middle line:84%
that goes well with this whole
notion of parallel realities.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:90%
You make a decision.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Your whole support structure
of greater mind and brain

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:84%
will rewire itself to
support the new reality

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:90%
and timeline you've jumped on.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's my little
circular view of it.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Explain it to us the way
you would explain it.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yes, so the
first thing you have to do

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.560 align:middle line:90%
is look at a timeline.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So you look at a timeline,
the whole timeline from start

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:90%
to finish is already created.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like we made
a movie outside.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And then in that
timeline, you can go fast.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:13.950 align:middle line:90%
You can go forward.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:14.510 align:middle line:90%
You can backwards.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:90%
You can go slow.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:15.710 align:middle line:90%
You can go fast.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.252 align:middle line:84%
You can watch it
over and over again.

00:29:17.252 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
in a timeline, if we

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:84%
were to stay in
that timeline, we're

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.825 align:middle line:84%
going to do exactly
what it's going to be.

00:29:24.825 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:90%
It's never going to change.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.555 align:middle line:84%
But what we don't realize is
there's an infinite variation.

00:29:28.555 --> 00:29:30.680 align:middle line:84%
You pick up that cup or
you don't pick up that cup.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.390 align:middle line:84%
That's two slightly
different variations.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.640 align:middle line:84%
You decide tomorrow
to run for president,

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.750 align:middle line:90%
that's another variation.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a bigger variation
because it doesn't just change

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:90%
how much water you're getting.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.150 align:middle line:90%
It could change the whole world.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's different things that
happen, but they're all there.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And what we don't realize
is our consciousness

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and our nonphysical
energy is moving

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.492 align:middle line:84%
seamlessly, moment by moment,
from one version of reality.

00:29:51.492 --> 00:29:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Between potentials.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
all about potentials.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Because when we think
of parallel universes--

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:84%
we watch I think the
first movie in the '90s,

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Jet Li had a movie,
"The Kung Fu Master,"

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:07.490 align:middle line:84%
where he was going from
a parallel universe

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:84%
to parallel universe killing
all his versions of himself

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.560 align:middle line:90%
because he'd take the power.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.435 align:middle line:90%
So you have to have a portal.

00:30:15.435 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.810 align:middle line:90%
There's got to be an opening.

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:84%
That's not the case
for nonphysical energy.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.915 align:middle line:84%
For your consciousness and
your nonphysical energy,

00:30:21.915 --> 00:30:23.120 align:middle line:90%
it does not need a portal.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.515 align:middle line:90%
It's just moving seamlessly.

00:30:24.515 --> 00:30:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's close.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have this-- so it's almost
like we're riding a roller

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:84%
coaster in the sense of having
our own version of reality

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.805 align:middle line:84%
based on all the
potentials of reality.

00:30:34.805 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And to speak to
your question of why

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.540 align:middle line:84%
we're in one versus
the other, there's

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.610 align:middle line:84%
several reasons why we might
be in one version of reality

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.470 align:middle line:90%
versus the other.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.683 align:middle line:84%
One is what our
expectations are.

00:30:44.683 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:84%
We might have
certain expectations

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.470 align:middle line:84%
about who we are, about
how wealthy we are,

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.310 align:middle line:90%
how much we deserve love.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.310 align:middle line:84%
All these different things
are going to affect--

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those are
all conditioning.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, to--

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To the subconscious.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.497 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Then there
might be soul contracts.

00:30:57.497 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You came here to work with this
person or to help with this war

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.050 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.490 align:middle line:84%
There's soul contracts that
keep us in certain realities.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And then when you consider
all of those things, all

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.540 align:middle line:84%
of those things being
equal, the range

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.210 align:middle line:84%
of realities that you're
going to exist in then

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.190 align:middle line:90%
is affected by your vibration.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at like
a hot air balloon, a hot air

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:84%
balloon, when you
raise the vibration

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.510 align:middle line:84%
of the air in the hot air
balloon as you make it hotter,

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:30.800 align:middle line:84%
it's going to go up
to a higher place

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:90%
where the vibration is higher.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.210 align:middle line:84%
It's going to match the
outer vibration of the air

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.650 align:middle line:90%
outside and inside.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.172 align:middle line:84%
You cool it, which is
the lower vibration,

00:31:39.172 --> 00:31:40.380 align:middle line:90%
it's going to come back down.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.060 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
match that reality.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same with us.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Our vibration, the
way-- everybody I'm sure

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.425 align:middle line:84%
has a definition of
what our vibration is

00:31:49.425 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:90%
and how to change it.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:90%
But for me, it's very specific.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.960 align:middle line:84%
There's an enormous
amount of energy

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.170 align:middle line:84%
that we could
channel into our body

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:84%
through our energy
channels, our meridians,

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.078 align:middle line:84%
whatever, acupuncture
meridians, nadis,

00:32:01.078 --> 00:32:02.370 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call them.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:06.270 align:middle line:84%
There are channels for our life
force energy to come through.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:84%
If those channels
are blocked, then we

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:90%
can't channel that much.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.570 align:middle line:84%
If our channels are
completely open,

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:84%
there's no limit to how
much we can channel.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're usually
somewhere in between.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.897 align:middle line:84%
So depending on how much
energy you can channel,

00:32:19.897 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
affect your vibration.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:84%
The more energy you
can channel, and those

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:84%
are higher vibrational
energies, the higher

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.340 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go up in your
realm of possible experiences.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:84%
To get to that, you're going
to be at the highest level

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:32.500 align:middle line:90%
of your possible exposure.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to be
living at the highest level

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that you could
possibly be living--

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your potential.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.262 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: --of your potential.

00:32:37.262 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Conversely,
we get into patterns,

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.090 align:middle line:90%
something bad happens.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:40.590 align:middle line:90%
We have trauma.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can't stop
licking that thing.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:43.845 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah.

00:32:43.845 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We just keep
going back and picking at it

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:46.800 align:middle line:90%
and picking at it.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Let our mind grind on it.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe find other
people in our lives

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.570 align:middle line:90%
that will grind on it with us.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we're actually taking
ourselves to a lower potential.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
without our own knowledge,

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:90%
you're doing this all the time.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: So the
thing about trauma

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.860 align:middle line:84%
is that trauma actually does
cause blockages in your energy

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:06.660 align:middle line:90%
channels.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.440 align:middle line:90%
You dissociate.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.210 align:middle line:84%
You know when people say,
I don't want to go there.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:10.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to think about it.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And if the trauma
is so great, you

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:84%
don't even have memory
of it, which literally

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
means there's a part
of your energetic being

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.600 align:middle line:84%
that you can't go to which
means there's a blockage.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:90%
So trauma causes blockages.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
of it like a hose,

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.880 align:middle line:84%
a fire hose is pouring out
an enormous amount of water.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.505 align:middle line:84%
But if it was just
a garden hose trying

00:33:29.505 --> 00:33:30.922 align:middle line:84%
to pour that same
amount of water,

00:33:30.922 --> 00:33:32.400 align:middle line:84%
you can't because
it's too small,

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.190 align:middle line:84%
because the energy
channels are smaller.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.530 align:middle line:84%
In the same way if
there's a blockage, which

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.600 align:middle line:84%
is what trauma causes,
that's going to put you

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.940 align:middle line:90%
in a lower vibrational state.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in a lower
vibrational state,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.357 align:middle line:84%
things are going to
get lower and lower.

00:33:44.357 --> 00:33:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happens is bad things

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.480 align:middle line:84%
happen when you're in a
lower vibrational state.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
those are timelines

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:50.550 align:middle line:90%
that are your potentials, too.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Exactly.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It goes
both directions.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Exactly.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.445 align:middle line:84%
And then when the bad things
happen, you get angry.

00:33:54.445 --> 00:33:55.540 align:middle line:90%
You get upset.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:56.580 align:middle line:90%
You get stressed out.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.663 align:middle line:90%
You're in a fearful state.

00:33:57.663 --> 00:33:59.910 align:middle line:84%
All those things
cause more blockages

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and more constrictions to
the flow of your energy.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And that makes you
more and more dense

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.320 align:middle line:84%
because you can't channel
those higher vibrations.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:12.389 align:middle line:84%
So the way I saw it when
I look at the multiverse,

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I see it as an ocean
of possible universes.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's timelines going
all the way up like an ocean.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at an ocean, if
you're very dense like a stone,

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.520 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go down to
the bottom of the ocean.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.781 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you're like a
sponge, you have opening,

00:34:28.781 --> 00:34:29.739 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be at--

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're going to
rise, you're going to surf.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Rise
at the top, right.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So when your energy channels are
open, you become like a sponge

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and you rise to the higher
better versions of reality.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.949 align:middle line:84%
When you're blocked, you
become like the stone.

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:43.060 align:middle line:90%
And you go deeper and deeper.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:84%
So people end up in this vicious
cycle where they've had trauma.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:49.260 align:middle line:90%
It's causing them to go deeper.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.179 align:middle line:84%
Now, those deeper
versions of reality

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:54.630 align:middle line:84%
are just like in an
ocean when you go deeper,

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.620 align:middle line:90%
there's more pressure.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.280 align:middle line:90%
It's darker.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:56.820 align:middle line:90%
It's colder.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:90%
It's more constricted.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.880 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
The metaphor is very accurate
as far as this multiverse--

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's very important
when one experiences trauma.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can go back and
undo it in the past, too.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.892 align:middle line:84%
But when one experiences
it to not reinforce it.

00:35:10.892 --> 00:35:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why
this popped to mind,

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.250 align:middle line:84%
it may not be at all relevant,
but it popped into my mind.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:16.410 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to say it.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:17.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's personal.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And so on two
occasions, and one was

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.380 align:middle line:84%
my best friend's
older brother, I

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.630 align:middle line:84%
experienced being
drugged, date rape.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't seem to
carry the trauma forward.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:32.460 align:middle line:84%
My body knew what was going on,
but I had absolutely no memory.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.020 align:middle line:90%
So my mind wasn't engaged.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.920 align:middle line:90%
My emotions weren't engaged.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.015 align:middle line:84%
So what constitutes
trauma in that case?

00:35:39.015 --> 00:35:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, that's
the toughest type of trauma

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.530 align:middle line:84%
to deal with because your
mind is dissociated from it.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I had no idea.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.685 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: It's still
very much trauma.

00:35:46.685 --> 00:35:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And we have different
versions of that.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have worked
with people where

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.270 align:middle line:84%
after working with
them for six months,

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:55.090 align:middle line:84%
that's when they finally
have a memory of something

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:57.140 align:middle line:84%
similar to that of
being drugged and--

00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And so that has to
be worked through like hypnosis

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:84%
or regression analysis,
regression therapy,

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.780 align:middle line:90%
cellular release.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because even
though you don't remember,

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.650 align:middle line:84%
it's not registering, you
don't have emotions around it,

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:90%
it's in there.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.492 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: That's the most
severe type of trauma.

00:36:12.492 --> 00:36:15.160 align:middle line:84%
The most severe type of trauma
you either don't remember it

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.785 align:middle line:84%
or you don't have
any emotion toward it

00:36:16.785 --> 00:36:18.940 align:middle line:84%
or you just, I don't
want to go there.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.710 align:middle line:90%
And that has to be integrated.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:25.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a great analogy in
the 2016 movie "King Arthur"

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.460 align:middle line:90%
that was made by Guy Ritchie.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.070 align:middle line:90%
He was the director.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know I saw that.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: It was
really well done.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:35.367 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: But here's the thing
that was so cool about it.

00:36:35.367 --> 00:36:37.135 align:middle line:90%
So the boy, King Arthur--

00:36:37.135 --> 00:36:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, refresh me.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.552 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying remember the scenes.

00:36:39.552 --> 00:36:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: It follows his
life just from childhood

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:47.200 align:middle line:84%
where he sees his parents,
the king and the queen,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.920 align:middle line:84%
getting killed by his uncle
who was a monster at the time.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes
off and is raised

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.900 align:middle line:90%
in a brothel in Londinium.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And he has no memory, no
memory of being king or prince

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.400 align:middle line:84%
or his parents being
kings, none of that.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.567 align:middle line:84%
He just thinks he spent his
whole life in a brothel.

00:37:03.567 --> 00:37:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And when he was a teenager,
the sword in the stone

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:90%
appeared at--

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.200 align:middle line:84%
it was underwater
and then it appeared.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And everybody had
to try it to see who

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:17.000 align:middle line:90%
the king was, who Arthur was.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.120 align:middle line:90%
And he had to.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:18.920 align:middle line:90%
He had no choice.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.790 align:middle line:90%
He had to try it.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So he tried it not expecting
it and he pulled it right out.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.742 align:middle line:84%
And the second he pulled
it out, his eyes glow.

00:37:25.742 --> 00:37:26.950 align:middle line:90%
He's getting all this energy.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:27.750 align:middle line:90%
He has his memory.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.040 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he gets
all this energy,

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.630 align:middle line:84%
he's getting a memory
that he doesn't

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.710 align:middle line:84%
know what this
memory is, but he's

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:34.090 align:middle line:90%
seeing someone being killed.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:35.500 align:middle line:90%
He passes out.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And so for for a large
portion of the movie,

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.350 align:middle line:84%
he can't channel the
energy of the sword.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Because every time he looks--
he picks up the sword,

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.360 align:middle line:84%
all he sees is painful memory
that he doesn't want to see.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So he has to go on this
journey, a healing journey,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.100 align:middle line:84%
where he's finally able
to see the whole thing.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.330 align:middle line:90%
He sees the whole thing.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:53.470 align:middle line:90%
He remembers.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.180 align:middle line:84%
He watches his
father being killed.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.980 align:middle line:84%
He watches his
mother being killed.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.010 align:middle line:84%
He integrates this trauma
that was so severe that he was

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.340 align:middle line:90%
completely dissociated from it.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And then he could channel
the sword, the energy.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: And it's
an incredible analogy.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't know
that I did see that film.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:08.130 align:middle line:90%
What is it called?

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: It's either called
"Arthur" or "King Arthur,"

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:11.510 align:middle line:90%
2016.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
remember that, 2016.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Guy Ritchie.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Lionel
Richie's brother.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was great.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Really well directed.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm writing it down.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.080 align:middle line:90%
I have it on my list.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.205 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: But I don't know
if they were conscious,

00:38:22.205 --> 00:38:23.390 align:middle line:90%
if that was their intention.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
what they did.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, it's
a perfect analogy

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.450 align:middle line:84%
of how you have to
integrate trauma in order

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.370 align:middle line:90%
to channel higher vibrations.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you channel
the high vibrations,

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.030 align:middle line:84%
that's specifically how
you get to the higher

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.650 align:middle line:90%
versions of reality.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about how we
move between multiverses.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Is there a portal?

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.870 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
five minutes left.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:42.520 align:middle line:90%
I want to get into this.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.687 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:43.687 --> 00:38:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how do we
then consciously move

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.250 align:middle line:84%
within this multiverse
to parallel realities?

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, it's
not through portals

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:51.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's our
consciousness is moving.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:90%
It's our nonphysical.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
don't need a portal.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: We don't
need a portal.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.320 align:middle line:84%
It's our nonphysical
reality that's moving.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And the way to do it, the way I
do it is I spend a lot of time

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.620 align:middle line:84%
doing a visualization where
I'm imagining white light first

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.740 align:middle line:84%
in my navel and then coming
up through the ground,

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.990 align:middle line:84%
through my feet, and
then through my head,

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:90%
and then through my arms.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And so in all these different
ways as I'm visualizing this,

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.210 align:middle line:90%
it's opening my channels.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
visualize energy

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:19.780 align:middle line:84%
going through your channels,
you're opening them.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I feel
that my channels

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.740 align:middle line:84%
are so open that it could
handle any level of transmission

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.540 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
ask my higher self

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:32.710 align:middle line:84%
to completely occupy my body
with the highest energies

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I actually feel this like
explosion of white light

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:90%
go through my body.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.175 align:middle line:84%
And then I know I'm
in like the highest--

00:39:39.175 --> 00:39:40.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving to the
highest reality possible

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.123 align:middle line:84%
because I've raised my vibration
to the highest extent possible.

00:39:44.123 --> 00:39:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
I do every day now.

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing it for
years and years and years.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:49.750 align:middle line:90%
And it always leads me--

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I never try to specifically
say, I want to get this job

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.700 align:middle line:84%
or I want to get
this relationship.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't do anything like that.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I just get into the place
where I'm completely open.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'd visualize, let's say,
if I wanted more abundance,

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.740 align:middle line:84%
for example, you can
visualize the feeling, what

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.750 align:middle line:84%
does that feel like
to-- what would

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.845 align:middle line:84%
you feel like if you had
all the money you wanted,

00:40:09.845 --> 00:40:11.470 align:middle line:84%
or you had the
relationship you wanted,

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.845 align:middle line:84%
or you had the body you wanted,
what does that feel like?

00:40:13.845 --> 00:40:16.480 align:middle line:84%
You get into that vibrational
state of that feeling.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.170 align:middle line:84%
You let these higher vibrations
come in and amplify that.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to go to
the version of reality that's

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.480 align:middle line:90%
going to give you that feeling.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It may not be the exact
job that you visualized.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe you
should visualize an exact job

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:30.700 align:middle line:90%
or it may not be--

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: --the
exact relationship.

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think you
should visualize it.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But what you'll be in,
you will be in a reality

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.150 align:middle line:90%
where you are feeling--

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Feeling.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.508 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: --the way you
would feel if you had

00:40:41.508 --> 00:40:42.800 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is that you wanted.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And you usually do have it,
but it's never exactly the way

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.860 align:middle line:90%
you think it is.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But then you get into a place
where, wow, I feel abundant.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.515 align:middle line:90%
I feel loved.

00:40:50.515 --> 00:40:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm in
incredible shape.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.720 align:middle line:90%
The world is at peace.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not just you.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.240 align:middle line:90%
It's the world.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when we think
that the world the problems

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:03.230 align:middle line:84%
are too big for us, whether it's
a war, or famine, or pandemic,

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.140 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, that
can be changed too

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.890 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
version of reality where

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:10.610 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't exist to that
extent, and you can move to it.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.490 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to feel
powerless to that.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:15.320 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
move to avert the--

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To the other--

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: --to the
version of reality--

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --timeline.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.662 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: --where
it's not happening

00:41:18.662 --> 00:41:22.000 align:middle line:84%
or where it's happening
better, in a better situation.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does this not lead
in a sense to mass psychosis

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.820 align:middle line:84%
with everyone on
their own timelines

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.477 align:middle line:84%
in different
versions of reality?

00:41:28.477 --> 00:41:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, I think
it is a mindblower.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:32.490 align:middle line:84%
It is a mindblower
because the reality is

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:90%
we are all on our own timeline.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.320 align:middle line:84%
We're interacting--
to some extent,

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.000 align:middle line:84%
yours is slightly
different than mine.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's 99.999% the
same, but there'll always

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.132 align:middle line:84%
be some differences as we
make different choices.

00:41:45.132 --> 00:41:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And then if there
are huge choices,

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.460 align:middle line:90%
there'll be huge differences.

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:90%
So it does blow your mind.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really
is mind-bending.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So to recap what you said, you
have a practice where you go in

00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and you start allowing the
brilliant white prana to flow

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:84%
in through your feet,
up into your core,

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and from above, down below,
and ultimately an explosion.

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So it goes all the way
out into your extremities,

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.980 align:middle line:84%
which raises your
vibrational frequency which--

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.705 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Because that's the
higher vibrational energy,

00:42:12.705 --> 00:42:13.505 align:middle line:90%
exactly.

00:42:13.505 --> 00:42:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that
puts you in a position

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.450 align:middle line:84%
then to start employing
your thoughts,

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:21.000 align:middle line:84%
your desires, feelings,
ideas, or whatever,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.980 align:middle line:90%
while you're in that state.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you
automatically kind of move

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.347 align:middle line:90%
timelines into this new reality.

00:42:28.347 --> 00:42:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Well, if you
go back to the ocean

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.640 align:middle line:84%
of universes analogy, imagine
you're a scuba diver, right?

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So a scuba diver is going to
have this buoyancy compensator,

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.260 align:middle line:90%
it's called.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So if he wants to go up, he puts
more oxygen and the buoyancy--

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.380 align:middle line:90%
he goes up automatically.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.422 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're doing.

00:42:44.422 --> 00:42:46.200 align:middle line:90%
You're going up automatically.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.500 align:middle line:90%
You will go up automatically.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.480 align:middle line:84%
When you create the feeling,
the desired feeling that you

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.830 align:middle line:84%
want of being abundant, or
being loved, or being safe,

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:54.630 align:middle line:90%
you create that.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.120 align:middle line:84%
You amplify it with
the higher energies.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.720 align:middle line:84%
You open your channels enough
to channel the highest energies

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.350 align:middle line:84%
possible, mega amplifies it,
and then you go up automatically

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:05.760 align:middle line:90%
to that version of reality.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.757 align:middle line:84%
And that's a way to live life
that's completely empowering.

00:43:09.757 --> 00:43:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.653 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: Yeah, because you're
all the time getting yourself--

00:43:13.653 --> 00:43:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're the author.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.275 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: Yes.

00:43:15.275 --> 00:43:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You are in
control, in a sense.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But you have to allow for the
uncertainty of exactly what it

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.990 align:middle line:90%
looks like.

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:23.070 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with you.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't put
something specific.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Like for women who are-- say,
a man or a woman who wants

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:90%
a partner and is feeling--

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.068 align:middle line:84%
they want that
love and affection.

00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So you would move through
this beautiful process,

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:36.540 align:middle line:84%
you said, but feel
yourself feeling--

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: What
does that feel like.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the exquisite kind
of love, love or affection

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that you're bathed
in in that moment.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.220 align:middle line:90%
You can't see anything.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.400 align:middle line:90%
You don't know who it is.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.830 align:middle line:90%
But you feel it.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:49.095 align:middle line:90%
Feeling is sticky.

00:43:49.095 --> 00:43:50.220 align:middle line:90%
And it will take you there.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: It's an energy.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's an energy.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.600 align:middle line:10%
>>GABRIEL: And even if
there is someone specific

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.160 align:middle line:10%
that you want, like say
you're in love with someone,

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.010 align:middle line:10%
then you ask the question
like, what do you imagine it

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:02.380 align:middle line:10%
would feel like if you
were with that person.

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And then what I
usually do is I take

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.090 align:middle line:84%
that feeling, and
so vibration, I

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:09.670 align:middle line:84%
imagine every cell in my body
vibrating with that feeling.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:10.470 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:13.500 align:middle line:10%
That's a nice completion
piece because we're almost out

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.450 align:middle line:10%
of time and, wow, it just flew.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:20.070 align:middle line:10%
And I know that you do workshops
and talks and your website,

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:20.950 align:middle line:10%
The Gabriel Method.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:21.750 align:middle line:10%
It's there.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:22.710 align:middle line:10%
You're there for people.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:23.010 align:middle line:10%
>>GABRIEL: Absolutely.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.843 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So any final
thought before we go?

00:44:24.843 --> 00:44:26.343 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL: There's
just nothing more

00:44:26.343 --> 00:44:28.440 align:middle line:84%
important than doing the
internal work of raising

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.720 align:middle line:84%
your own vibration, of
opening your energy channels,

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.820 align:middle line:84%
asking your higher self
to work through you,

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.818 align:middle line:84%
and then allowing
the magic to happen.

00:44:35.818 --> 00:44:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much,
Jon, for joining us today.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It's been very
truly inspirational.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: My pleasure.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Appreciate it.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GABRIEL: It's been fun.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope you found
this absolutely fascinating

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.170 align:middle line:90%
like I have.

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I love it when old concepts,
such as law of attraction,

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.850 align:middle line:84%
are brought into a deeper
concept of knowledge

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:51.990 align:middle line:90%
and are made useful.

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:53.910 align:middle line:10%
