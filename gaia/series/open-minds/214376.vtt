>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We have a woman

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.280 align:middle line:10%
with us today that
has a story that's

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:10%
going to inspire everybody.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:10%
She's been through challenges
most of us cannot even imagine.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:84%
But through her own
spirit and choices,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:84%
she has transformed her
life from a powerless girl

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
in Pakistan to a NASA scientist
who consciously uses the quantum

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
field to create her reality,
not just every day, every moment

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:90%
of every day.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%

it's all about now.

>>SHEHNAZ SONI:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And I love the way you
actually pretty much summed it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.360 align:middle line:90%
all for me.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.275 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

>>REGINA: Well, now we
get to hear your story.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:90%
And some of it--

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I just want to warn people, some
of it is painful to listen to.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's so important to
understand whatever it is we've

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:90%
chosen to incarnate into--

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and only you know and I know why
we chose the lives we chose--

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:84%
that every single moment
with each passing thought

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and each passing desire
in each moment of passion,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:84%
you can move that into
something 180 degrees opposite

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.915 align:middle line:90%
as you have done.

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:19.715 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: 100%.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know
you're very open.

00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate you
sharing your story.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
let's get to it.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:84%
You were born in Pakistan to
more of an upper middle-class

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.690 align:middle line:84%
family but not in necessarily
happy circumstance.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.208 align:middle line:90%
Your dad was not a happy man.

00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: No, because he didn't--

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.958 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
was very paternal.

00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's set up your
home life for us.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yes.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.280 align:middle line:10%
So it was interesting because
my dad was an outlier.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:10%
So he was an outlier
in the society

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:10%
because he was an extremely--

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.410 align:middle line:10%
he was a very
incredible photographer

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:10%
who would take a picture of a
donkey that has a skin disease

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:10%
right outside the skin clinic.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:10%
So his pictures would
publish on the newspaper.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:10%
And he even got called
by National Geographic,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:10%
except that right
around that time,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:10%
he gets married
to a very young--

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:10%
a girl that's like 13
years younger than him.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And then he asks the girl that
should we move to America?

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:90%
They both didn't speak English.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the girl
is barely like just

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
dealing with all of those
arranged marriage and all that.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So basically, my father did
not make the right decision.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:90%
And from that point on--

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He betrayed himself.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Exactly.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And from that point
on and when I got born

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that I was a girl
in the patriarchal culture

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:90%
did not help.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up experiencing
my father's regret for life

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.150 align:middle line:90%
because everybody--

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
that is the way
quantum field works.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:84%
That is how we
work when we don't

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
do what we need to
do for ourselves,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.515 align:middle line:84%
then people who are close
to us get the brunt of it.

00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And you were in a culture
because of the depth and history

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:84%
of the traditions
and the way of being,

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that there's a way to do
things, and you do it that way,

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
that you seemingly don't
have a lot of free will even.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, yes,
he betrayed himself,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.750 align:middle line:84%
but I would guess most
people do in a culture that's

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:90%
that repressive.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: That is
very true, actually.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
What he did, you're right, it's
because the culture does not

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:84%
enable you to do something
that's beyond your imagination.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
For him to leave Pakistan
was beyond his imagination.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
He was hoping that somebody
else can hold his hand.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.720 align:middle line:84%
But that is the actual message,
that majority of the time when

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
you're in a deprived
situation like that,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to wait for
the knight in shining armor,

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to be not
able to exit that reality.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to get
all the courage like Sleeping

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
with the enemy like Julia
Roberts does, that you learn

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:90%
how to swim to cross the ocean.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.122 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what I did
in a very incremental way.

00:03:45.122 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you did.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.788 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: And to some
extent, I didn't even

00:03:47.788 --> 00:03:51.125 align:middle line:84%
realize I was doing it because I
just wasn't giving up on myself.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, you had
that, even though you

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
saw your father had, which
embittered him and made

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
him not particularly
easy to live

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.725 align:middle line:90%
with for the rest of the family.

00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And maybe he was hoping that
somehow this girl would just

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
magically light him up, and they
could just, as two young people,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:90%
run off to America together.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:84%
You ultimately did
run off to America.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Not that easy.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:90%
It took quite a lot.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's go through your childhood.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.612 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into a
really difficult part,

00:04:14.612 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:84%
especially for Western
females, because

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
of what you went through
traditionally in your family.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And so by this time,
are you in school?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.922 align:middle line:84%
At what age did you start
going to school first?

00:04:25.922 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Yeah, so you
basically go in the school

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.390 align:middle line:90%
at a similar age as here.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I was in
like a kindergarten

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.090 align:middle line:90%
and those preschools.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was very, very good
with school, so I was always--

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
that was my escape from all
the challenges in life, so yes.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because your mind
could go to new places.

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Exactly.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
still part of the culture.

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the part
of the book where

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:84%
you were taken away
to an auntie's house

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't know why
you were going there.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the same kind of
home that you were used to.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Just set up the whole
scenario so we can get into

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and pass this part of the story
because it's so challenging.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Yeah, so that is the
thing, actually that experience,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
partly because it
was so painful.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.482 align:middle line:90%
So at the age of seven--

00:05:14.482 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:84%
so basically, Pakistan
is majority Muslims,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.935 align:middle line:90%
like 98% Muslims.

00:05:19.935 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:90%
And Muslims have Sunni and Shia.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So these are
categories of Islam.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And Shia has a category of
another subcategory called

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:90%
Bohra.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was born into that
particular, you can say,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.620 align:middle line:84%
subreligion because it has
its own way of doing things.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And they believed in FGM, so
Female Genital Mutilation.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.490 align:middle line:90%
They believed in that.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:90%
And the age was seven.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:90%
So everybody who was born in--

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.817 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this the
normal age that happens?

00:05:48.817 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: That has been the
normal age for the longest time.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.917 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you
something that's

00:05:52.917 --> 00:05:54.760 align:middle line:84%
even more alarming,
is that now they're

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
doing it at the age of three,
which is what I learned

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:84%
because I was checking in
to just see if they're still

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.130 align:middle line:90%
doing it.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.422 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that they're
doing it a little sooner now

00:06:03.422 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
because people like me--
because at the age of seven--

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you will
remember it even

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.498 align:middle line:84%
if you do it at the age of three
because it traumatizes you.

00:06:10.498 --> 00:06:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, how could it not?

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.737 align:middle line:84%
So she takes you
into the kitchen or?

00:06:13.737 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: So basically,
the way it works

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
is that, yeah,
you actually don't

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.872 align:middle line:90%
know when it's going to happen.

00:06:17.872 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:90%
You are not-- planned for it.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:84%
You just go into
someone's house.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that you
spend such a sheltered life

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.233 align:middle line:84%
with your parents that
whenever you're outside,

00:06:26.233 --> 00:06:27.900 align:middle line:84%
you're either with
your mom or your dad.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So when your mom doesn't
even go with you to a place

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
with your cousin,

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
you're already wondering that,
why is my mom not coming?

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Something's wrong.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Something is wrong.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So I already was like,
why is my mom not coming?

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
My mom always comes because
either my mom or dad is always

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:90%
So that raised a concern.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to a
strange person's house.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there
is something about--

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's where I think
the quantum field--

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
morphogenetic field plays
a role in because now I

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:90%
can understand that in my--

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I remember that I was
feeling uncomfortable

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.357 align:middle line:84%
even while we were journeying
into her house, right?

00:07:00.357 --> 00:07:01.648 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I remember that.

00:07:01.648 --> 00:07:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Like I had no idea what
I'm going to get into, but I

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.925 align:middle line:90%
was--

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was wrong.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:90%
Something was wrong.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.677 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Something was wrong.

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was definitely vibrating
at really high beta frequency

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
because all my antennas are on.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to understand
that what is going to happen.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:90%
And then even my cousin--

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
once that auntie
comes into the picture

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:84%
that I have never seen
before, the cousin

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
just completely just disappears
because nobody wants to see it,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
because everybody
knows how painful it is

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and especially the way they
do it without you knowing.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.940 align:middle line:84%
You're not being
prepared at all.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You weren't prepared.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And you weren't physically
prepared in any way.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.876 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though you
have an anesthetic.

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:39.676 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Nothing.

00:07:39.676 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what does she use?

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.997 align:middle line:90%
What does she use?

00:07:42.997 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:90%
How did she do this?

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.212 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: She doesn't
use anything.

00:07:45.212 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you're not
prepared spiritually,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:84%
mentally, emotionally,
physically.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.778 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you go to her, then
she puts you down like a baby.

00:07:53.778 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And then still you have no
idea what she's going to do.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:90%
So you feel like that--

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
when she takes
your underwear off,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:84%
you feel like somebody
changing her diaper.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.888 align:middle line:90%
It's like that position.

00:08:03.888 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You still don't know.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
But you're seven, so you're
more cognitively aware.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Right.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.195 align:middle line:84%
And then the only time you
really feel it is when--

00:08:11.195 --> 00:08:12.380 align:middle line:90%
she used the blade.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:90%
She used the blade to do it.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So when you feel the
pain, then you scream.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.735 align:middle line:84%
And then there are other
people who are holding you

00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:84%
because now you're going to
scream, you're going to move,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.402 align:middle line:90%
you're going to mess things up.

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:90%
So there are people there.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.915 align:middle line:84%
All of them are
holding your hand

00:08:25.915 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and your feet and everything
while she's working on.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.885 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it quick?

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.076 align:middle line:90%
Is it fairly quick?

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:35.159 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: So now, that's a
great question, actually.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
were in such trauma,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.554 align:middle line:90%
probably time gets distorted.

00:08:38.554 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: That is very
true because it's almost

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.585 align:middle line:84%
like time does slow down,
especially when you are feeling

00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:84%
like there are just too many
unknowns that are happening.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you don't even know
how long it's going to last.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you are
completely, I mean,

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
like trapped with
all these people

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to make sure
that you don't make a noise,

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.237 align:middle line:84%
you don't scream, you
don't do all that.

00:08:56.237 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So I don't remember
exactly the time.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I did remember the pain.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:90%
I remember the helplessness.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:90%
And I think that to me--

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
anybody who understands
anything about emotions

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle line:84%
or how all these
things that gets--

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:84%
triggered for the
rest of your life,

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that helplessness
has been one of my--

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, one of my
biggest trigger in life.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For sure.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.190 align:middle line:90%
How could it not be?

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: I felt it at the
extreme level at that point.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the irony is even
after you're done and then she

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:84%
bandages you and all that, and
then you are-- so first of all,

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I felt extremely betrayed
that my mom wasn't there--

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Would allow this.

00:09:33.175 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: --and allowed it.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And she wasn't
there to protect me.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:90%
So that was a huge betrayal.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
And then you can't walk.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
holding you and stuff.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you are
told while you're

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
going home is that you can't
talk about this to your dad,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.990 align:middle line:84%
to your brothers,
to your anyone.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.270 align:middle line:84%
This is something you're
going to keep it secret.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're being
programmed to not

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:84%
talk about it
because it's almost

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.470 align:middle line:84%
like you already know that
you're doing something wrong.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.512 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why would you want
to hush, hush so much?

00:09:59.512 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's part of
your cultural tradition.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Because that's
how they keep everybody

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:90%
to keep following this.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And everybody really
follows it diligently.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.168 align:middle line:84%
You wont even believe people who
live in other part of the world,

00:10:10.168 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:84%
they go out of their way
to take their daughters

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:90%
to get this done in Pakistan.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe that?

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.205 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:10:17.205 --> 00:10:19.247 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: And that is the
irony of the whole thing,

00:10:19.247 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:84%
is like when you're
programmed to do something.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And it violates you
in every which way.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the
chakra that they're

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:84%
interacting with, I mean,
the creative chakra.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --Chakra.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, honestly,
it's still done commonly

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.427 align:middle line:90%
to our baby boys in the West.

00:10:37.427 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: That's true.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.718 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
still commonly done.

00:10:39.718 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when that
choice came for my son,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to do it.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But I was talked into
it by medical staff.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know
any better at the time.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.265 align:middle line:84%
It just felt wrong and
hearing the screams.

00:10:52.265 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not like it's painless.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:90%
And for what?

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And so this causes,
I think, a deep--

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
only maybe a day or two

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
old in these cases
in the hospital,

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
it can't help but create
a horrible trauma within,

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.647 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't have memory
of it by the time you're seven.

00:11:10.647 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole different--

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: That's a whole
different-- because now you've

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:90%
collected so much.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the very
fact that you--

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
so those were the memory for me
because the pain afterwards--

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and then the pain
lasts for a while.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell anyone
that you're in pain.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:90%
You can't express it.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:84%
You're still confused that
why your mom didn't show up

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
because nobody wants to
talk about it because it's

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:90%
a huge hush, hush.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's like all of these
things are just packed there.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the interesting
thing about me is, by the way,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:84%
that I did not realize until I
got married and came to America.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I was talking to
another Muslim girl in America,

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:84%
that's when I realized
that what we're doing

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
is only done in the
border cult. I actually

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.590 align:middle line:84%
did not know that all
of the Muslim girls

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.090 align:middle line:90%
don't go through it.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was almost like
a light bulb moment in my life

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
that I actually realized that
what this is, is actually wrong.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, what I'm saying
is, I didn't even

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
know that it was wrong
because I was not--

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I knew that
I didn't feel good.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But I never knew that
it was actually wrong.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
realized it was wrong,

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
then I started asking the
questions to the community

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:90%
that why are we doing it.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And they say we do
it for cleanliness.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.505 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
because otherwise you

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
are not going to ever be
able to clean yourself up.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:84%
But then later on, I
realized that the main reason

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
they were doing it is because
they were worried about women

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:84%
running away from
their men, actually,

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:84%
because they actually wanted
to deprive your sexual feelings

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
because if you
feel good, then you

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
may end up using sex as a reason
to move from one man to another.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And sex is a huge deal.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a Muslim
growing up, you

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:84%
don't learn about even
what it means until you're

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.630 align:middle line:84%
about to hand off to
another strange man whom

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.903 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to perform--

00:12:49.903 --> 00:12:52.320 align:middle line:84%
whom you're supposed to perform
like kings and queens used

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:90%
to do, right?

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.762 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: It's like now you have
to perform because everybody's

00:12:55.762 --> 00:12:58.630 align:middle line:84%
expecting that you just had
a handshake in one hour,

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and next thing is that you
are in bed experiencing them.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what the hell
is wrong with that?

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.803 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you
believe the extreme?

00:13:06.803 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, that's why
it's so interesting for you

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:84%
to share this story because
we don't understand this.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
People from the West
don't understand it.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.465 align:middle line:90%
And I think a lot of--

00:13:15.465 --> 00:13:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it's surprising to a
lot of people watching this

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually
still a common practice

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:90%
in certain religious sects.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:90%
So you've shared that with us.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you once you-- did
it harm you in such a way

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that that feeling of
betrayal and somehow

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.280 align:middle line:84%
mistrust, disconnection
with family

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.085 align:middle line:84%
actually went a little deeper
inside and stayed with you?

00:13:38.085 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: I think that
it did stay with me,

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
which is the reason I did
what I did in the prior part

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.435 align:middle line:90%
of my life, having to--

00:13:45.435 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:90%
it's almost like you--

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.478 align:middle line:84%
there are two ways you can make
people do things, love or fear.

00:13:50.478 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it,
the culture that I come from

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and what they did to us is
all operating off of fear,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:84%
fear of you running
away or fear of you

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.470 align:middle line:84%
following your freedom,
fear of leaving

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:90%
men, fear of leaving religion.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So all of those fears, that was
the reason that they did that.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Interesting thing is that in the
year 2000, almost 24 years ago,

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I actually turned the switch
off on that, all of those fears,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:84%
because I actually divorced
the very man that my culture

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and tradition wanted
me to stay with.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.617 align:middle line:90%
We're hopping forward a bit.

00:14:23.617 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:90%
So you do end up married.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:90%
And it is an arranged marriage.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:90%
But you also are quite smart.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that
math and science really

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
is how you-- that's kind of a
template you operate through

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is wired
naturally for this, right?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yes.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you enjoyed school.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.676 align:middle line:90%
You became an engineer.

00:14:42.676 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And you got married and
you ended up in America.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So now you're smart,
you're in school,

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:84%
you marry this man in
an arranged marriage,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:90%
and you end up in America.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what happened
throughout that.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: To get to America.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting thing is
that so in my entire childhood,

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I was raised with the mindset
that I will ultimately end up

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
getting married based on my
culture's choice, arranged

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:90%
marriage.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I will live
the life that whatever

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
my husband and my in-laws
will decide as a fate.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So that was pretty
much the script that

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:90%
was already written for me.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was very pragmatic,
so he would remind me

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.480 align:middle line:84%
of the script that it's going
to be all about me making a meal

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:90%
plan in the kitchen.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:90%
That would be my life.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:90%
So he had a vision of that.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I never
understood that vision

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.395 align:middle line:84%
because that had no
excitement attached to it.

00:15:33.395 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the
exciting thing was

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to watch Star Trek that
I didn't understand.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
you didn't speak English.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.712 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: I didn't speak English.

00:15:39.712 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Exciting thing for me was to
get as high a grade as possible

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
because to me, learning
and understanding

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:90%
was the biggest quest in life.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So I became a valedictorian
in spite of the fact

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:84%
that I was discouraged
to go to school.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was
a valedictorian,

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and then even then, I wanted
to be a doctor, and I couldn't.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And I had to choose engineering
out of limited choices.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.522 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in the school.

00:15:59.522 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm doing really amazing.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I have this
proposal that comes.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.357 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
about this proposal,

00:16:04.357 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it just so happens that
one of my really good friends

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.160 align:middle line:90%
was getting married.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:90%
And I was her bridesmaid.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So I was wearing this sari that
is a very traditional outfit.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:90%
And one of my cousins sees me.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 21 years old.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking 21 years old
in that beautiful, sexy outfit.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:90%
So she sees me.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And she basically says, she's
perfect for my first husband

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
because my first husband's
sister and her were friend.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So you see there is
that connection there.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.682 align:middle line:84%
So this is how the
arranged marriage works,

00:16:34.682 --> 00:16:37.450 align:middle line:84%
is that you see someone and you
say, you know what, this is it.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to recommend
him to come see her.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So who proposes, the
in-laws, the man, your parents

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:90%
just tell you?

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:90%
How does a proposal happen?

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: So the proposal comes is
that everybody in the community

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
knows when you are
at a certain age.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, starting
from 16, everybody

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
is keeping an eye on you
because you are like--

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.615 align:middle line:84%
and you can't go too far
because, otherwise, you're going

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:90%
to be an old maid pretty fast.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason I was able
to dodge the bullet up to 21

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.770 align:middle line:84%
is because I was
a valedictorian.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.598 align:middle line:84%
I was very serious
about my education.

00:17:03.598 --> 00:17:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I would have
been married before that.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.560 align:middle line:90%
So I'm 21.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I
get seen by this.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And then they come to the house,
for example, the mutual party,

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
my cousin would come
to my dad and mom

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and say, you know
what, we really see

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:90%
a very good proposal for her.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:90%
It looks really good.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Everything checks off.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.660 align:middle line:84%
How about we create a meeting
for all of them to meet?

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.015 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it works.

00:17:26.015 --> 00:17:28.387 align:middle line:84%
And that same party goes to
the other party and says,

00:17:28.387 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:84%
I have this girl I think
that he's going to like--

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:90%
So they choreograph all of that.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:90%
And he had seven girls lined up.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:90%
I was the fifth girl.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:90%
I was the fifth girl.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we are basically--
we are only given one hour.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.073 align:middle line:84%
So basically, we
are giving one hour.

00:17:43.073 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you believe it's
about the same time

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:84%
you and I are going to have
and you decide your entire life

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:90%
script?

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe that?

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In an hour.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.225 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:17:50.225 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: And then in that one
hour, he actually interviewed.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me
all the questions.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you
know how to cook?

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.118 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:90%
He said, can you speak English?

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So he was asking and I was--
and he was like completely

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:84%
taken by my honesty because
he can see that, oh my God,

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.650 align:middle line:84%
she's really not
even saying yeah.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.535 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, I can make
a tea and I can make rice.

00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:90%
So I was very honest about--

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can keep us alive.

00:18:13.575 --> 00:18:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: And then I said that--

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
when he said, do
you speak English?

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, I can tell you Newton's
first, second, and third law

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.490 align:middle line:84%
of motion in English
because science was still

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:90%
taught in English.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So I was very honest
about everything.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:90%
And I think he liked that.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:84%
He was like taken by
the fact-- and then

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
he knew about me
being a valedictorian.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So he knew that this
girl has a potential

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.340 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
survive in America,

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.170 align:middle line:84%
even though she
doesn't speak English.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I only ask
him one question.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I said, will I be
able to continue

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:90%
my education after marriage?

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes, of course.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:45.937 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bingo.

00:18:45.937 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: That was it.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:47.687 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was it.

00:18:47.687 --> 00:18:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, meanwhile, you were not
dating around during this time

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
because you knew
how the culture was.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And you did not
want to put yourself

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
in a precarious position,
because there's also

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:57.965 align:middle line:90%
such a thing as honor killing.

00:18:57.965 --> 00:18:58.765 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: 100%.

00:18:58.765 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Please share with us what
honor killing was all about

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.075 align:middle line:84%
and why you didn't
choose to date.

00:19:05.075 --> 00:19:05.875 align:middle line:90%
Smart girl.

00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Honor killing generally,
which is such a wrong way

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to even sell that perception,
if you think about it, where men

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:17.630 align:middle line:84%
uses the fact that they can kill
a woman just because supposedly,

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:84%
what they are doing,
if they spend a night

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.670 align:middle line:84%
outside of the household,
then they can kill them.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Even if they were
not raped, even

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:84%
if they didn't have
any intercourse,

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day, if
they are outside at night

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:84%
without the permission of the
man that is in charge of them,

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
then they basically feel
like they have a permission

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.990 align:middle line:90%
to kill them for that.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, if
you're in your household

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and, say, you did meet up with
a boy to chat or something

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
but you were gone all
night, would your father

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:90%
have the right to do that?

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Who has the right
to kill a girl?

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Is it a spouse?

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
If your spouse has
been out all night

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:84%
or if they think that you've
maybe fooled around with a boy

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:84%
before marriage,
who can kill you?

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: So basically,
all the people

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
who believe that they represent
the men in your life, so

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
all your blood
relatives and especially

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
your father, your brother,
your uncle, because you are

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.380 align:middle line:84%
like-- it's like you are a
representation of a respect

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're supposed to stay
in a certain parameter.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:90%
So if you do anything unknown--

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and then see, it's a
very fear-based culture.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So they have created this so
nobody can dare fall in love,

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
nobody can run away with
the man that they love,

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.920 align:middle line:84%
nobody can do that because
at the end of the day,

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
they would beat the
life out of you.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:90%
You risk your life.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's-- yeah.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: And then they really
usually really mess up

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
both of their lives
because both of them

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.810 align:middle line:90%
will be definitely separated.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And they will both be married
off to some really undesirable

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.075 align:middle line:90%
people because--

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if the
woman makes it through--

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.075 align:middle line:84%
lives through it,
the experience.

00:20:47.075 --> 00:20:47.875 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Exactly.

00:20:47.875 --> 00:20:48.675 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:48.675 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So that is the thing
that honor killing--

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:84%
so it depends on the
literacy rate of the place.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So like in villages,
of course, they

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:90%
do that more than the cities.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So if the literacy rate
is a little higher,

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.927 align:middle line:90%
then people are more educated.

00:20:59.927 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So you would say that
they have a little bit

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.680 align:middle line:90%
more-- consciousness about it.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So like my father is not
someone who would have done it

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:90%
because he was educated.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
intellectual in his own way.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:84%
However, I knew that the
culture itself doesn't really

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:90%
promote that.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So if my father doesn't
agree, still my uncle

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.060 align:middle line:84%
can convince him
because the culture

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:90%
is all about everybody else.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not one person ever.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It's always everybody
else making decisions.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're always doing because
you are worried about what

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:90%
other people are going to say.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you just
kept your nose clean,

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.680 align:middle line:90%
kept your nose in the books.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:90%
So you get married now.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And you come to
the United States

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:90%
and continue your education.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And you ended up in some
pretty fine schools.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But you also had some
pretty interesting jobs

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:84%
while you were learning
English, dry cleaning.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:84%
You were at a dry
cleaning place to start

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.400 align:middle line:90%
practicing your English.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So talk about what happened
coming from a upper middle-class

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:84%
family in Pakistan to a
teensy little apartment in LA

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.705 align:middle line:84%
with your new husband
and no English.

00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:01.432 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Exactly.

00:22:01.432 --> 00:22:03.140 align:middle line:84%
It was quite a rude
awakening, let's just

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:84%
say, because all my life, I was
raised with Bollywood movies

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
where there is this incredible
actor like Shah Rukh Khan

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:90%
and Aamir Khan.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And people who
watch the Bollywood,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.992 align:middle line:90%
they will know what I'm saying.

00:22:12.992 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And they are always doing
everything for the girls.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And the whole love
story is always

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.195 align:middle line:84%
like, girls don't
do mostly nothing.

00:22:19.195 --> 00:22:20.570 align:middle line:84%
They just have to
look beautiful.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And the rest happens because
the guy is falling for them.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:84%
They're going to do
everything for them.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:90%
So no matter what--

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who doesn't like
such a nice love story?

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So to some extent,
we're all programmed

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:84%
into believing that
when you get married,

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.163 align:middle line:84%
the man is going to be
the love of your life.

00:22:35.163 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be the
most incredible life.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was under that
exact same impression.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But my entire fairy tale
broke on the wedding

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:45.655 align:middle line:84%
night when I learned that he
was in love with someone else.

00:22:45.655 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:90%
And then, of course--

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't want
to have to marry you.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to marry this--
be with this other person.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Exactly.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:84%
That to me was
like, right there,

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:84%
it started breaking
apart for me,

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and then the very fact that
even when I come to America

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and come to the
studio apartment and I

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
see how the house doesn't
even have any space for me.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:84%
It was just more like--
it was more like the

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
more and more I was realizing
that how far away I am from all

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:90%
the people who loved me.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm with
this strange man

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know for
the rest of my life.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Because as a good
Muslim girl, I'm

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.115 align:middle line:84%
supposed to stay
with him until I die.

00:23:22.115 --> 00:23:23.875 align:middle line:90%
It was a huge, rude awakening.

00:23:23.875 --> 00:23:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And then knowing
that he didn't even

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:84%
have any money to afford
my own ticket, all of that

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:84%
just completely
put me in a place

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.630 align:middle line:84%
where it was all like
I was fully cast away,

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.305 align:middle line:90%
Tom Hanks survival mode.

00:23:34.305 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Cast away.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:90%
You have your volleyball.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.126 align:middle line:90%
Who was your volleyball?

00:23:40.126 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: That's true.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your education
was your volleyball.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.715 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: I was
looking for Wilson.

00:23:43.715 --> 00:23:45.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
were looking for Wilson.

00:23:45.548 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you ended
up-- ultimately,

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.320 align:middle line:84%
you ended up learning
to speak English.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, did you have kids
when you went to school,

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:90%
when you were at UC Irvine?

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.003 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: No, actually.

00:23:55.003 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:90%
That was the one good thing.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I have to thank my husband for
that because he was very smart.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:10%
He knew that I was already
handling a lot of variables

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.460 align:middle line:10%
in the equation.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:10%
I was like ready
to dive into kids

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.880 align:middle line:10%
because I was also programmed
that when you get married,

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:10%
everybody is asking you,
when are you having kids?

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you have a
physical problem if you're not

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.355 align:middle line:90%
making babies right away.

00:24:13.355 --> 00:24:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're supposed to actually
mate on the wedding night

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and supposed to get
pregnant on the same night.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the expectation.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So the very fact that I
didn't do any of that,

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I was already not
fulfilling the requirement.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.645 align:middle line:84%
So I was worried about
being a good Muslim girl--

00:24:27.645 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And wife and mother.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: --and everything else.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:90%
So for me, that was the goal.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But then my first
husband told me

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:84%
that I prefer that you
get your education done,

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.620 align:middle line:90%
you get your degree.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.730 align:middle line:90%
So I had to respect that.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So I did it out of
following my husband

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.475 align:middle line:90%
as a good, obedient wife.

00:24:43.475 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad
that he did that.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:45.767 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, so glad.

00:24:45.767 --> 00:24:47.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really, that was a gift.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: That was a gift.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.052 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was grace.

00:24:49.052 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:90%
UC, really good school.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.602 align:middle line:84%
And you ended up--
you were quite smart.

00:24:52.602 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you got your degree in
two and a half years, right?

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yes.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:56.412 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In engineering?

00:24:56.412 --> 00:25:00.638 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Yes, and taught by
a Chinese professor, who

00:25:00.638 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:90%
were not speaking good English.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
was pretty amazing.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, you got a job
at Hughes Aeronautics,

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.438 align:middle line:84%
went on to Boeing,
also ended up at NASA.

00:25:08.438 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about that in a bit.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.740 align:middle line:84%
But along the way,
you had two children,

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.105 align:middle line:90%
one had some disability.

00:25:14.105 --> 00:25:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And so you had that going
on in your life, which is--

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and you were working,
I assume, and trying

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.750 align:middle line:84%
to learn to cook and do these
things a good wife does.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:27.378 align:middle line:84%
And then of all the good luck,
your mother-in-law moves in.

00:25:27.378 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Oh, goodness.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.733 align:middle line:84%
It's like if things
couldn't have gotten harder,

00:25:32.733 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:84%
they became harder because
you couldn't really

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:90%
please her, right?

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Right.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was the thing that
mother-in-law actually moved in.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Mainly the goal was
to get a lot of help

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:84%
from her because that's
also a cultural mindset

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:84%
because generally, nobody
raises their own children.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole culture,
the whole family,

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.920 align:middle line:90%
the extended family raises.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So my husband actually
thought that it's good to have

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.480 align:middle line:90%
a mother-in-law who basically--

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, his mother, of course.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coming
from the right place.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Coming from the
right place and all of that.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And then generally, that's how
it is because they are also

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.072 align:middle line:90%
well taken care of.

00:26:03.072 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
also reciprocating

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.098 align:middle line:90%
by taking care of your children.

00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just in my case,
the biggest challenge

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:13.530 align:middle line:84%
was that my husband and his
mom, they were a very good unit.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
They were so good unit that
it was a conflict of interest

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:84%
because when you are so
good with your mother, then

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.370 align:middle line:84%
you're not making any
decision with your partner.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And because of that and the
very fact that we were also

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:90%
very different belief system--

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I was not raised with
a religious mindset,

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:90%
but he was very religious.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So I actually became
more religious

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:84%
when I came to America,
which sounds very ironic.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:84%
While I was in Pakistan,
I had more freedom

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to religion
because of my dad

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
because he wasn't like
so hung up on all that.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But having the
mother-in-law and then

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.925 align:middle line:84%
having a husband who
travels all the time,

00:26:44.925 --> 00:26:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and then I felt like being
married to mother-in-law

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.880 align:middle line:84%
than the husband, all of that
created a lot of friction

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And then working full-time
and then fulfilling

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.540 align:middle line:84%
the expectation
of a mother-in-law

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:58.380 align:middle line:84%
expects a daughter-in-law to
be, a typical daughter-in-law, I

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.385 align:middle line:84%
mean, it's hard for that
person to be all of that.

00:27:01.385 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:90%
How can you do all of that?

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:84%
How can you be a homemaker
and also bring the income?

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Work at Boeing.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Exactly.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And my income was
similar to my husband.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.890 align:middle line:84%
However, the respect
wasn't given the same.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it was just
multiplying, multiplying

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.610 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
when I had two kids,

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:84%
it became very prominent
to me that I wasn't

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:90%
very happy in the marriage.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.820 align:middle line:90%
And I needed some change.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.727 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the whole
world came to stop me.

00:27:27.727 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:84%
My parents came to stop me,
of course, my mother-in-law.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you can't
get divorced in that culture.

00:27:31.925 --> 00:27:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: No, not at all.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.338 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has ever done it.

00:27:34.338 --> 00:27:35.255 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's ever done it.

00:27:35.255 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But interestingly,
your dad, of all people,

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:90%
understood.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.140 align:middle line:84%
He was the one when he came
and observed at close head

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and saw, his kind of a broken
heart that he had for you said,

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:90%
no, you can do this.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yeah.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.780 align:middle line:84%
That was actually--
I think there

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.210 align:middle line:84%
was a healing moment for
me because all my life,

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I actually didn't like how
my dad was with me, partly

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.630 align:middle line:84%
because he was so
angry at everyone.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.915 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't letting me
do what I wanted to do.

00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And it had nothing
to do with me.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:09.330 align:middle line:84%
It had everything to do with him
because everybody is projecting

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.010 align:middle line:90%
their own fear on you.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.160 align:middle line:90%
And that was the case.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But that, I think,
moment when he actually

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.550 align:middle line:90%
said that it doesn't matter--

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.060 align:middle line:84%
he said that I don't think I
can support you financially

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.220 align:middle line:84%
or I can support
you emotionally.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.485 align:middle line:90%
But I will approve--

00:28:22.485 --> 00:28:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to respect your
decision whether you stay

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:84%
or whether you don't,
because I've seen enough

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.602 align:middle line:84%
that I feel like that if this is
how you get treated while we are

00:28:30.602 --> 00:28:33.310 align:middle line:84%
here, we don't even know how you
get treated when we're not here.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And that to me right there
was the moment in my life

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that really like
a giant crossroad.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh my God, I was
so happy that my dad approved.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So you freed yourself
from the marriage.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And so your career, let's talk
a little bit about what you

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.830 align:middle line:90%
were particularly skilled in.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:56.300 align:middle line:84%
You were involved with
software development,

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:90%
as I recall in the book.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But explain to people
how it progressed

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.520 align:middle line:90%
in the aeronautics industry.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.320 align:middle line:90%
What was your role?

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: So basically,
as a bachelor--

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I have a bachelor in
electrical engineering.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But when I got
hired by the Hughes,

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:90%
it was a satellite phone.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking
for software engineer.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.730 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I wasn't
a software engineer.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:15.260 align:middle line:84%
But they said, well,
you're electrical engineer,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:90%
you can learn anything.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they taught me all
the programs that I had to use

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to code in Ada and C and
C++ and machine language.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it was
actually a perfect job for me

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:84%
because I was an electrical
engineer who learned

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.290 align:middle line:90%
how to be software engineer.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.520 align:middle line:84%
In that three year, I learned
the entire cradle-to-grave

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.610 align:middle line:90%
software life cycle.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:84%
I learned how the
bits and bytes makes

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.110 align:middle line:90%
anything happen in the world.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And that to me was
the best experience

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that I have to say,
thank you, Hughes,

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.330 align:middle line:90%
for giving me that experience.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.747 align:middle line:84%
But I also want to go a little
farther for everybody who's

00:29:46.747 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:84%
listening, is the reason I
got that experience because I

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.040 align:middle line:84%
was getting a-- it was very
hard for me to get an interview.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I was sending
hundreds and hundreds

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:84%
of resumes because of my name,
because my last name was not

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Soni.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.770 align:middle line:84%
It was Bandukwala, which
made it even harder.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.450 align:middle line:84%
When I would usually
get an interview,

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:03.740 align:middle line:90%
I would usually get a job.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.750 align:middle line:84%
But when I would get a job, I
was not gung ho about the job

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.600 align:middle line:90%
just because I got it.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:84%
In my heart, I knew
that there is a job

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to feel for.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And that job has
to line up with me.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So I actually waited
for the right job.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what triggered
me to always work

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.230 align:middle line:84%
on the state-of-the-art
programs.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And I have done that
pretty much all my life.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I've worked on programs that are
very unique and that are very--

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.200 align:middle line:90%
like to change technologically.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.460 align:middle line:90%
It's like a big milestone.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And that has been
my record, which

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.226 align:middle line:84%
is the reason I'm doing
what I'm doing now.

00:30:42.226 --> 00:30:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we
have a little insight

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:48.130 align:middle line:84%
into how your mind works,
how your spirit works.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.300 align:middle line:90%
You get divorced.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, ultimately, you
did remarry, right?

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yes.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
kids stayed with you.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:90%
The kids stayed with you.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately,
you ended up with NASA.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, how did that--

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Boeing, doing similar
things, software design

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:84%
for Boeing, software
engineering with Boeing.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.720 align:middle line:90%
And then you moved on to NASA.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about that
piece because that's always

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.080 align:middle line:90%
quite impressive.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.890 align:middle line:84%
You have to be pretty
darn smart to get there.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: So actually,
the interesting thing

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:84%
is that as soon as I left Hughes
and started working at Boeing,

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:84%
the first project was
International Space Station.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And that project was
directly with NASA.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.377 align:middle line:90%
So we were traveling to Houston.

00:31:26.377 --> 00:31:27.460 align:middle line:90%
We were working with them.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.835 align:middle line:84%
We were testing
all the computer.

00:31:28.835 --> 00:31:31.567 align:middle line:84%
So NASA was my customer
from that point on.

00:31:31.567 --> 00:31:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So I was already
interacting with NASA

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:84%
in that capacity as
a Boeing employee.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And for the most
part, I've worked

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:84%
on both commercial programs
and both secret programs

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.270 align:middle line:84%
where either my customer has
been NASA or Missile Defense

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Agency.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So that has been going
on for 20 odd years.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And then when I retired
from Boeing in 2018,

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I was attending a wedding
where one of the girls

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:90%
just liked my personality.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.790 align:middle line:90%
And she had a small company.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking for-
a fill in a role at NASA.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:90%
And I gave my resume.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And then it was interesting
because they had like five roles

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that I could do,
partly because I

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:84%
changed my role
every two and a half,

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.530 align:middle line:90%
three years in my industry.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.703 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I have
collected a lot--

00:32:11.703 --> 00:32:13.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Huge
experience background.

00:32:13.245 --> 00:32:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Huge experience.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.358 align:middle line:84%
So I could pretty
much do any role.

00:32:15.358 --> 00:32:18.020 align:middle line:84%
It's usually more like the
question is, do I want to do it?

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not, can I do it?

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.498 align:middle line:84%
It's more like, do
I want to do it?

00:32:20.498 --> 00:32:22.622 align:middle line:84%
So they had like three or
four roles on the table.

00:32:22.622 --> 00:32:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And there were like five
people interviewing me

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:25.458 align:middle line:90%
for different roles.

00:32:25.458 --> 00:32:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And they even told me
that with your resume

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and what you have
done, basically you

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.520 align:middle line:90%
choose what you want to do.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
they're choosing you,

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:90%
it's about your choosing them.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:34.640 align:middle line:90%
And I go.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I've picked
the job that I liked.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I picked the job
working on Falcon 9 rocket

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:84%
because I was very
intrigued about SpaceX.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:42.875 align:middle line:90%
And I was intrigued about--

00:32:42.875 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, so you
were involved in that?

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Yes, I was
involved in that.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:84%
That was my first
project with NASA,

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:84%
where I was actually a software
subject matter expert from NASA,

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.960 align:middle line:90%
verifying their software.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I skipped that
part or I missed it.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:59.655 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yeah, it was amazing--

00:32:59.655 --> 00:33:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
how was the-- how

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
did you find the technology
to be from this private space

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:90%
industry?

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was this kind of-- is
it out of the conceptual way

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.570 align:middle line:84%
of thinking when
everything is done

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:84%
through the government
and NASA and sanctioned,

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:84%
when you have some
guy that decides

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:84%
he's going to start
building rockets, Elon Musk?

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: It's a pattern
buster, let's just say.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I've been in so many
different companies.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I've changed jobs,
changed companies.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.040 align:middle line:84%
If anybody gets a chance to go
to SpaceX on Hawthorne Boulevard

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:84%
in California-- at least that's
where it's located until it

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.780 align:middle line:90%
moves to Texas--

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.060 align:middle line:90%
that place is out of this world.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that
I was blown away.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:40.770 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you
enter, first of all,

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you're
in a Star Trek world,

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%
partly like you are in
a different reality.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen an
aerospace company

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:50.260 align:middle line:84%
where half the people are on
skates, by the way, skateboards.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
go to the cafeteria,

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:84%
there is a whole different
music going on, all you can eat.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.630 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, you only
pay $5 for unlimited food

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and all you can
drink all the time.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.090 align:middle line:90%
There's no limits.

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:84%
At 8 o'clock people
are talking about--

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:84%
they're brainstorming at 8:00
PM at night because the life

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.510 align:middle line:84%
basically has no time
limits over there,

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.665 align:middle line:84%
because he has made like a
playground for engineers,

00:34:12.665 --> 00:34:15.040 align:middle line:84%
where all you can eat, all
you can drink is always there.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:15.734 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All you can think.

00:34:15.734 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: It's all there, too.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if he wants
it done at 2 in the morning,

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:21.108 align:middle line:84%
everyone jumps and does
it at 2 in the morning.

00:34:21.108 --> 00:34:23.471 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: So it's a very
smart way of creating this.

00:34:23.471 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:84%
I mean, technically,
you don't even

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.370 align:middle line:84%
have to tell people that
please work this many hours.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.789 align:middle line:84%
People are not going to go
home because it's so exciting.

00:34:30.789 --> 00:34:32.100 align:middle line:90%
And that to me was just--

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the technology,
the science behind it,

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:36.760 align:middle line:90%
the engineering was tight.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.880 align:middle line:90%
He had brilliant minds.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: 100% brilliant mind.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.679 align:middle line:90%
It almost feels like even--

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.760 align:middle line:84%
the other thing I noticed
when you go there,

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.550 align:middle line:90%
you don't see anybody--

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.840 align:middle line:90%
mostly people are in their 30s.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.969 align:middle line:84%
Mostly people are
actually in their 20s.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:90%
Some are in their 30s.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody above 40.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.072 align:middle line:90%
It looks like that you are--

00:34:53.072 --> 00:34:54.989 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, like
you're in a sci-fi movie

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:56.275 align:middle line:90%
where there's an age cut off.

00:34:56.275 --> 00:34:58.150 align:middle line:84%
All of these people are
brilliant, of course.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's like a
very different world

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.670 align:middle line:84%
compared to if you go to
any other industry, NASA,

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Lockheed Martin, Boeing.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere else you go, Hughes, is
just like more of a demographic.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.550 align:middle line:90%
There's a demographic.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
more spread out.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:84%
There, it was very,
very dominated,

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.090 align:middle line:90%
like all mostly in 30s--

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:16.132 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this is fun?

00:35:16.132 --> 00:35:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: It is definitely
fun, very vibrant energy.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.420 align:middle line:84%
People who are there,
they truly are there

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:26.160 align:middle line:84%
because that is pretty much
what they breathe every second.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was reading
Elon Musk's biography.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.720 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, I was
just blown away

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.420 align:middle line:10%
at what he was able
to gather together

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.760 align:middle line:10%
as a single person
with this will,

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:10%
like your will to transform
your life, with this will,

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:10%
we're doing it.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: That is exactly true.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.542 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with
NASA, you're there.

00:35:41.542 --> 00:35:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And you're verifying this.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things you told

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:84%
me is on different
shots that go out that--

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.900 align:middle line:84%
or you said in your book,
is that launches are often

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.260 align:middle line:90%
interfered with.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.127 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed this
back in disclosure.

00:35:55.127 --> 00:35:55.960 align:middle line:90%
This was brought up.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
this a little bit?

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yeah.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So as far as my
experience is concerned,

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.870 align:middle line:84%
when I was working on the
Ground Midcourse Defense.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we were
launching missiles.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:12.330 align:middle line:84%
That was the time when people
would come and confide in me

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.750 align:middle line:90%
that during the launch time--

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.130 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that I
already had observed myself

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:90%
was that the weather always--

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.950 align:middle line:84%
weather, of course,
changes within a day.

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.470 align:middle line:84%
We all see that, especially
living in a certain city,

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:24.580 align:middle line:90%
it changes drastically.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But there was something about
the weather changing within that

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:30.585 align:middle line:84%
three-hour window because the
weather can make a day or can--

00:36:30.585 --> 00:36:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cancel it.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Exactly, because weather
is a huge, huge pivotal point.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that I was not
aware of, which was brought

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.780 align:middle line:84%
to my attention by a
couple of colleagues--

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and they said it at a
different time frame--

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
was that they noticed a
craft during the launch time.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And the way the craft moved
is what they said that--

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you,
I wasn't smoking.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And these people
cannot smoke because--

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at Boeing,
I mean, you can't--

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.420 align:middle line:90%
it's completely forbidden.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But these people
are basically saying

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.680 align:middle line:84%
that they're seeing the
craft that moves at the speed

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.650 align:middle line:84%
that nothing we have
invented could move.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And then it was also
moving in directions

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.860 align:middle line:84%
that nothing we
invented can move.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't just the speed,
it was also the direction.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And those two
things, they noticed.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And they basically
completely felt

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.780 align:middle line:84%
like that they've
seen like a unicorn.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And they had to
express it to someone

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:24.270 align:middle line:84%
who's not going to judge
them and because I was always

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:29.040 align:middle line:84%
very open-minded about
expressing my things because I

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
never separated my spirituality
from them because I

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.850 align:middle line:84%
felt like I'm not-- like
there's nothing for me to hide.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Who I am is good
for me to share.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So I would share, which opened
them up to share these things

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.680 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
how did it work?

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.650 align:middle line:84%
You find that the weather
would very suddenly

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.930 align:middle line:84%
shift one way or another
to allow that launch

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:49.530 align:middle line:90%
to happen or not happen.

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So there was some force
watching over saying

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.100 align:middle line:90%
this isn't beneficial.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.947 align:middle line:84%
And whoever's opinion it was,
we're not going to allow it.

00:37:55.947 --> 00:37:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: That is very true.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I'm
going to interject

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.140 align:middle line:84%
my personal understanding
of technology.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.060 align:middle line:90%
So we have already--

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all know--

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I personally feel that
sci-fi is how I get my news.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Sci-fi is how I learn about
technology that's already

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.083 align:middle line:84%
happened because by the time it
makes sense it in sci-fi movie

00:38:12.083 --> 00:38:14.910 align:middle line:84%
generally, those
technology have been there.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And then when you watch
movies like Men in Black,

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.633 align:middle line:90%
you can erase memory.

00:38:19.633 --> 00:38:21.050 align:middle line:84%
But in Men in
Black, they actually

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:84%
show-- especially in
the part 3, they really

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.290 align:middle line:84%
show how they tinker
during the launches.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you really
think about that,

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.980 align:middle line:84%
if you have a technology
like a Looking Glass,

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.870 align:middle line:84%
you are able to-- like in
Tomorrow, George Clooney's

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
movie, they actually show this
whole thing, where they're

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.110 align:middle line:90%
continuously looking at this.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.360 align:middle line:90%
And they're putting the input.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.735 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeing exactly
what the future is projecting.

00:38:43.735 --> 00:38:45.277 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Project
Looking Glass, yep.

00:38:45.277 --> 00:38:46.077 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Exactly.

00:38:46.077 --> 00:38:48.768 align:middle line:84%
So when you have that type of
technology there, and especially

00:38:48.768 --> 00:38:50.310 align:middle line:84%
every time when you
launch a missile,

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:53.607 align:middle line:84%
you are really making a
very big ripple in timeline.

00:38:53.607 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
that in a moment.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:84%
For just a moment,
talk about that.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: So this goes to
the basic understanding

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.330 align:middle line:84%
of how everything
comes into existence.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is how I understand that
everything comes into existence

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.830 align:middle line:84%
following a
Mandelbrot set, which

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:13.310 align:middle line:84%
is how the holographic
matrix gets formed

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:14.970 align:middle line:90%
based on the fractal equation.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.620 align:middle line:90%
The equation is very simple.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.415 align:middle line:84%
But what it creates
is very complex.

00:39:18.415 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So when you really
understand how

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:25.451 align:middle line:84%
everything comes into existence
following that and how--

00:39:25.451 --> 00:39:28.410 align:middle line:84%
anywhere you put a ripple,
put a pebble in the stone,

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.860 align:middle line:84%
it creates that quantum
field because it

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.010 align:middle line:84%
creates the constructive
field or destructive field

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.890 align:middle line:84%
depending on where it's
intersecting with each other.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And that has the
butterfly effect.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So the butterfly effect, ripple
effect, all of these things

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:45.410 align:middle line:90%
are--

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:46.440 align:middle line:90%
hundredth monkey effect.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.273 align:middle line:84%
All of these things are
actually telling you

00:39:48.273 --> 00:39:51.350 align:middle line:84%
the same thing, that every
single thing that we do

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.442 align:middle line:90%
affects everything else.

00:39:53.442 --> 00:39:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Because in the quantum field,
everything is interconnected.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have to really
accept the fact that we

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.810 align:middle line:90%
are an interconnected species.

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And we are not just
interconnected with the human,

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.910 align:middle line:84%
we are interconnected
with everything there is.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Us meeting today,
we have already

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.560 align:middle line:84%
opened up a whole new portal
in a timeline, so let's

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.418 align:middle line:90%
just cheers to that.

00:40:11.418 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cheers to that.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to have met you.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yes, same here.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:90%
So cheers to timeline.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there are
others watching over

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.600 align:middle line:84%
what would become a ripple
effect in the timeline

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.090 align:middle line:84%
if a launch were
allowed to proceed

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:28.215 align:middle line:90%
or whether it was thwarted.

00:40:28.215 --> 00:40:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: 100%.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:31.780 align:middle line:90%
It is a mega event.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And these events are going
to affect not just one

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.580 align:middle line:90%
family or two families.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:38.770 align:middle line:90%
It affects Earth as a planet.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It affects Earth relation with
everything else in a Milky Way.

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So every time when we're doing
anything at the level like that,

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:50.810 align:middle line:84%
we are truly going out in the
quantum field at the mega level.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And my understanding,
once we had the ability

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to use nuclear energy in terms
of our weaponry, that changed

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:01.140 align:middle line:84%
the whole game
because of the ripple

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.590 align:middle line:84%
effects throughout our cosmos,
our near neighbors and far away.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you see everything
in a quantum way

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and you use this and
harness it literally

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.100 align:middle line:84%
for the creation of your own
life and your own direction,

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe explain that to us
because a lot of people

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:84%
here have watched a
lot of my other videos

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.190 align:middle line:90%
on ufology and such.

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.630 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we're trying
to shoot something that's

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:24.280 align:middle line:84%
going to detonate in the
cosmos or on the moon,

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.020 align:middle line:84%
for example, as they attempted
to do when other beings are

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:28.960 align:middle line:90%
watching this?

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.120 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is
it's really not allowed.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Right.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So that is the thing, that
even when we watch "Star Trek"

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and there's a Galactic
Federation, there are rules.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.315 align:middle line:84%
So rules are set at a
different parameter.

00:41:40.315 --> 00:41:41.940 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
rules that we are not

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.500 align:middle line:84%
aware of because
we're not playing

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.690 align:middle line:84%
in the playground
at the level where

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:47.020 align:middle line:90%
we can understand the rules.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So everybody has to
operate off of some rule

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:51.580 align:middle line:84%
because people have
created those rules.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, there are rules
between human and other species.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that those
rules, when they get violated,

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:90%
it affects our reality on Earth.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that even
when we launch on the moon--

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and I know people question
about us launching on the moon,

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:09.130 align:middle line:84%
whether the video
was right or not,

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe that
we did launch on the moon.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean land
on the moon back then

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.880 align:middle line:84%
versus another time when
they tried to launch

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.170 align:middle line:90%
a nuclear weapon to the moon?

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.610 align:middle line:90%
That was stopped.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.935 align:middle line:90%
I saw the original video.

00:42:18.935 --> 00:42:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was
embedded in a program.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
thought it was fake video.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:22.830 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Oh, that's interesting.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So that part, I
actually didn't know.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.820 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, you're right.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.237 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the moon landing

00:42:27.237 --> 00:42:30.647 align:middle line:84%
because the moon landing was a
huge pivotal point in our lives.

00:42:30.647 --> 00:42:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
is very interesting

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:33.850 align:middle line:90%
is that what exactly happened?

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And what did we
breaks as a treaty?

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Or what ripple
effect did we create?

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:42.970 align:middle line:84%
None of us have that
level of information

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:84%
at our level to really
know what happened.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:48.165 align:middle line:84%
But the very fact that
now 50 years after--

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and then Donald
Trump actually is

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.060 align:middle line:84%
the reason we're having
this Artemis program.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.663 align:middle line:90%
He actually revived the program.

00:42:53.663 --> 00:42:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And the very fact that this
is all about going to the moon

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.930 align:middle line:84%
was very interesting that how
it almost jumpstarted that.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that it
jumpstarted it partly

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:05.000 align:middle line:84%
because not just human,
but other species,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.980 align:middle line:84%
everybody wants it because it
cannot be just us wanting it.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It has to be done at
the mega level for that

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:13.575 align:middle line:90%
to come into flourishment.

00:43:13.575 --> 00:43:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and some report
that others already are there,

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:19.690 align:middle line:84%
that structures
are already there

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:21.470 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the moon.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So talk about Artemis III a
bit because this is exciting.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.480 align:middle line:90%
You're still involved.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.560 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're under
security clearances.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And my audience is very
respectful of that.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:33.620 align:middle line:90%
And you can only say so much.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:37.560 align:middle line:84%
But where are we with
doing the moon again?

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So right now, so the
whole idea is that Artemis

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:42.280 align:middle line:90%
is the name of the program.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
about Artemis being--

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:47.103 align:middle line:84%
Artemis is the twin
sister of Apollo.

00:43:47.103 --> 00:43:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's like they're
kind of doing this.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Apollo was the mission where
we did the moon landing.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Now we're doing Artemis.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And the goal is the woman that
will walk on the moon first.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.810 align:middle line:90%
So that is another thing.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:58.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like a feminine
energy bringing back.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to the south side,

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.290 align:middle line:84%
or some people say
far side or dark side.

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:08.060 align:middle line:84%
All of that is the same word for
the same location on the moon,

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.420 align:middle line:84%
partly because it
is the site that we

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.510 align:middle line:90%
have learned that there is--

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:15.910 align:middle line:84%
under their shackle and
cradle, there is actually

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:18.640 align:middle line:90%
ice there and there is a--

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:84%
partly because that is the part
where sun ray doesn't get there.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there is ice there
that can be used as a way--

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.333 align:middle line:84%
as a starting point because
the goal is to go to the moon--

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
colonize ultimately.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Yes, by having a
water and fuel because those

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.800 align:middle line:84%
are the basic
things that you need

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to evolve and survive and also
go and traverse to other places.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So basically, moon
becomes a layover space

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:90%
to go to other places.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Right now, International
Space Station is.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But the goal is to make
moon as a layover space.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.510 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:51.454 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it's all about.

00:44:51.454 --> 00:44:53.246 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Elon Musk
says, why not Mars?

00:44:53.246 --> 00:44:54.700 align:middle line:90%
He's going to do it on Mars.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.565 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Mars is
actually his goal.

00:44:56.565 --> 00:44:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: And that moon is more
like you have to go through moon

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.610 align:middle line:90%
to get to Mars.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:01.652 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To get to Mars.

00:45:01.652 --> 00:45:04.040 align:middle line:90%
So NASA's going to the moon.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.350 align:middle line:84%
They want to start
colonization on the moon.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:07.600 align:middle line:90%
He thinks it's only--

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course,
estimates like these

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.660 align:middle line:84%
can be far off or
not so far off.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But he thinks maybe even another
dozen years, he can get to Mars.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And that we can
start colonizing.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Other people from the
military, from stories

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:21.570 align:middle line:84%
way back say we've
already been there.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.360 align:middle line:84%
There's already
underground structure

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.600 align:middle line:90%
that's been built there.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So the truth is
somewhere in there.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And who knows, maybe we're
looking at parallel timelines

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.060 align:middle line:90%
for the moon.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Once we start understanding
that all of these things

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.040 align:middle line:84%
are simultaneously
possible, the point

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.443 align:middle line:84%
is, we're going to the moon,
probably going to colonize,

00:45:39.443 --> 00:45:42.110 align:middle line:84%
going to Mars, probably going to
colonize if we haven't already.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: That is true.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.710 align:middle line:10%
And the one good thing
about all of this

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:49.020 align:middle line:10%
is that it's going to-- if you
do it in this physical reality,

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:51.890 align:middle line:10%
live on the moon, live on a
Mars like a sci-fi expanse

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:53.923 align:middle line:10%
show, which shows that
there is a Mars base,

00:45:53.923 --> 00:45:55.590 align:middle line:10%
there's a moon base,
there's Earth base.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:56.757 align:middle line:90%
People are going everywhere.

00:45:56.757 --> 00:45:58.325 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of like--

00:45:58.325 --> 00:46:00.270 align:middle line:84%
just like you go from
here to Pakistan,

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:02.060 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go
from here to Mars.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It will become that
type of reality.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.080 align:middle line:90%
And my whole thing is that--

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.970 align:middle line:84%
sometime people
are like, why are

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:10.250 align:middle line:84%
we spending all their
energy doing all that

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:11.580 align:middle line:90%
and not staying on Earth.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.090 align:middle line:84%
My whole thing is that
we are here to evolve.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:17.900 align:middle line:10%
And evolution needs
us to take the step

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.690 align:middle line:10%
in directions that are not very
comfortable, that are not easy.

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:23.900 align:middle line:10%
And every single time
we have made an attempt

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.887 align:middle line:10%
to do these things, we have
opened the door to timelines

00:46:26.887 --> 00:46:29.220 align:middle line:10%
that we didn't even know that
they were available to us.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And as Elon has stated
over and over again,

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.630 align:middle line:90%
he says, I'm just so--

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.770 align:middle line:84%
he's intrigued with
human consciousness.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:41.480 align:middle line:84%
He thinks human consciousness is
this vital, beautiful thing that

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:46.280 align:middle line:84%
must be able to project itself
beyond just a one planet

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.220 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.500 align:middle line:84%
He wants to see humanity's
consciousness seeds

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.290 align:middle line:84%
spread about in other places
so that no matter what

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.450 align:middle line:84%
happens in any one place,
our consciousness survives.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:58.672 align:middle line:90%
He says that's his goal.

00:46:58.672 --> 00:47:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Yeah, and I think that I
completely 100% agree with that.

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:01.932 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do.

00:47:01.932 --> 00:47:04.432 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: And the very fact that
it also opens the door for us

00:47:04.432 --> 00:47:06.530 align:middle line:84%
to have many ways
to exist, many ways

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to operate because we have
a lot of things going on

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:11.760 align:middle line:84%
on Earth right now like if
you take CERN, for example.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Everything that they're doing
with the Large Hadron Collider,

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:18.810 align:middle line:84%
they are truly perpetuating
into our reality.

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're dealing with
the Higgs field, when you're

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.810 align:middle line:84%
dealing with the
Higgs boson, that

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:29.440 align:middle line:84%
is directly responsible for
creating matter in our world.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you're tinkering
with the reality

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to recreate what happened
during the Big Bang.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So just imagine that technically
whatever they do over

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:84%
there can have a cascading
effect on everyone's reality.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Then all the other
technology, like CRISPR, AI,

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:49.928 align:middle line:84%
all of these technology is like
tinkering at the level that

00:47:49.928 --> 00:47:51.095 align:middle line:90%
is beyond our comprehension.

00:47:51.095 --> 00:47:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we haven't even
gotten into the subject

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:58.297 align:middle line:84%
of how AI interfaces
with all of this,

00:47:58.297 --> 00:48:00.380 align:middle line:84%
which actually can be
another conversation for us,

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.170 align:middle line:90%
if you'd like.

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:02.566 align:middle line:84%
>>SONI: Yes, I'm
definitely game for that.

00:48:02.566 --> 00:48:04.024 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
as for you, you're

00:48:04.024 --> 00:48:07.010 align:middle line:84%
living proof about the concepts
we talk about all the time,

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that where you place your
passion, your desire,

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.700 align:middle line:84%
your excitement, energy,
time, your next thought is

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.510 align:middle line:90%
what you become.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And look what you've
become after a life that

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:19.320 align:middle line:84%
appeared to have so few
possibilities because you

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.120 align:middle line:90%
were innately that.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And you came to express
that and share that with us.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yes, thank you so much.

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you're right.

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fact that
I'm here experiencing you

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:30.680 align:middle line:84%
guys, experiencing this entire
magical experience that, thanks

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.860 align:middle line:84%
to you, I ended up
having, being in Boulder,

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.580 align:middle line:84%
that, to me, is a pivotal point
in my life from where I stand.

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Because when I look at my
reality growing up in Karachi,

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.000 align:middle line:84%
always covered up, always
worried that somebody will throw

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.650 align:middle line:84%
some sort of remarks at
me that will mess me up--

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:48.080 align:middle line:90%
or like it was a very--

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.090 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like you're
always contracting.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:52.250 align:middle line:90%
You're not expanding.

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:53.877 align:middle line:90%
That is the reality you're in.

00:48:53.877 --> 00:48:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you come
to the point in life

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.763 align:middle line:84%
where you feel like, you
know what, sky has no limit.

00:48:57.763 --> 00:48:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, now
you're like the sun.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:02.250 align:middle line:84%
You're just radiating
light and possibility.

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:03.330 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.750 align:middle line:90%
It's been so interesting.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much for
sharing your story, including

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.150 align:middle line:84%
some of the challenging
and vulnerable parts of it,

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and also for showing
us what's possible

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.710 align:middle line:90%
for every one of us who--

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:18.442 align:middle line:84%
we don't have reason to feel
the same constriction here,

00:49:18.442 --> 00:49:19.525 align:middle line:90%
but we do it to ourselves.

00:49:19.525 --> 00:49:20.608 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: That is very true.

00:49:20.608 --> 00:49:21.408 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:21.408 --> 00:49:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like to continue
this conversation with you

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.390 align:middle line:84%
another time and go
into the effects of,

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:29.480 align:middle line:84%
how this is going to work out
with our consciousness and AI

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and the creation of these
other timelines and realities

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:35.370 align:middle line:90%
as you see it.

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: I would love that.

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:38.372 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that would
be a fun conversation.

00:49:38.372 --> 00:49:40.770 align:middle line:84%
This one was just a meet
and greet, get to know you.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SONI: Yes, and I'm just--

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:45.008 align:middle line:84%
it has been fun getting
to know you briefly, too.

00:49:45.008 --> 00:49:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank you.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.090 align:middle line:90%
Shehnaz.

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:50.250 align:middle line:10%
The title of Shehnaz book
is The Quantum Being,

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:51.840 align:middle line:10%
which you can find on Amazon.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.490 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely fascinating read.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And her life alone, no
less the rest of it.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
