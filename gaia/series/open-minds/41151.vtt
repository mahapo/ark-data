>> Regina Meredith: Many

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:30.764 align:middle line:84%
of you may have seen Dane
Wigington featured in the film

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.532 align:middle line:84%
"Why in the World
are They Spraying?"

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.635 align:middle line:84%
For over a decade, he's been a
leader in uncovering the effects

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.705 align:middle line:84%
of geoengineering,
specifically chemtrails.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.374 align:middle line:84%
When I saw a recent
presentation of his on YouTube,

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.143 align:middle line:84%
I realized I was viewing
the most complete assessment

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.112 align:middle line:84%
of the subject I had
ever encountered.

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:48.115 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing more pressing
to humanity than to understand

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:52.185 align:middle line:84%
and find a way to stop
this devastating practice.

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.921 align:middle line:84%
We have Dane with
us today via Skype.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:55.755 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dane.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Dane Wigington: Thank you.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
It's refreshing on my end
to have media that's willing

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.797 align:middle line:84%
to cover this from an objective
standpoint because so far

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
to date we've had mainstream
media do everything they can

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.369 align:middle line:84%
to help to hide this
issue and at great cost

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:11.872 align:middle line:90%
to themselves as well.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:15.175 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the objective
coverage is greatly appreciated,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.676 align:middle line:90%
Regina.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.979 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You know, let's
just take a minute or so to get

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.148 align:middle line:84%
into a little bit of your
own back story in terms

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:25.185 align:middle line:84%
of you're involved with
solar and you were noticing

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:29.289 align:middle line:84%
that the capacity of the panels
and such were being compromised

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.159 align:middle line:84%
because of the nature of the
chemtrails obscuring the sun.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.562 align:middle line:84%
Can you get into that just a
little bit so we know a bit

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.664 align:middle line:90%
about how you started on this?

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Well, I grew
up in Southern California

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:43.336 align:middle line:84%
where the smog was absolutely
horrific and trying to get away

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
from that my whole life when I
came to the Pacific Northwest

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and moved into a very
remote area expecting

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.678 align:middle line:90%
to have clean air, clear skies.

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:54.047 align:middle line:84%
And having a background
in solar,

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.149 align:middle line:84%
I built a very large
off-grid home, was the cover

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.351 align:middle line:84%
of the rural-- the largest
renewal energy magazine

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:00.687 align:middle line:90%
Home Power.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:04.324 align:middle line:84%
But as I got-- set them up
and functioning and I began

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:07.993 align:middle line:84%
to lose 60-- 70 to 80 percent of
my solar uptake on certain days

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:10.163 align:middle line:84%
when these grid patterns were
there and clearly some sort

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:11.431 align:middle line:90%
of experimentation was going on.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So, that's what started
my study.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.169 align:middle line:90%
I'd already studied meteorology

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.906 align:middle line:84%
for about the five previous
years, so this dovetailed in

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.142 align:middle line:84%
and quickly came to the
subject of geoengineering

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.412 align:middle line:84%
and was astounded at the
amount of data that was there

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:28.081 align:middle line:84%
that I had not seen and
I-- to corroborate this,

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.751 align:middle line:84%
I began to do water testing
at the state's certified lab

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and was absolutely
shocked at the amount

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.723 align:middle line:84%
of heavy metal showing
up in my precipitation,

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:39.159 align:middle line:84%
matched the patents
exactly, you know,

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.627 align:middle line:84%
and I've been at
this ever since.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:41.761 align:middle line:90%
My life has been on hold ever

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.797 align:middle line:84%
since trying to expose
this issue.

00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:46.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You were just
talking about a little bit ago

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.202 align:middle line:84%
about meteorology and I
think one of the first things

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:52.605 align:middle line:84%
that comes up when anybody
starts examining this issue is

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.808 align:middle line:90%
why are we not hearing about it?

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:56.309 align:middle line:90%
You can look up in the sky

00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and see how your entire city
is obscured with these lines

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that tend to fluff out until
you have a total cloud cover.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.752 align:middle line:84%
But you don't hear
anything at all about it

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.954 align:middle line:90%
on the nightly weather news.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:09.623 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk about
what the agenda is

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
with the US Weather Service
and with the Weather Channel

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.264 align:middle line:84%
and some of that so we at least
know why we're not hearing

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:18.565 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:19.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: This is
what's most perplexing

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.235 align:middle line:84%
to many people is
that they feel somehow

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.137 align:middle line:84%
if this were really
a valid issue

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.505 align:middle line:90%
that it would be being told.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.107 align:middle line:84%
But I think we have
enough examples now to know

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:29.776 align:middle line:84%
that the system is in so
many arenas designed not

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.745 align:middle line:90%
to show what's truly happening.

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:34.881 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of the National
Weather Service and NOAA,

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.516 align:middle line:84%
the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration,

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:39.052 align:middle line:84%
their modeling is
done by Raytheon.

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:42.656 align:middle line:84%
Raytheon is up to their eyes
in these weather mod programs.

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:45.792 align:middle line:84%
So you literally have the
foxes running the henhouse.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.128 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
meteorologists,

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:51.798 align:middle line:84%
we had direct communication
with one Fox meteorologist

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:53.333 align:middle line:84%
who told us off the record
that they're being taken

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:57.437 align:middle line:84%
into meetings and told that they
are not to touch this issue.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.773 align:middle line:90%
So, when we see Weather Channel

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:03.743 align:middle line:84%
that now we know has a
Rothschild's ownership,

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.812 align:middle line:84%
Weather Central or Weather
Underground as well,

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.947 align:middle line:90%
the message-- it's essential

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.516 align:middle line:84%
that the people behind the
geoengineering control the

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:12.952 align:middle line:84%
message because otherwise events
that are completely unnatural,

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:16.189 align:middle line:84%
as events we see in increasing
intensity, these fluctuations

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:20.759 align:middle line:84%
of weather, 50, 60-degree
changes in one day.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:25.265 align:middle line:84%
The goal of those now
administering these weather

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:29.936 align:middle line:84%
dissemination agencies like
Weather Channel is to try

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.204 align:middle line:84%
to make again the
unnatural see natural.

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:35.041 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
are very visibly doing.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.979 align:middle line:84%
So, any notion that we're
going to be told the truth

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:45.085 align:middle line:84%
by mainstream media and their
various agencies is just simply

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:46.152 align:middle line:90%
not true.

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.854 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
enough examples now

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.356 align:middle line:84%
with the American public just
start to wake up to the fact

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:51.358 align:middle line:84%
that the message is being
controlled from top to bottom.

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.226 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, you would
think that since we're able

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:56.162 align:middle line:84%
to create the weather
and create the message,

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:58.598 align:middle line:84%
we'd have a much higher
degree of accuracy

00:04:58.598 --> 00:05:01.301 align:middle line:84%
in our nightly weathercast,
one would think.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:06.506 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: It's-- you
know, it's such an inaccurate

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:11.778 align:middle line:84%
and chaotic science to
try to control systems

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:13.079 align:middle line:90%
like the weather systems.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.881 align:middle line:84%
So now we have weather
whack-a-mole occurring

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:17.584 align:middle line:84%
and you have forecast
changing radically day to day

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:19.819 align:middle line:84%
and certainly when
you have perhaps--

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.454 align:middle line:84%
you have the system trying
to force back, you know,

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
the climate system
is being forced.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.594 align:middle line:84%
This is the meteorological
term, so the heart

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:30.096 align:middle line:90%
of the system gets forced

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:32.966 align:middle line:84%
by these programs the harder
it tries to push back.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.101 align:middle line:84%
So-- and now we're
at the point--

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.504 align:middle line:84%
this is so advanced and these
programs have gone so long

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.806 align:middle line:84%
that the system is
starting to fray apart.

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:42.709 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing the
geoengineers seem to know how

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:46.012 align:middle line:84%
to do is to-- if
beating your head

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.815 align:middle line:84%
against the wall is
starting to hurt,

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.216 align:middle line:90%
you just have to beat it harder.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.051 align:middle line:84%
And that's all they
how to do is increase

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:54.888 align:middle line:84%
in intensity what they've
already done no matter how much

00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:56.056 align:middle line:90%
destruction it causes.

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.725 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how much they
try to obscure the message,

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and they have changed
the languaging

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.028 align:middle line:90%
in our reports as well.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about this in
your presentation, which again,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I encourage everybody to look
at because we can only go

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.302 align:middle line:84%
into a small part of what
you talk about today.

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:13.006 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, this
is not something that--

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:15.108 align:middle line:84%
I mean it is public
knowledge in a sense.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:17.944 align:middle line:84%
There are congressional
committee hearings on this.

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:19.579 align:middle line:84%
I mean this has been going
on for a number of years.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:23.383 align:middle line:84%
There are meetings
with geoengineers

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.619 align:middle line:84%
that are interacting with the
government trying to decide how

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.688 align:middle line:90%
to best use this technology.

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:31.156 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that is conspiracy theory.

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:32.492 align:middle line:84%
We need to get that on
the table right off.

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.726 align:middle line:90%
This is a fact.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:36.629 align:middle line:84%
All of this you're
talking about is fact.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:37.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: This
is absolute fact.

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:39.432 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, we
have video footage

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:44.204 align:middle line:84%
of these tankers spraying
at altitude up close behind.

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:49.242 align:middle line:84%
We have many, many reels of
these so there is no debate.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:49.976 align:middle line:90%
There's no dispute.

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:51.411 align:middle line:90%
This is not a theory.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.712 align:middle line:90%
It's not conjecture.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.781 align:middle line:84%
These programs are going
on, plain and simple.

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:58.451 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who truly does
any investigation will get

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.019 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom of this.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.354 align:middle line:84%
And it's the biggest elephant
in plain sight in human history.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:05.024 align:middle line:84%
So we have-- going all
the way back to the 60s,

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.793 align:middle line:84%
documents I found in
the NASA archives,

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:09.295 align:middle line:84%
80-pages long outlining
the US weather--

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:11.498 align:middle line:84%
their mod programs as of
the mid-60s, with budgets

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:14.801 align:middle line:84%
in the hundreds of millions
of dollars even then.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.937 align:middle line:84%
And you had universities
involved for service,

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:21.107 align:middle line:84%
Department of Energy, I mean,
these documents we had posted.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.676 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is
not some secret.

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.845 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people can
investigate this,

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:27.914 align:middle line:84%
but the bottom line is
people have been trained

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:29.516 align:middle line:90%
as you alluded to earlier.

00:07:29.516 --> 00:07:32.018 align:middle line:84%
They have been trained to
accept certain things as normal.

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:33.987 align:middle line:84%
They have been trained
to accept certain terms

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:35.455 align:middle line:90%
as normal meteorologically.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So when the weather channel
comes out with a new term,

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.492 align:middle line:84%
for example heavy,
wet snow, and they try

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:43.963 align:middle line:84%
to explain how it can snow at 45
degrees, which can only be done

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:46.833 align:middle line:84%
with artificial ice nucleation,
so then you have people starting

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.635 align:middle line:84%
to accept this because
there's a term for it

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:90%
so it must be natural and--

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:84%
People need to break out
of this sort of programming

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.608 align:middle line:84%
because the weather
is completely hijacked

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.644 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.479 align:middle line:84%
There is no natural weather,
and this 50, 60-degree swings

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.348 align:middle line:84%
in temperature should be a
big glaring red flag to people

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:04.984 align:middle line:84%
that the train is very
seriously off the rails.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.152 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.087 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about
the hijackers.

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:10.356 align:middle line:90%
You already mentioned Raytheon.

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:12.659 align:middle line:84%
We've already talked about
the implication in the media.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.928 align:middle line:90%
Let's go further into it.

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:16.429 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about DoD.

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.431 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about DARPA.

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.999 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about HAARP.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:23.469 align:middle line:84%
And if this is the political end
of this before we start going

00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:25.171 align:middle line:84%
into the actual effects
of the chemtrails,

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.574 align:middle line:84%
but just so we have the stage
set for the players involved

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:31.411 align:middle line:84%
in this, how does the Department
of Defense and DARPA end

00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:33.746 align:middle line:84%
up in this story, which
also would drag in HAARP.

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:35.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: What's
the question, Regina,

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:37.983 align:middle line:84%
that people ask always, why
would they want to do this,

00:08:37.983 --> 00:08:41.154 align:middle line:84%
but that question
should be fairly clear.

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:45.191 align:middle line:84%
To control the weather is
to control the population

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.794 align:middle line:84%
and weather as a weapon
has always been sought

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle line:84%
after by militaries going
back many, many decades,

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:52.765 align:middle line:90%
even prior to World War II.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:57.236 align:middle line:84%
So this weather warfare
is certainly a weapon

00:08:57.236 --> 00:09:00.473 align:middle line:84%
of choice then you can
wreak havoc with an enemy

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:03.276 align:middle line:90%
without even firing a shot.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:04.677 align:middle line:84%
And so we appear to
have many examples

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:07.714 align:middle line:84%
of weather warfare
even in recent years.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:12.986 align:middle line:84%
We have-- in 2010, when Pakistan
showed resistance to US policy,

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:14.687 align:middle line:84%
they almost immediately
found 20 percent

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.155 align:middle line:90%
of their country under water.

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:19.826 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Thailand who
refused the USN air base,

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:22.195 align:middle line:84%
they found their country
under record flooding.

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:24.631 align:middle line:84%
We have US occupations
that occur immediately

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.232 align:middle line:84%
after very anomalous
weather events.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.302 align:middle line:84%
Haiti was one, and most
recently we have hurricane

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:31.237 align:middle line:84%
or cyclone Haiyan
in the Philippines.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:35.074 align:middle line:84%
Now, that cyclone, very
anomalously increased radically

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.576 align:middle line:84%
in intensity right
before it hit.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.612 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have a US increasing
occupation there as a result

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:45.218 align:middle line:84%
of that and that occupation was
sought before that cyclone hit.

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:49.455 align:middle line:84%
So, again we have-- and
meteorologically speaking,

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:51.691 align:middle line:84%
the degree which that
cyclone intensified just prior

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:90%
to impact was astounding.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.329 align:middle line:84%
And to add more to
that equation,

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:59.599 align:middle line:84%
we know the US has the
ability to suppress cyclones.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.702 align:middle line:84%
So at minimum we can say that
cyclone was not suppressed.

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:04.704 align:middle line:90%
And if people haven't wondered,

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:07.307 align:middle line:84%
they should why there's
no cyclones

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:10.343 align:middle line:84%
in the Atlantic basin
since 2005-2006.

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:14.881 align:middle line:84%
And even the Discovery Channel
admitted the US had started

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:16.215 align:middle line:84%
their hurricane suppression
program

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:17.817 align:middle line:84%
after the devastating
'05-'06 years.

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:21.321 align:middle line:84%
So why would they not
want cyclones in the US?

00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:22.855 align:middle line:84%
Obviously for the damage and
they've clearly suppressed them

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:25.625 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want anything
churning up the Gulf of Mexico

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.227 align:middle line:84%
where there's a sea of
oil sitting at the bottom.

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:29.762 align:middle line:84%
These reasons are quite
obvious if people start

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:33.099 align:middle line:84%
to really abandon
their preconceptions

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:34.400 align:middle line:90%
and look at reality.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What you're
talking about whoever--

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:84%
the US in this case,
we're speaking of the US,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.407 align:middle line:90%
deems to be a foreign enemy.

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:44.877 align:middle line:84%
OK? And as dastardly as that is
in and of itself, we're talking

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:49.649 align:middle line:84%
about heavy domestic
implications.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:50.983 align:middle line:90%
We, the people appeared

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:53.619 align:middle line:84%
to be the enemy combatant
at the moment.

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
It's as though, you
know what I'm saying.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: Exactly right.

00:10:58.624 --> 00:10:59.926 align:middle line:90%
Now you're exactly right.

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:01.394 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- governments
have always sought

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.629 align:middle line:84%
to control their populations
and what more covert

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:06.299 align:middle line:84%
and effective way to control
populations than to begin

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:10.136 align:middle line:84%
to control food supplies, to
create "natural disasters"

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:11.637 align:middle line:90%
that are anything but natural.

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:15.441 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, we
see events happening

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:19.045 align:middle line:84%
that are completely
modified weather.

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:21.013 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one after
another after another.

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:23.015 align:middle line:84%
This train of artificial
snowstorms is a very

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.484 align:middle line:90%
good example.

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:26.452 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if they have
one scheduled every week.

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:28.621 align:middle line:84%
And we see the setup for
these storms is very similar.

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:32.091 align:middle line:84%
Now our winter storms have
moisture coming straight

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:33.559 align:middle line:90%
out of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:36.763 align:middle line:84%
Now, since when did winter
storms have moisture coming

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:90%
out of the Gulf of Mexico?

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You're right.

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:41.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: So, it's a setup
almost the same every week.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.669 align:middle line:84%
You have Weather Channel
creating these theatrical names

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:47.073 align:middle line:84%
and they especially grabbed a
name that would get attention

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:51.244 align:middle line:84%
for the end of 2013, start
at 2014, hurricane or--

00:11:51.244 --> 00:11:53.479 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, winter
storm Hercules.

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:58.151 align:middle line:84%
So, you have this theater
occurring and being overblown

00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:01.788 align:middle line:84%
and these storms that
are being now sold to us

00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:04.157 align:middle line:84%
as having a warm
side and a cold side,

00:12:04.157 --> 00:12:08.394 align:middle line:84%
since when do winter storms
have tornadoes and thunderstorms

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.962 align:middle line:84%
on one side and you throw
a rock and you're in snow.

00:12:09.962 --> 00:12:11.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:13.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: And it's
important to remember,

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.967 align:middle line:84%
when they set these cold
temperatures, Regina,

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:20.406 align:middle line:84%
that that cold layer is in
many cases a very shallow layer

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.741 align:middle line:90%
on the surface.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.876 align:middle line:84%
So, when the ice nucleated
and it creates a colder layer

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:26.579 align:middle line:84%
and this chemical nucleation
is again how they're creating

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.980 align:middle line:90%
these snowstorms.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.317 align:middle line:84%
Those cold temperatures in many
cases as you go up an altitude--

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:32.618 align:middle line:84%
and you can talk
to people who fly

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:35.488 align:middle line:84%
to watch the temperature
monitor on the aircraft.

00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:37.824 align:middle line:84%
You can go up 2 or 3000 feet,
the temperature might go

00:12:37.824 --> 00:12:39.525 align:middle line:90%
up 30-40 degrees in some cases.

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:42.261 align:middle line:84%
So, this cold layer is
very deceptive to people

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.197 align:middle line:84%
and it's very effective
for headlines.

00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:47.633 align:middle line:84%
And these headlines help
to sell geoengineering.

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:48.835 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:50.269 align:middle line:84%
People wonder, has there
been a change in direction

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.572 align:middle line:84%
for the power structure
who is openly trying

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
to let us know the
planet was warming

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.074 align:middle line:90%
because they had an agenda?

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:56.309 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that was the case before.

00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:58.778 align:middle line:84%
Now, it appears they've
changed direction

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:03.149 align:middle line:84%
and they are absolutely trying
to hype the cold events created

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:06.118 align:middle line:84%
by geoengineering and we
believe that that helps them

00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:08.621 align:middle line:84%
to sell geoengineering to
leaders around the globe.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.691 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the
stated purpose is by 2025,

00:13:11.691 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:90%
to own the weather, right?

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: That's
a military document,

00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:16.996 align:middle line:90%
owning the weather and--

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:18.764 align:middle line:84%
whenever they set a date
on a document like that,

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:23.536 align:middle line:84%
you can bet that they are 15
to 20 years ahead of that date.

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:27.039 align:middle line:84%
So-- and owning the
weathers imply some sort

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:32.511 align:middle line:84%
of a precise control,
but any notion

00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:35.281 align:middle line:90%
that such systems could be truly

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:40.553 align:middle line:84%
"controlled" is a very
naive and reckless notion.

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:43.022 align:middle line:84%
And we see right now that they
are triggering feedback loop

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:45.191 align:middle line:90%
after feedback loop.

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:45.958 align:middle line:84%
And not to say that there
hasn't been anthropogenic damage

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.193 align:middle line:90%
to the planet.

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
There has and people
need to accept this.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.196 align:middle line:90%
It's not about Al Gore.

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:51.497 align:middle line:90%
It's about reality.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.999 align:middle line:84%
We've damaged the planet
from too many directions

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.234 align:middle line:90%
to even try to comprehend.

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:56.669 align:middle line:90%
But geoengineering appears

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:59.071 align:middle line:84%
to be the single greatest
climate disrupting factor

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:90%
of all right now.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, and in fact I
know how you feel about Al Gore.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:06.846 align:middle line:84%
And I happened, when
I was researching,

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.815 align:middle line:84%
to come across an interview,
a little clip from his sit

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:84%
down with Ellen DeGeneres
on her daytime talk show.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:90%
And even Al wasn't to praise--

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
was not praising the notion
of weather modification,

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.129 align:middle line:90%
the way we're going about it.

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:26.132 align:middle line:84%
So, and that-- at least for that
one minute in space and time,

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:28.968 align:middle line:84%
I think the two of you
had some agreement.

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:30.403 align:middle line:90%
It was really pretty comical.

00:14:30.403 --> 00:14:31.404 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: I thought
he looked a little

00:14:31.404 --> 00:14:32.371 align:middle line:90%
like a deer in the headlights.

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:33.306 align:middle line:90%
You know, when she asked.

00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: He did, he did.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.911 align:middle line:84%
He did. So, OK, now in terms
of again managing our ability

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:42.915 align:middle line:84%
to properly assess this
for ourselves, this is kind

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:44.417 align:middle line:84%
of the end of the
political aspect

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation before
we go into the effects of it.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.989 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things you
talked about is Wikipedia.

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:53.793 align:middle line:84%
If you go to Wikipedia, which
of course is now essentially the

00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:57.129 align:middle line:84%
Encyclopedia Britannica for
most people and you look

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:59.065 align:middle line:84%
at chemtrails, tell
us what you will find

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.567 align:middle line:84%
and what happens
if it's changed.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Well, this is
where semantics on this issue is

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
so important, and that's
why the name of our website,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.275 align:middle line:90%
GeoengineeringWatch.org,

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:10.977 align:middle line:84%
if people Google the
term geoengineering,

00:15:10.977 --> 00:15:12.078 align:middle line:90%
they come to hard science.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.846 align:middle line:84%
If they Google the
term chemtrails,

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:15.781 align:middle line:90%
they come to conspiracy theory.

00:15:15.781 --> 00:15:18.751 align:middle line:84%
And I have friends with the
Union of Concerned Scientists

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.886 align:middle line:84%
who have tried to clarify
that definition to try

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:24.123 align:middle line:84%
to make it known that
that is a layman's term

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:26.625 align:middle line:84%
for geoengineering,
climate engineering.

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Within minutes of trying
to clarify that definition,

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.366 align:middle line:90%
that definition is deleted.

00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:36.602 align:middle line:84%
So, these things are watched
quite closely, and again,

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.572 align:middle line:84%
we've tried to make people
understand semantics matter.

00:15:39.572 --> 00:15:42.074 align:middle line:84%
If you want to credibly
pass this data on,

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:43.476 align:middle line:90%
you must use science terms.

00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:45.378 align:middle line:84%
Geoengineering, climate
engineering,

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
if people Google those terms,
they'll find hard science.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now, so, Wikipedia
is not so democratic after all.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.184 align:middle line:90%
And now--

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:53.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: Not so much.

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:55.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- looking at it from
more of the scientific point

00:15:55.187 --> 00:15:57.123 align:middle line:84%
of view again, there are
over 150 patents you say

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.959 align:middle line:90%
for these types of technologies

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:03.329 align:middle line:84%
that aerosolize these heavy
metals into the atmosphere.

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:05.965 align:middle line:84%
This is a matter of
public record, right?

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: It is.

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:84%
We have these posted
on our site.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.835 align:middle line:90%
And again, there's patents

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:12.405 align:middle line:84%
for so many different
aspects of this.

00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:15.374 align:middle line:84%
You have everything
from a NASA patent,

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.076 align:middle line:84%
artificial ice nucleation
for weather modification,

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:19.011 align:middle line:90%
and we talked about that.

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:20.679 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's part
of the creation

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:22.214 align:middle line:90%
of the artificial snowstorms.

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:25.217 align:middle line:84%
And people have a hard time
believing that the weather is

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
that malleable, but
in fact it is.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:33.426 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the ability
the geoengineers have to push

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:35.661 align:middle line:84%
and pull the system
is quite astounding.

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So you have patents from
that to barium clouds,

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.999 align:middle line:90%
to a host of other issues.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And again, these patents
are all public record.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:84%
They're posted on
Geoengineering Watch.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Let's start talking

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:47.573 align:middle line:84%
about the implications
of living with this.

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:49.775 align:middle line:84%
We've been living with
them-- I mean, like I said,

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:52.411 align:middle line:84%
I started researching
them in 2000, 2001,

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:54.947 align:middle line:84%
very seriously researching,
calling everyday,

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:59.518 align:middle line:84%
calling the US Meteorological
Service, calling the FAA,

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:03.622 align:middle line:84%
getting due points, taking
pictures overhead, all of it,

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:05.091 align:middle line:90%
cross-referencing everything.

00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:06.392 align:middle line:90%
I was on this.

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:07.226 align:middle line:90%
No one paid attention.

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:09.028 align:middle line:90%
No one cared.

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.897 align:middle line:84%
Even Dennis Kucinich at
the time, I was present

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:14.166 align:middle line:84%
when he announced his first
run for the presidency

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:16.902 align:middle line:90%
at Marin County Civic Center.

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:20.139 align:middle line:84%
And the one question that
came up that he was clipped

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:84%
about is someone said, "Why is
it that you removed chemtrails

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.715 align:middle line:84%
from your ban on space-based
weapons bill," right?

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.251 align:middle line:84%
And he quickly said,
"If I didn't,

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:34.487 align:middle line:90%
everything else would go down.

00:17:34.487 --> 00:17:36.288 align:middle line:84%
Next?" And he wouldn't
talk about it.

00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:37.256 align:middle line:90%
He's not an easy man to scare.

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:39.158 align:middle line:90%
I consider him a brave man.

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:41.293 align:middle line:90%
And even he bailed on it then.

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:42.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: He did.

00:17:42.962 --> 00:17:44.196 align:middle line:90%
But I think we need

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:45.498 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
magnitude of this issue.

00:17:45.498 --> 00:17:48.334 align:middle line:84%
That's why I have
focused all on this issue.

00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:52.271 align:middle line:84%
Of all the challenges we faced,
short of nuclear catastrophe,

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:56.342 align:middle line:84%
which we obviously may face
now as well, the ramification

00:17:56.342 --> 00:18:00.246 align:middle line:84%
of geoengineering are
so dire and so extreme

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.848 align:middle line:84%
in every direction
that this is the issue

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:03.883 align:middle line:90%
that must be dealt with.

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:05.718 align:middle line:84%
This is the battle
that must be won.

00:18:05.718 --> 00:18:06.852 align:middle line:90%
So, obviously, they will go

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:09.021 align:middle line:84%
to great lengths
to hide this issue.

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:12.291 align:middle line:84%
And in Kucinich's case, I know
there was some speculation

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:15.027 align:middle line:84%
about the death of his
brother, was that--

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:15.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:18:15.995 --> 00:18:17.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: -- suspicious.

00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:19.732 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think we
can't even begin

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
threatened some

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
of these politicians might
be if they even begin

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.337 align:middle line:90%
to head in this direction.

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:26.705 align:middle line:90%
And we have examples too.

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:29.108 align:middle line:84%
If you remember when the
birds fell out of the sky,

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:29.975 align:middle line:90%
Regina, you remember that?

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:30.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, I do.

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.178 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:33.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: So, a lot of
people don't know that happened

00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:35.481 align:middle line:84%
in about 34 places around
the globe at the same time.

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:36.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:38.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: So, we had
John Wheeler, a Bush--

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:40.352 align:middle line:84%
former Bush aide seen
outside the Pentagon,

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:41.554 align:middle line:84%
according to reports,
saying he was going

00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:43.455 align:middle line:84%
to blow the whistle
on these programs.

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:45.391 align:middle line:84%
He was found at a
landfill two days later.

00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:49.762 align:middle line:84%
So, I don't think it's
at all speculative

00:18:49.762 --> 00:18:54.066 align:middle line:84%
to understand the type of
people we're dealing with here

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:56.702 align:middle line:84%
and the degree they will go
to to keep these programs

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:59.838 align:middle line:90%
from reaching the public eye.

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:01.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:06.111 align:middle line:84%
Let's go ahead and start looking
into some of the effects.

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:08.847 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of respect
for Dr. Russell Blaylock

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:11.016 align:middle line:84%
and I know you do as
well, and if you would

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:13.385 align:middle line:84%
like to just take some
time to explain to us some

00:19:13.385 --> 00:19:16.388 align:middle line:84%
of his findings that are
happening in the body,

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:20.059 align:middle line:84%
but even more so,
with the human brain.

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:23.662 align:middle line:84%
This-- and this also gets into
autism, all sorts of subjects.

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:24.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: It does.

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:26.332 align:middle line:84%
I have tremendous
regard for Dr. Blaylock.

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:28.834 align:middle line:84%
He has showed extreme
courage when so many

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:31.403 align:middle line:84%
of his colleagues
have shown none.

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:34.807 align:middle line:84%
And when we have people with
his credentials making clear the

00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:38.377 align:middle line:84%
effects of these materials,
everyone should take heed.

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:42.848 align:middle line:84%
So, the nanoparticulates we're
talking about are so small

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:45.517 align:middle line:84%
that they travel right
through the lung lining

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
into the bloodstream
where they are adhered

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.022 align:middle line:90%
to cell receptors like a plaque.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:55.261 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've also interviewed a
bioscientist, tenured professor

00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:84%
from Stanford on this
subject as well, at the effect

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.468 align:middle line:84%
of this plaque on our cell
receptors, and there is nothing

00:20:02.468 --> 00:20:04.737 align:middle line:84%
that it does not
negatively affect.

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:09.041 align:middle line:84%
And now Stanford Researchers are
also connecting this, you know,

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:12.244 align:middle line:84%
not only do we have ALS,
ADD, Alzheimer's, autism,

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:15.514 align:middle line:84%
the Stanford researchers
are connecting this aluminum

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:19.084 align:middle line:84%
exposure now to diabetes,
obesity.

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:22.788 align:middle line:84%
There's almost nothing
that the build

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:27.092 align:middle line:84%
of these bioavailable particular
it's don't do in our systems

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:29.595 align:middle line:84%
and I mean it's--
it's literally aside

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:32.531 align:middle line:84%
from these programs
ripping the climate apart,

00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:90%
devastating the ozone layer,

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.068 align:middle line:84%
thwarting the hydrological
cycle,

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:38.103 align:middle line:84%
toxifying everything
on the planet.

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
They are absolutely
positively killing us slowly,

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.443 align:middle line:84%
and that is not alarmism
or exaggeration.

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:46.845 align:middle line:84%
These materials are
building up in us

00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:48.414 align:middle line:84%
and we have enough
test now to show

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:50.582 align:middle line:84%
that there's virtually no one
in the population that's tested

00:20:50.582 --> 00:20:52.184 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't show signs of this.

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:53.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, I think one
of the potent scenes in "Why

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:56.355 align:middle line:90%
in the World are They Spraying?"

00:20:56.355 --> 00:21:01.493 align:middle line:84%
the version that Michael Murphy
was involved with was a family

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
of a little girl, I think she
was five years old in Hawaii.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.732 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you remember that part.

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:08.233 align:middle line:84%
She had been-- they
had moved there

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:10.202 align:middle line:84%
so they can have the cleanest
of air and water and soil

00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and grew their own foods and
she really led a pristine life.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.375 align:middle line:84%
And when they did hair
samples from that little girl,

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:19.044 align:middle line:90%
it was full of aluminum.

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:21.313 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know and
Blaylock talks about this.

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:24.717 align:middle line:84%
We know that aluminum also
affects neurological development

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:26.485 align:middle line:84%
and creates neurological
inflammation.

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:29.588 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to us?

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:33.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Well,
younger individuals are

00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:34.393 align:middle line:90%
particularly susceptible.

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:35.761 align:middle line:84%
Their systems are
not matured yet.

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:37.863 align:middle line:84%
They can't handle this
sort of contamination

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:40.432 align:middle line:84%
and when we see autism
statistics going

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:44.436 align:middle line:90%
from in 1975 one in 5000.

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:47.639 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid you
almost never heard

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:49.174 align:middle line:90%
of anybody with autism.

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, as of April of 2013, we
now have one in 50 with autism.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.316 align:middle line:84%
That's a 10,000 percent
increase statistically.

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.852 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's important
to remember too is just--

00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:02.688 align:middle line:84%
although we know these metals
are toxic in and of themselves,

00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:05.457 align:middle line:84%
we know of course aluminum
is toxic, barium, strontium.

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:08.494 align:middle line:84%
When we start combining metals,
you have synergistic toxicity.

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:12.097 align:middle line:84%
So now we know we all
have mercury in us

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
from coal-fired plants
and other sources.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.968 align:middle line:90%
Now we combine aluminum.

00:22:15.968 --> 00:22:17.469 align:middle line:90%
We've been given test recently

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that make clear the synergistic
toxicity between aluminum

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.077 align:middle line:84%
and mercury for example can
increase the overall toxicity

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:28.046 align:middle line:84%
by as much as 10,000 percent,
and that's not a rounded figure.

00:22:28.046 --> 00:22:32.451 align:middle line:84%
So, the lethalness of these
metals especially when combined

00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:34.286 align:middle line:84%
and allowed to build up in one's
system, it can't be overstated.

00:22:34.286 --> 00:22:38.123 align:middle line:84%
I mean we are literally in a
fight for to retain our health,

00:22:38.123 --> 00:22:41.894 align:middle line:84%
our cognitive function and
at that point our survival.

00:22:41.894 --> 00:22:46.598 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And how is this
impacting Alzheimer's numbers?

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:51.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: As of April
2013, we have statistics

00:22:51.437 --> 00:22:53.906 align:middle line:84%
from the Continental
US that show now,

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:58.944 align:middle line:84%
one in three seniors dies with
Alzheimer's and/or dementia.

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:01.814 align:middle line:84%
Not dies from it
but dies with it.

00:23:01.814 --> 00:23:04.116 align:middle line:84%
Those are absolutely
staggering statistics.

00:23:04.116 --> 00:23:06.652 align:middle line:84%
And what must be
remembered also, Regina,

00:23:06.652 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:90%
is that all of us are somewhere

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.355 align:middle line:84%
in between healthy
and such a diagnosis.

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:13.459 align:middle line:84%
Just because we're not diagnosed
with that sort of ailment,

00:23:13.459 --> 00:23:16.261 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that we're
not well on our way toward it.

00:23:16.261 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And I have a-- the Northern
California's top neurologist is

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:84%
a good personal friend and
he's telling me now as of

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:84%
about two weeks ago, he's
been inundated with patients

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.575 align:middle line:84%
that he's had for
a number of years

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:31.376 align:middle line:84%
that are now cognitively
dysfunctional.

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:35.147 align:middle line:84%
This should alarm--
alarm us all tremendously

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:37.783 align:middle line:84%
and again the gravity of this
issue, this is why I focused

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:40.886 align:middle line:84%
on this issue again, no
matter what else we face,

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:44.456 align:middle line:84%
if we can't continue to think
clearly and effectively,

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:46.291 align:middle line:90%
we will meet no challenges.

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:48.994 align:middle line:84%
And so, the gravity of this
issue can't be overstated.

00:23:48.994 --> 00:23:50.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And his
patients, you're--

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:53.365 align:middle line:84%
are you saying they were seniors
or they were from all age groups

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:56.802 align:middle line:84%
and they're having
these cognitive issues?

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: He's
having patients that are

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:84%
down into their 50s now that
are fairly routinely having

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.542 align:middle line:90%
increased cognitive dysfunction.

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:05.777 align:middle line:84%
So, this should be
extremely alarming.

00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And again, these materials
are bioaccumulative.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.715 align:middle line:90%
They build up on our systems.

00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:12.885 align:middle line:84%
They infiltrate easily,
they don't leave.

00:24:12.885 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So, the effect of this is
cumulative and this is something

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.425 align:middle line:84%
that all of us need
to understand in order

00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:22.594 align:middle line:84%
to get the gravity of not being
able to walk outside and breathe

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:24.897 align:middle line:90%
without sucking this stuff in.

00:24:24.897 --> 00:24:27.599 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What about
fertility rates and the effect

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:31.069 align:middle line:84%
on the developing
fetuses in the DNA?

00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:32.404 align:middle line:90%
What have you read about that?

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:33.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: Well,

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:36.341 align:middle line:84%
these particulates are
endocrine disruptors.

00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:40.412 align:middle line:84%
So, the effect all the way down
the line can't be overstated

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:43.715 align:middle line:84%
and actually, again as I said
earlier in this interview

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:47.152 align:middle line:90%
that there is nothing that lives

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:49.021 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth that's
not being negatively

00:24:49.021 --> 00:24:50.822 align:middle line:84%
and horrifically affected
by these materials.

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:54.126 align:middle line:84%
So, even if you could filter
the air, we now know--

00:24:54.126 --> 00:24:56.361 align:middle line:84%
we work with German and
Norwegian researchers

00:24:56.361 --> 00:25:00.165 align:middle line:84%
that have done considerable
study on the absorption

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:02.768 align:middle line:84%
of these nanoparticulates
in plant life

00:25:02.768 --> 00:25:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're seeing
horizontal gene mutation

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.272 align:middle line:84%
in all plant life now
that they're studying.

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:10.209 align:middle line:84%
So, what this means is that
there is no GMO anything

00:25:10.209 --> 00:25:12.377 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth at
this point, nothing.

00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing mutations
in the forest already.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.082 align:middle line:84%
I mean quite severe
permutations.

00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:22.087 align:middle line:84%
And the-- it takes
considerable time for the effect

00:25:22.087 --> 00:25:23.522 align:middle line:90%
of these materials to build up.

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:25.724 align:middle line:84%
But once it does, you have
a very nonlinear equation,

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:28.327 align:middle line:84%
things start to fray
apart quickly.

00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:32.464 align:middle line:84%
So, if we're being infiltrated
with these toxins from our food,

00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:34.499 align:middle line:84%
our air, our water,
there's nowhere to hide.

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:38.103 align:middle line:84%
So, quite simply at that
point we have a battle

00:25:38.103 --> 00:25:40.906 align:middle line:84%
of the first order that
must be brought to light

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:42.074 align:middle line:84%
or we will have nothing
to care about.

00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:43.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And we
should be having--

00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:46.144 align:middle line:84%
we should be seeing
declining fertility rates.

00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:47.679 align:middle line:84%
That should be a
portion of this.

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Shouldn't it be?

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: And we are.

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:50.849 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:25:50.849 --> 00:25:52.217 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: Indeed we are.

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:54.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But let's talk
about-- well, I mean--

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:56.321 align:middle line:84%
then you get into
the larger agendas.

00:25:56.321 --> 00:25:58.824 align:middle line:84%
But let's just stay with
the science for now, OK?

00:25:58.824 --> 00:26:02.094 align:middle line:90%
So, the other element of this

00:26:02.094 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:84%
that to me is really
very concerning is

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.868 align:middle line:84%
that we have almost a hundred
percent vitamin D deficiency

00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:13.338 align:middle line:84%
in the United States,
almost everybody.

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:16.074 align:middle line:84%
When they go in for their labs
almost everybody is vitamin D

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:18.644 align:middle line:84%
deficient unless they've
been doing supplementation.

00:26:18.644 --> 00:26:22.447 align:middle line:84%
And so, let's talk about the
effects of blocking the sun.

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:25.317 align:middle line:84%
The sun is our-- outside
of oxygen and we'll talk

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.786 align:middle line:84%
about oxygen is our
greatest nutrient.

00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:31.156 align:middle line:84%
It's the very thing that feeds
all of life on the planet.

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:35.027 align:middle line:84%
I mean that it's beyond
dastardly to think of anything

00:26:35.027 --> 00:26:37.996 align:middle line:84%
that would block us and
living systems from the sun

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:42.234 align:middle line:84%
as having any kind of
veracity to it at all.

00:26:42.234 --> 00:26:45.103 align:middle line:84%
It can't. Let's talk about
vitamin D deficiency,

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:47.139 align:middle line:90%
oxygen deprivation and the sun.

00:26:47.139 --> 00:26:48.206 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: The
last stats I've seen

00:26:48.206 --> 00:26:49.675 align:middle line:90%
on vitamin D deficiency

00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:53.779 align:middle line:84%
in the Continental US were
98 percent deficiency rates.

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:59.351 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely astounding
and to carry that further,

00:26:59.351 --> 00:27:03.722 align:middle line:84%
we don't know the full effect
of not only blocking the sun

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:07.693 align:middle line:84%
but you're also talking about an
altered light wavelength form.

00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:10.195 align:middle line:90%
So, a certain percentage

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:13.498 align:middle line:84%
of sun blockage does
not necessarily take

00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:16.768 align:middle line:84%
into account the effect of
altered light wavelength.

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:19.204 align:middle line:84%
So, there's no study
even on this.

00:27:19.204 --> 00:27:23.008 align:middle line:84%
So-- and the vitamin D
deficiency again added

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:24.776 align:middle line:84%
to a weakened immune system
from barium, the aluminum.

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:28.547 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is a
very, very lethal mix,

00:27:28.547 --> 00:27:30.015 align:middle line:90%
oxygen deprivation as well.

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:35.287 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, global
oxygen content is plummeting

00:27:35.287 --> 00:27:37.923 align:middle line:84%
and as we-- as these
particulates bioavailable,

00:27:37.923 --> 00:27:40.625 align:middle line:84%
build up in the soils,
we know from soil studies

00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:45.363 align:middle line:84%
from for example, University of
Riverside that larger organisms

00:27:45.363 --> 00:27:47.332 align:middle line:84%
like trees, they
sense this toxin,

00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.501 align:middle line:84%
they shut down nutrient
uptake, they die a slow death.

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:53.338 align:middle line:84%
So, now what we have
arboreal forests that instead

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:56.675 align:middle line:84%
of being carbon sinks and
absorbing carbon and thriving

00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:59.211 align:middle line:84%
from an increased hydrological
cycle which we would have

00:27:59.211 --> 00:28:01.213 align:middle line:84%
without geoengineering
blocking the sun.

00:28:01.213 --> 00:28:03.081 align:middle line:84%
So, the sun is necessary
for evaporation,

00:28:03.081 --> 00:28:04.583 align:middle line:90%
the hydrological cycle.

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:08.253 align:middle line:84%
So, we have forests now which
are the terrestrial lungs

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:12.958 align:middle line:84%
of the planet that are--
instead of absorbing carbon

00:28:12.958 --> 00:28:15.694 align:middle line:84%
and releasing oxygen
they're now--

00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:17.229 align:middle line:90%
they've become carbon sources

00:28:17.229 --> 00:28:18.597 align:middle line:84%
and they're not releasing
oxygen.

00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:21.099 align:middle line:84%
And so, we have global
oxygen content plummeting.

00:28:21.099 --> 00:28:22.134 align:middle line:84%
We have carbon further
escalating

00:28:22.134 --> 00:28:24.703 align:middle line:84%
because now it's
a feedback loop.

00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:26.972 align:middle line:90%
We have a decimated ozone layer,

00:28:26.972 --> 00:28:29.007 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
perhaps you can elaborate

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:30.475 align:middle line:84%
on because we have
measurements on this.

00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:32.677 align:middle line:84%
So, that ozone layer
is killing plankton.

00:28:32.677 --> 00:28:35.380 align:middle line:84%
We have a 50 percent decline
in global plankton stocks,

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:38.817 align:middle line:84%
thus even less oxygen being
emitted to the atmosphere.

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:40.585 align:middle line:84%
This little oxygen
leads to oxidation.

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:43.989 align:middle line:84%
It's-- we have a
really severe situation

00:28:43.989 --> 00:28:46.158 align:middle line:84%
from so many directions
and it's all--

00:28:46.158 --> 00:28:48.894 align:middle line:84%
it all interacts with
the other factors.

00:28:48.894 --> 00:28:52.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Go ahead and talk
about the ozone layer aspect.

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:55.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: We have a number
of studies on the effect

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:57.102 align:middle line:84%
of particulates in
the atmosphere

00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:59.137 align:middle line:84%
for major institutions
like MIT, you know,

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:00.772 align:middle line:90%
some of the other university.

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:02.841 align:middle line:84%
So, there's no dispute
on what particulates do

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:04.676 align:middle line:90%
in the upper atmosphere.

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:06.044 align:middle line:90%
They shred ozone.

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:07.746 align:middle line:84%
So, although we've been
given red herring excuses,

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:12.818 align:middle line:84%
the CFCs as being the
primary cause of destruction,

00:29:12.818 --> 00:29:13.885 align:middle line:90%
we believe that's a red herring.

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:16.721 align:middle line:90%
Not to say the CFCs are good

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:19.357 align:middle line:84%
but since we know this
experimentation has been going

00:29:19.357 --> 00:29:23.161 align:middle line:84%
on since at least the
late '40s, we have studies

00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:24.896 align:middle line:84%
where they were detecting
these metal particulates

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:26.164 align:middle line:90%
around the poles.

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And we know it causes
ozone destruction

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.235 align:middle line:84%
so we had the big
southern hemisphere hole.

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:32.637 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a huge
northern hemisphere hole.

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:36.575 align:middle line:84%
People have no idea that
there is this phenomenon.

00:29:36.575 --> 00:29:38.844 align:middle line:90%
So, we knew it was bad.

00:29:38.844 --> 00:29:40.111 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know how bad.

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.881 align:middle line:84%
We've recently acquired
metering equipment.

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:46.284 align:middle line:84%
It was-- with funds donated
to us for this purpose.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:51.656 align:middle line:84%
We're metering in California,
Maine, Florida, New Mexico.

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:55.126 align:middle line:84%
What we know now is that
based on our metering,

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.528 align:middle line:84%
and this is very
straightforward metering.

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:59.965 align:middle line:84%
It's not any speculation
involved with this, but UVB,

00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:02.834 align:middle line:84%
the more lethal band
of radiation

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:07.439 align:middle line:84%
that we are told is supposed
to be no more than five percent

00:30:07.439 --> 00:30:10.942 align:middle line:84%
of the total UV is
now 60 percent.

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:14.479 align:middle line:84%
And there's a 1200
percent increase in UVB.

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:17.582 align:middle line:84%
It's literally, Regina, it's
burning the bark off of trees

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:20.819 align:middle line:84%
in Northern California
from the trunk to the tip.

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:23.355 align:middle line:84%
And this UVB is incredibly
intense.

00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:25.123 align:middle line:90%
People are feeling it.

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:28.059 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most
conservative math we can use,

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:31.830 align:middle line:84%
1200 percent increase in UVB
and we're even getting some UVC

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:36.067 align:middle line:84%
which is the last band before
x-ray and UVC we're told

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:40.872 align:middle line:84%
by all major agencies like NOAA
that UVC stops 100,000 feet

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:42.140 align:middle line:90%
up in the atmosphere no more.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.809 align:middle line:84%
We have almost ozone
holes in many places

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:46.177 align:middle line:90%
around the northern hemisphere.

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:49.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So this has to
be impacting the numbers

00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:84%
of cancers having to do
with skin for example?

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: It can't not be.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:90%
It can't not be.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.721 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely is.

00:30:56.721 --> 00:30:59.257 align:middle line:84%
And you coupled a-- immune
system issues, we already talked

00:30:59.257 --> 00:31:03.361 align:middle line:84%
about and, you know,
we have really a crisis

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.263 align:middle line:84%
of the first order
from so many directions

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:07.699 align:middle line:84%
and so many roads lead the
right back to geoengineering.

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:10.468 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm not saying that
we haven't done a lot of damage

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:13.538 align:middle line:84%
to the planet and from
many directions we have.

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:17.175 align:middle line:84%
But geoengineering, when
its full ramifications are

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:19.077 align:middle line:84%
considered is the single
greatest destructive force

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:21.046 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth right now.

00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:22.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I agree with you.

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:26.351 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is we've gotten
caught into these debates

00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:28.987 align:middle line:84%
about global cooling,
global warming.

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:32.524 align:middle line:84%
Back and forth, scientists
have argued the fraud behind.

00:31:32.524 --> 00:31:33.858 align:middle line:84%
Some of the science
has been exposed.

00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:37.595 align:middle line:84%
But-- and I heard you in
one of your interviews

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:40.832 align:middle line:84%
with someone else and you were
both talking about the fact

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:46.972 align:middle line:84%
that even if you start
excluding the political debate

00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:48.406 align:middle line:90%
as to whether it's warming

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:49.708 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's cooling
'cause we can see now it's all

00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:53.111 align:middle line:84%
manipulated anyway, you
cannot exclude the fact

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:54.546 align:middle line:90%
that we're being poisoned.

00:31:54.546 --> 00:31:55.914 align:middle line:84%
Everything on the
planet is being poisoned.

00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:59.284 align:middle line:84%
That seems to me to be
the most critical factor.

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:01.419 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the changes
and severe changes

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:03.989 align:middle line:84%
in weather matter
hugely but the fact

00:32:03.989 --> 00:32:08.493 align:middle line:84%
that every living system is
being poisoned can't be debated.

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:09.728 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: It
can't be debated.

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:11.496 align:middle line:84%
We have lab test in
Northern California.

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:14.866 align:middle line:84%
We've done six or
seven dozen lab tests

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:16.034 align:middle line:90%
in the state certified lab.

00:32:16.034 --> 00:32:17.602 align:middle line:84%
This material is
falling on us, period.

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.004 align:middle line:90%
There's no debate about that.

00:32:19.004 --> 00:32:21.006 align:middle line:84%
Many people try to leap
that it's coming from China.

00:32:21.006 --> 00:32:24.476 align:middle line:84%
We have studies from CARB,
California Air Resources Board,

00:32:24.476 --> 00:32:25.977 align:middle line:90%
on the aerosols from China.

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Heavy metals don't float across
oceans with the exception

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.882 align:middle line:84%
of mercury because mercury
converts to a gaseous state.

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:37.055 align:middle line:84%
But these metals are of
local origins and the amount

00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:38.456 align:middle line:90%
of buildup is astounding.

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:42.127 align:middle line:84%
We've had rain tests
escalate from a baseline test

00:32:42.127 --> 00:32:43.895 align:middle line:84%
of 7 parts per billion
of aluminum

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:45.263 align:middle line:90%
when I first began testing

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:47.465 align:middle line:84%
and these programs have
been ramped up much since.

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:51.870 align:middle line:84%
We've had subsequent test go--
escalate almost 50,000 percent

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.707 align:middle line:84%
to 3400 and 50 parts per
billion, literally toxic rain.

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:57.809 align:middle line:84%
We can't grow anything
in Northern California.

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:01.379 align:middle line:84%
With the exception of heavy soil
augmentation, things don't grow.

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:03.415 align:middle line:84%
Even native plants
are not growing.

00:33:03.415 --> 00:33:04.916 align:middle line:90%
And regarding the climate,

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:07.252 align:middle line:84%
certainly that the health
issues are first and foremost

00:33:07.252 --> 00:33:09.921 align:middle line:84%
because if we can't think
clearly, we're not going

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:11.423 align:middle line:90%
to deal with anything.

00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:84%
However, in regards to the
climate, the decimation now is

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.029 align:middle line:84%
so severe that the
climate alone--

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:84%
if we stay on this track,
we are looking at a planet

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.470 align:middle line:84%
that will very soon not support
life, and this is where I try

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:29.007 align:middle line:84%
to get people past Al Gore to
look at the absolute solid data.

00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:30.442 align:middle line:84%
And this will be hard
to hide for much longer

00:33:30.442 --> 00:33:34.546 align:middle line:84%
because the warming is
absolutely profound.

00:33:34.546 --> 00:33:37.582 align:middle line:84%
In geoengineering, this is an
important part of this equation.

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:39.651 align:middle line:90%
Although the geoengineers can

00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:43.888 align:middle line:84%
and do create huge cooling
anomalies like we just saw

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:46.091 align:middle line:84%
around the first of the
year, it comes at the cost

00:33:46.091 --> 00:33:47.625 align:middle line:90%
of a worsened overall warming

00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and they've triggered
feedback loops

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:54.766 align:middle line:84%
like methane hydrate expulsion
from the Artic, the Laptev Sea,

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:57.836 align:middle line:84%
and this methane literally
holds life on Earth

00:33:57.836 --> 00:34:00.004 align:middle line:84%
in the balance aside from the
toxic issue we've discussed.

00:34:00.004 --> 00:34:04.809 align:middle line:84%
So, the walls are closing in
from a number of sides, Regina.

00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:06.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: They are.

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:07.645 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go back a
moment in terms of the soil.

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:09.481 align:middle line:84%
And you talked about the
forest and the damage

00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:13.550 align:middle line:84%
to the forest a bit
and I've also read

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.422 align:middle line:84%
and watched the documentaries
as you have about the effects

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.556 align:middle line:84%
of the soil even
just in gardening,

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:21.626 align:middle line:84%
even in our agricultural
industries,

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.293 align:middle line:90%
even in backyard gardening.

00:34:23.293 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed the phenomena for
example in Northern California.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:27.799 align:middle line:84%
One thing that keeps
happening is

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:29.967 align:middle line:84%
that the tomato crops
keep failing.

00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:34.572 align:middle line:84%
Instead of planting one hardy
round of tomatoes in say April

00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:36.674 align:middle line:84%
or May and having
beautiful tomatoes by the end

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:39.777 align:middle line:84%
of the season, which you could
always predict in the past,

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:42.313 align:middle line:84%
you have to plant them two to
three times sometimes and still

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:46.818 align:middle line:84%
with very small yields
in a lot of cases.

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:49.753 align:middle line:84%
Is this part of what
you're talking about?

00:34:49.753 --> 00:34:52.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: That's absolutely
directly connected when--

00:34:52.357 --> 00:34:53.892 align:middle line:90%
and there's a number of aspects

00:34:53.892 --> 00:34:57.962 align:middle line:84%
that again the soil microbes
are literally being sterilized

00:34:57.962 --> 00:35:01.733 align:middle line:84%
out of the soil, you know,
a bioavailable aluminum

00:35:01.733 --> 00:35:04.936 align:middle line:84%
and other heavy metals that the
root systems detect, and again,

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:06.204 align:middle line:90%
we outlined that earlier.

00:35:06.204 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:84%
We know the effect of such
metals on nutrient uptake.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.378 align:middle line:84%
You also have this
extreme UVB and the effects

00:35:13.378 --> 00:35:15.313 align:middle line:84%
of this extreme UVB
are well documented

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:19.384 align:middle line:84%
and that absolutely affects
ability of plants to fruit.

00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:22.754 align:middle line:84%
It affects their
level of foliage.

00:35:22.754 --> 00:35:26.791 align:middle line:84%
This is a very lethal
level of radiation and so--

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:28.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:29.694 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: -- you start
coupling all these together,

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:31.229 align:middle line:84%
you have a very, very serious
combination of problems

00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:90%
that will render us unable

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.299 align:middle line:84%
to grow our own food
soon, our own tomatoes.

00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:36.801 align:middle line:84%
South America, I
believe Argentina

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:40.972 align:middle line:84%
and several other countries
actually announced in spring

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:84%
of this year that
their population needed

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to consume less tomatoes because
their crops had absolutely hit

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.612 align:middle line:84%
the wall there and
the tomato industry

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:48.613 align:middle line:90%
or the tomato growing as well.

00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:51.049 align:middle line:90%
So, it's not a localized issue.

00:35:51.049 --> 00:35:53.551 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it also affects
the acidity content of the soil

00:35:53.551 --> 00:35:55.086 align:middle line:90%
which affects every crop, right?

00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:56.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: It
radically affects acidity.

00:35:56.888 --> 00:36:01.192 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
equation has been spun a bit.

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:04.762 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you have
acidic soils like we do

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:07.432 align:middle line:84%
in Northern California, we have
a normal acidity in the forest

00:36:07.432 --> 00:36:12.570 align:middle line:84%
for 5.0, 5.5 and I've
been in the field testing

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:17.408 align:middle line:84%
with USTA scientists and
coming up with pH values 15,

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:19.677 align:middle line:84%
in some cases, 20 times
more than baseline.

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:21.246 align:middle line:90%
And we had solid baselines

00:36:21.246 --> 00:36:24.849 align:middle line:84%
because I have the original USTA
studies, very extensive manuals.

00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:27.418 align:middle line:84%
But for these guys
for example to go

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:28.753 align:middle line:90%
on the record, they won't do it.

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:30.421 align:middle line:84%
They have no First
Amendment protection.

00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:90%
They absolutely won't do it.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.959 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to NOAA scientists
at the marine lab, same story.

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:37.662 align:middle line:84%
A direct quote was,
"We're alarmed as hell.

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:38.830 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what to do.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.732 align:middle line:84%
We have no First
Amendment protection."

00:36:40.732 --> 00:36:42.834 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a huge
segment of academia

00:36:42.834 --> 00:36:45.970 align:middle line:84%
that knows this is going
on but simply still hiding

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.540 align:middle line:84%
in the shadows but the whole
ship is going down and I hope

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.877 align:middle line:84%
that academia find
its backbone soon

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:55.013 align:middle line:84%
because if not we'll have
nothing left to save.

00:36:55.013 --> 00:36:58.216 align:middle line:84%
But we're seeing huge
pH changes and the area

00:36:58.216 --> 00:37:00.418 align:middle line:84%
that where this is spun
that I mentioned earlier,

00:37:00.418 --> 00:37:03.688 align:middle line:84%
we had a New York Times reporter
that was going to cover this.

00:37:03.688 --> 00:37:07.025 align:middle line:84%
He spoke to a biologist in
Montana who said, "Oh no,

00:37:07.025 --> 00:37:09.727 align:middle line:84%
the forest floor pH
is normally 7.5."

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:12.363 align:middle line:84%
Yes, in Montana not
in California.

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:14.766 align:middle line:84%
So this is the sort of mental
breakdown you have occurring

00:37:14.766 --> 00:37:18.102 align:middle line:84%
in academia that helps them
to stand in their bubbles

00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:20.738 align:middle line:84%
and in the meantime the house
is burning to the ground.

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Indeed.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.408 align:middle line:84%
And California is the
breadbasket for a lot

00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:24.942 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
in terms of many,

00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:27.645 align:middle line:90%
many crops including nut trees

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:30.281 align:middle line:84%
which I hear fortunately
are not quite as vulnerable

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:33.785 align:middle line:84%
as some others, that being a
very big crop in California.

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:36.254 align:middle line:84%
But what is the FDAs
responsibility in all these?

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:38.222 align:middle line:84%
What are-- aren't they
taking any measurements?

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Aren't they measuring
levels of these heavy metals

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.195 align:middle line:84%
in our soils, in
our food supplies?

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:46.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: That's a
very interesting question

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:48.032 align:middle line:90%
and this is my answer.

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:50.835 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've been in high
level EPA meeting one

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:52.337 align:middle line:84%
in Sacramento arranged
by a congressional rep,

00:37:52.337 --> 00:37:57.608 align:middle line:84%
five top level EPA officials
in this closed door meeting,

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.410 align:middle line:84%
told in my face that
they are mandated to test

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.446 align:middle line:84%
for combustion particulates
only.

00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:04.849 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the sample
goes out the window.

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:06.284 align:middle line:84%
You can't find what
you're not looking for.

00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:10.688 align:middle line:84%
California EPA also
does not test rainfall.

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:11.789 align:middle line:84%
They don't care what's
in the rain.

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:13.324 align:middle line:84%
They are mandated
not the test it.

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:18.262 align:middle line:84%
We know now California water
quality stopped testing for--

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:20.264 align:middle line:90%
in the water in 2002.

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:23.234 align:middle line:84%
California Department of
Fish and Game now who is--

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:26.371 align:middle line:84%
they are required to test
for runoff with anybody

00:38:26.371 --> 00:38:30.074 align:middle line:84%
who contributes to runoff,
everything you could think of,

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:33.144 align:middle line:84%
130 plus elements
but not aluminum.

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:36.914 align:middle line:84%
So the system has been
designed from bottom to top not

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:38.683 align:middle line:90%
to show this contamination.

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:40.018 align:middle line:84%
We need to get that
through their head.

00:38:40.018 --> 00:38:41.519 align:middle line:84%
If they think that
agencies are going

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.688 align:middle line:90%
to tell them, they're wrong.

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:45.323 align:middle line:84%
And also, the particulate
size we're talking about here,

00:38:45.323 --> 00:38:48.826 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the smaller
the particulate the more lethal

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:49.460 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:51.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: And they
talk about, you know, 2.5.

00:38:51.963 --> 00:38:53.064 align:middle line:84%
You're familiar with
that probably.

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.232 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about particulates

00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:56.100 align:middle line:90%
that are exponentially smaller

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.969 align:middle line:84%
than the smallest
particulate they test for.

00:38:57.969 --> 00:39:01.539 align:middle line:84%
So they can't show up and
the system is designed again

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.808 align:middle line:84%
to keep all these
stuff under the radar.

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And when
you're talking

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:06.444 align:middle line:84%
about particulate matter,
nanoparticulate matter

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:08.346 align:middle line:90%
like that, you're talking

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:11.449 align:middle line:84%
about it passing the
blood-brain barrier for example.

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:14.318 align:middle line:84%
This is pervasive throughout
the body and being stored

00:39:14.318 --> 00:39:17.622 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, the hippocampus
and such as we talked

00:39:17.622 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:90%
about a little bit ago.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.058 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about some
other elements of this.

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:24.529 align:middle line:84%
About, I think it was in 2001
or 2002, one of the people

00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:29.967 align:middle line:84%
that I was researching with on
this subject was in partnership,

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:33.971 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, with one of the
Project Paperclip or scientist,

00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:36.974 align:middle line:84%
one in the old guys
and this fellow,

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:38.776 align:middle line:90%
they were gathering samples.

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:40.011 align:middle line:90%
I won't mention where.

00:39:40.011 --> 00:39:43.214 align:middle line:84%
They were gathering
samples of snowfall

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:47.351 align:middle line:84%
in their particular region and
it wasn't just the aluminum,

00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:84%
strontium and barium,
there were biologicals.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:84%
There was E. coli and there
were some other elements

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.025 align:middle line:90%
in there as well.

00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:56.894 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about the perhaps
weaponization of these--

00:39:56.894 --> 00:40:00.832 align:middle line:84%
biological weaponization
of these aerosols.

00:40:00.832 --> 00:40:03.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Yes, and this
should not be a surprise

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:08.773 align:middle line:84%
to people when we know we
have a historical record

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:10.041 align:middle line:90%
of such biological testing done

00:40:10.041 --> 00:40:13.110 align:middle line:84%
by our government again
and again and again.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.746 align:middle line:84%
So when we have in Northern
California for example I--

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:18.883 align:middle line:84%
I again I live in a wilderness
area and I spend a lot

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:21.118 align:middle line:90%
of time there and at one night

00:40:21.118 --> 00:40:23.521 align:middle line:84%
in the winter two years
ago I saw a KC-135 come

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.423 align:middle line:84%
over our mountain
right down on the deck

00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:29.393 align:middle line:84%
when there was a low layer of
fog over Redding, California.

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:31.329 align:middle line:90%
This is an unusual layer of fog.

00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:34.098 align:middle line:84%
We don't normally have that
phenomena, but it was dumping.

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:38.703 align:middle line:84%
This aircraft was 5-6,000 feet
up absolutely dumping something

00:40:38.703 --> 00:40:40.304 align:middle line:84%
and then we matched
the statistic

00:40:40.304 --> 00:40:42.607 align:middle line:84%
and yes this is all
anecdotal but according

00:40:42.607 --> 00:40:44.709 align:middle line:84%
to even mainstream
media here, 48,

00:40:44.709 --> 00:40:48.379 align:middle line:84%
49 percent of our
population is chronically ill.

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:50.648 align:middle line:90%
MRSA is rampant here.

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:53.284 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
everything matches.

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:55.987 align:middle line:84%
And again, we know at minimum
we have a weakened immune system

00:40:55.987 --> 00:40:59.223 align:middle line:84%
from these materials
and there has been

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:02.026 align:middle line:84%
with the Carnicom Institute,
they've actually found pathogens

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:04.896 align:middle line:84%
that they feel in their
own words are engineered.

00:41:04.896 --> 00:41:06.931 align:middle line:84%
So why would we not
think this is going

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.799 align:middle line:84%
on when the government has
a history of doing this

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:09.967 align:middle line:90%
and we know that they're--

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:11.402 align:middle line:84%
they're dumping these
toxins on us.

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:14.472 align:middle line:84%
Why would we not believe
that bio testing is going on?

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:16.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: OK, that
takes us into the subject

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:19.043 align:middle line:84%
of transhumanism
and then further one

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:22.013 align:middle line:84%
of the subjects I just--
I don't even like talking

00:41:22.013 --> 00:41:26.651 align:middle line:84%
about because it's to
me it's frightening,

00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:28.753 align:middle line:90%
it makes me very sad and then

00:41:28.753 --> 00:41:30.788 align:middle line:84%
for that reason I've never
even done a story on it,

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:32.390 align:middle line:90%
which is Morgellons disease.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:33.391 align:middle line:90%
It's not a disease,

00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:35.459 align:middle line:84%
but Morgellons syndrome,
whatever it is.

00:41:35.459 --> 00:41:38.896 align:middle line:84%
So, first let's talk about
how these chemtrails interface

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:41.699 align:middle line:84%
with the whole subject
of transhumanism,

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:44.201 align:middle line:84%
which also gets into
GMOs and such.

00:41:44.201 --> 00:41:45.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: It does and this--

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:48.873 align:middle line:84%
this is a subject that most
people have not heard of

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:51.442 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds extremely
science fiction to them.

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:54.979 align:middle line:84%
And there's a few in the
anti-geoengineering movement

00:41:54.979 --> 00:41:57.582 align:middle line:84%
that are more specialized
in this area.

00:41:57.582 --> 00:41:59.450 align:middle line:84%
But to give some
simple building blocks

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.453 align:middle line:84%
that people would understand,
there is no debate or dispute

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:07.091 align:middle line:84%
that they have created
self replicating particles

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and if these particles are in
fact combined or associated

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.333 align:middle line:84%
with a smart dust which
also exist scientifically.

00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:19.103 align:middle line:84%
There's no debate about that
either and we're inhaling this.

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:23.341 align:middle line:84%
We can really go down a rabbit
hole with this and try to begin

00:42:23.341 --> 00:42:27.011 align:middle line:84%
to determine what they
might do to our organisms.

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:28.613 align:middle line:90%
We have really little debate

00:42:28.613 --> 00:42:33.117 align:middle line:84%
on electronically stimulated
biotech and what this means is

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:35.620 align:middle line:84%
if we're all seeded with
an organism or a pathogen

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:42.226 align:middle line:84%
that is stimulated by a given
radiofrequency, in theory then

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:46.297 align:middle line:84%
that organism could be triggered
and made virulent at any point

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:49.066 align:middle line:84%
in time we're exposed
to such a frequency.

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:51.736 align:middle line:84%
And for those that
this sounds sci-fi to,

00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:54.905 align:middle line:84%
I would make them remember
that if you go back 200 years

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:56.607 align:middle line:84%
and told someone you could
talk in a box to somebody

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:58.576 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the world
that nobody would believe it.

00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:03.881 align:middle line:84%
So, this technology does
in fact seem to exist

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:06.617 align:middle line:84%
and where it leads, it's
difficult to say but back

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:09.353 align:middle line:84%
to the plant organisms which we
know it's happening with them,

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:12.223 align:middle line:84%
horizontal gene mutation,
why would we not think

00:43:12.223 --> 00:43:15.626 align:middle line:84%
that similar occurrences
are beginning to happen

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:17.495 align:middle line:90%
in the human organism as well.

00:43:17.495 --> 00:43:21.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And actually on one
of the sites, I think it was--

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:25.936 align:middle line:84%
it may have been one that you
link to, it was showing cells

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:29.640 align:middle line:84%
from I believe it was
dogs and the impact

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.075 align:middle line:90%
of what was happening.

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:33.511 align:middle line:84%
And this is going into now
the subject of Morgellons.

00:43:33.511 --> 00:43:35.579 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about that a little
bit and what they're seeing

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:38.849 align:middle line:84%
in the cellular structure of
animals which is very similar

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:40.251 align:middle line:90%
to what they're seeing in us.

00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:41.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: You know,
this is an area of specialty

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:47.525 align:middle line:84%
that Clifford Carnicom and his
institution are more versed in.

00:43:47.525 --> 00:43:49.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:50.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: I mean-- and
again the various effects are

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:52.229 align:middle line:90%
extremely numerous.

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:55.099 align:middle line:84%
People are pulling
fibers out of lesions

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:56.667 align:middle line:90%
on their bodies with Morgellons

00:43:56.667 --> 00:44:01.806 align:middle line:84%
that appear to be in some cases
replicating and, you know,

00:44:01.806 --> 00:44:03.207 align:middle line:90%
this is-- this is something

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:05.576 align:middle line:84%
that mainstream media is
trying to ignore right now.

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:08.412 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to pretend
Morgellons doesn't exist

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:10.781 align:middle line:84%
but it's more and more
coming to the surface,

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:12.650 align:middle line:84%
again along with all
the other ailments

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.385 align:middle line:90%
that we already touched upon,

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:16.654 align:middle line:84%
respiratory mortality
for example.

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:19.924 align:middle line:84%
In the continental US from 2005
to 2010, it went from eighth

00:44:19.924 --> 00:44:21.659 align:middle line:84%
on the list of mortality
to third.

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:24.628 align:middle line:84%
We understand now, you see, the
fact that it's gone

00:44:24.628 --> 00:44:27.565 align:middle line:84%
into second and perhaps
getting closer to first.

00:44:27.565 --> 00:44:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies can only take
so much of this inhalation

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.608 align:middle line:84%
of toxic particulates and once
the saturation point is reached,

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:42.213 align:middle line:84%
decline happens very quickly
and a host of diseases

00:44:42.213 --> 00:44:45.249 align:middle line:84%
and ailments ensues and then
the other technology that's

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:48.419 align:middle line:84%
in us were still-- it's
still a difficult subject

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:51.489 align:middle line:84%
to verify but in an
overall sense again

00:44:51.489 --> 00:44:54.291 align:middle line:84%
from the climate
feedback mechanisms

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:56.727 align:middle line:84%
that these programs are helping
to trigger to the toxification

00:44:56.727 --> 00:45:01.499 align:middle line:84%
of our soils, waters, air,
decimation of the ozone layer,

00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:05.369 align:middle line:84%
this is from every single
direction, the greatest all

00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:09.607 align:middle line:84%
out assault on life on earth
that has ever occurred.

00:45:09.607 --> 00:45:12.443 align:middle line:84%
And if we start to tie it
into other things too, Regina,

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:14.945 align:middle line:84%
for example the nuclear issue
which is absolutely huge.

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you're--

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, absolutely.

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:18.149 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with that, yes.

00:45:18.149 --> 00:45:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Well,
the two are connected.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.720 align:middle line:90%
And when we see Fukushima

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.589 align:middle line:84%
that we know we have three
core meltdowns there,

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:27.858 align:middle line:84%
but where's that radiation
going and what's affecting

00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:29.126 align:middle line:90%
where that radiation is going?

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:30.194 align:middle line:90%
Geoengineering is.

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:32.163 align:middle line:90%
And they can-- right now,

00:45:32.163 --> 00:45:33.964 align:middle line:84%
they're thwarting the
hydrological cycle

00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:35.433 align:middle line:90%
in California, the rain cycle.

00:45:35.433 --> 00:45:37.601 align:middle line:90%
It is being completely blocked.

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:39.837 align:middle line:84%
And we know this because we
have sat photo, satellite photos

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:42.106 align:middle line:84%
of the Eastern Pacific
that are--

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:45.009 align:middle line:84%
it's blanket sprayed
every single day.

00:45:45.009 --> 00:45:46.944 align:middle line:84%
So, they're blocking
that hydrological cycle

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:49.113 align:middle line:84%
from actually occurring
over California.

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:51.682 align:middle line:84%
The drought here is
cataclysmic already.

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:55.653 align:middle line:84%
And because they
aerosolized the atmosphere

00:45:55.653 --> 00:45:58.455 align:middle line:84%
and this radiation is not being
rained out over the ocean,

00:45:58.455 --> 00:45:59.890 align:middle line:84%
not that that's a good
thing but it's better

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.392 align:middle line:90%
than having a rain out on us.

00:46:01.392 --> 00:46:05.129 align:middle line:84%
They can in fact migrate this
radiation very effectively

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.964 align:middle line:84%
to wherever they
want it to come down.

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:08.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Because if they
see a smaller condensation

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:14.638 align:middle line:84%
nuclei, then raindrops don't
combine and fall as rain.

00:46:14.638 --> 00:46:16.273 align:middle line:90%
The moisture just migrates.

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:18.709 align:middle line:84%
And certain particles
like fluoride,

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:19.910 align:middle line:90%
and we have fluoride showing

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.413 align:middle line:84%
up in 60 rain tests
from Norway now.

00:46:22.413 --> 00:46:24.882 align:middle line:84%
So, fluoride may be
in the mix as well.

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:26.584 align:middle line:84%
There may be many
reasons for that.

00:46:26.584 --> 00:46:29.053 align:middle line:84%
But one, if fluoride
particulates are exposed

00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:30.254 align:middle line:84%
to certain radiofrequency,
they combine,

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:32.923 align:middle line:84%
they form a bigger
condensation nuclei.

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So on theory, they could migrate
this radiation wherever they

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.761 align:middle line:84%
want, expose the
seeded particulates

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:43.767 align:middle line:84%
to a particular frequency,
cause larger condensation nuclei

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:46.937 align:middle line:84%
and cause that material to
come down wherever they wanted

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:48.305 align:middle line:90%
on whoever they wanted.

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:51.442 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to this,
we have one Fukushima now

00:46:51.442 --> 00:46:53.677 align:middle line:84%
with a shredded ozone layer
if we have a large CME,

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:57.381 align:middle line:84%
a coronal mass ejection like a
Carrington event from the 1800s,

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:58.916 align:middle line:84%
we could have grids shut
down around the globe.

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:02.853 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, we could
have Fukushima times a hundred

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:03.954 align:middle line:90%
or 200.

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:06.891 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, all
roads lead back

00:47:06.891 --> 00:47:08.492 align:middle line:90%
to geoengineering to a degree.

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:10.828 align:middle line:84%
If we can't think straight,
we won't be able to deal

00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:12.396 align:middle line:90%
with the nuclear issue.

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:17.401 align:middle line:84%
And if geoengineering continues
unabated we may have Fukushima

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:18.869 align:middle line:90%
times as many as I stated.

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:20.971 align:middle line:90%
So, it's a viscous circle.

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:22.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you
were just commenting

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:23.774 align:middle line:84%
on the coronal mass
ejections of the sun.

00:47:23.774 --> 00:47:26.944 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
the timing of all these

00:47:26.944 --> 00:47:30.281 align:middle line:84%
because this is all peaking
and occurring just as the sun

00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:32.082 align:middle line:84%
who has gone through
its own polarity shift.

00:47:32.082 --> 00:47:34.885 align:middle line:84%
It flipped what on this
28th or 29th of December

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:39.156 align:middle line:84%
which it does every 11 years
in this back and forth cycle.

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:42.760 align:middle line:84%
But when it's doing that,
it has anomalous behavior

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and it has increased coronal
mass ejection sunspots

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:47.665 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:47:47.665 --> 00:47:49.199 align:middle line:84%
So, all of this is
at a peak right now

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:52.202 align:middle line:84%
when we're also seeing
this crazy weather.

00:47:52.202 --> 00:47:54.638 align:middle line:84%
I mean I don't think
there's anyone out there

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:57.508 align:middle line:84%
that wouldn't agree weather is
changing, whether it's heating,

00:47:57.508 --> 00:47:59.543 align:middle line:84%
whether it's cooling,
it's definitely changing.

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:03.914 align:middle line:84%
I think in Sacramento last
week it was in the 70s.

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:07.117 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in California and in
January, we should be looking

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:09.987 align:middle line:84%
at something more like
50 or 40 degrees even

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:12.656 align:middle line:84%
in the daytime, it
was in the 70s.

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.925 align:middle line:84%
And this is really common
now to have these kinds

00:48:14.925 --> 00:48:16.560 align:middle line:90%
of anomalous patterns.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Well, yeah,
this is becoming the norm.

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:20.864 align:middle line:84%
For this event on the East
Coast, New York two weeks ago,

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:24.134 align:middle line:84%
a little over two weeks
shattered their all time high

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:25.636 align:middle line:90%
record of 70.

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:28.605 align:middle line:84%
They hit 70 degrees, breaking
the record by 10 degrees.

00:48:28.605 --> 00:48:31.241 align:middle line:84%
They plunged into this
record cold for a few days

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:33.577 align:middle line:84%
and I think the forecast
for Saturday

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:84%
for New York is 60
degrees and rain again.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.116 align:middle line:84%
Rain-- we have to Minnesota
where they just had 20 below.

00:48:39.116 --> 00:48:41.919 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be
raining on Saturday.

00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:44.221 align:middle line:84%
Now, this can change on a
dime because if they decide

00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:45.990 align:middle line:84%
to nucleate a certain
portion of the storm--

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:47.358 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:48:47.358 --> 00:48:48.459 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: -- then that
can change the dynamics.

00:48:48.459 --> 00:48:50.594 align:middle line:84%
But this effect is
getting worse.

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:54.498 align:middle line:84%
This sort of whipsaw
rollercoaster behavior

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:56.367 align:middle line:84%
of the weather patterns
is getting worse.

00:48:56.367 --> 00:48:58.335 align:middle line:90%
But the overall trend--

00:48:58.335 --> 00:49:01.772 align:middle line:84%
and again, I can't
stress the dire magnitude

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:04.041 align:middle line:84%
of the methane hydrate
release is going on.

00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:05.209 align:middle line:90%
It's coming--

00:49:05.209 --> 00:49:06.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's
talk about the ocean.

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.512 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about methane
and the ocean now and let's talk

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:12.349 align:middle line:84%
about the algae blooms, those
incredible massive green blooms

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:15.252 align:middle line:84%
in China, massive blood
red ones in Australia,

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:16.820 align:middle line:90%
things we shouldn't be seeing.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:17.755 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:49:17.755 --> 00:49:19.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: People
seem to feel

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that if McDonald's is
open flipping burgers

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.863 align:middle line:84%
and Walmart is still operational
that the planet is fine

00:49:25.863 --> 00:49:27.631 align:middle line:84%
and people are just
simply caught up on a lot

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:29.166 align:middle line:90%
of reality shows and so forth,

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:30.434 align:middle line:84%
they don't understand what's
happening in China for example

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:32.136 align:middle line:90%
when they have algae blooms

00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:33.937 align:middle line:84%
that are creating
mats under the ocean.

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:35.706 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've seen
that, the films of this.

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:37.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:38.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: You know it goes
up quarter mile, half mile.

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:39.543 align:middle line:84%
Oceans are dying,
period, plain and simply.

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:42.946 align:middle line:90%
No ocean life, no life on earth.

00:49:42.946 --> 00:49:46.116 align:middle line:84%
So, we have oceans right
now acidifying rapidly.

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:48.118 align:middle line:84%
We have plankton populations
as I stated earlier are

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:50.854 align:middle line:90%
down about 50 percent right now.

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:54.858 align:middle line:84%
But you have fisheries
crashing, you had the--

00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:57.194 align:middle line:84%
the sardine industry off the
Pacific Northwest Coast came

00:49:57.194 --> 00:49:58.195 align:middle line:90%
back with nothing.

00:49:58.195 --> 00:49:59.696 align:middle line:90%
No fish at all.

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:01.432 align:middle line:84%
We have marine animals dying
all over the California Coast

00:50:01.432 --> 00:50:03.467 align:middle line:84%
that the bottom of the
food chain is collapsing.

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:04.835 align:middle line:90%
You have krill populations

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.704 align:middle line:84%
in the southern ocean
are down 80 percent.

00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:11.308 align:middle line:84%
So, we have literally
oceans imploding right now.

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:13.377 align:middle line:84%
They're acidifying as
I mentioned earlier.

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:15.079 align:middle line:84%
And as you have methane
release there's a lot of reasons

00:50:15.079 --> 00:50:18.882 align:middle line:84%
for the acidification because
we have obviously the CO2

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.451 align:middle line:84%
absorption that's
building up all the time.

00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:24.021 align:middle line:84%
But as methane hydrate
migrates from the seafloor,

00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:25.522 align:middle line:84%
this is frozen methane
for people

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:28.459 align:middle line:84%
who don't know what it is,
Bermuda Triangle, ship sinkings,

00:50:28.459 --> 00:50:29.827 align:middle line:90%
these are methane releases.

00:50:29.827 --> 00:50:31.061 align:middle line:90%
We know this now.

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:33.263 align:middle line:84%
These are fields of methane
frozen on a seafloor.

00:50:33.263 --> 00:50:35.232 align:middle line:84%
If they warm up a
little, they release.

00:50:35.232 --> 00:50:38.235 align:middle line:84%
So, we have mass releases now
appearing all over the Arctic.

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:41.405 align:middle line:84%
This methane as it migrates from
the seafloor to the surface,

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:44.141 align:middle line:84%
it acidifies the ocean
when it hits the surface

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:45.576 align:middle line:84%
and it migrates into
the atmosphere.

00:50:45.576 --> 00:50:49.113 align:middle line:84%
It starts to cover the
planet like a layer of glass.

00:50:49.113 --> 00:50:52.816 align:middle line:84%
In the case of methane,
you'll often hear to it

00:50:52.816 --> 00:50:55.185 align:middle line:84%
being refered to, Regina, as
being 20 times more potent

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:58.355 align:middle line:90%
than CO2 as a greenhouse gas.

00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:00.491 align:middle line:84%
That's over a 100-year
time horizon.

00:51:00.491 --> 00:51:02.426 align:middle line:84%
Over a 20-year or
10-year time horizon,

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:04.795 align:middle line:84%
methane is a hundred
times more potent.

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:08.932 align:middle line:84%
So, all this feeds on
itself again, as the--

00:51:08.932 --> 00:51:11.201 align:middle line:84%
as warming occurs, more plankton
dies, you have more anoxic zones

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:15.706 align:middle line:90%
in the ocean, oxygen free zones.

00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:17.975 align:middle line:90%
So, you have more die-off.

00:51:17.975 --> 00:51:20.644 align:middle line:84%
You know, everything
starts to feed on itself.

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:23.147 align:middle line:84%
So, at this point,
we're seeing also

00:51:23.147 --> 00:51:27.017 align:middle line:84%
hydrogen sulfide could start
to result from methane release.

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:29.653 align:middle line:84%
And hydrogen sulfide
is heavier than air.

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:30.954 align:middle line:90%
Methane is lighter than air.

00:51:30.954 --> 00:51:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So, hydrogen sulfide can
settle on the surface

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:34.625 align:middle line:90%
and actually be ignited.

00:51:34.625 --> 00:51:37.161 align:middle line:84%
So, with the degree of release,
the amount of methane stored

00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:40.731 align:middle line:84%
in the arctic right now is
enough to eliminate life

00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:43.734 align:middle line:90%
on earth a number of times over.

00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:47.371 align:middle line:84%
And the effect in the oceans
is happening right now.

00:51:47.371 --> 00:51:48.805 align:middle line:84%
And people really
should look at this.

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:51.241 align:middle line:84%
The oceans are actually
imploding, the methane blooms

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:54.077 align:middle line:84%
are a sign of that.
We have jellyfish,

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've perhaps seen the
jellyfish explosions happening

00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.384 align:middle line:84%
around or population explosions
happening around the world.

00:52:00.384 --> 00:52:01.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the
die-off of a lot

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:05.889 align:middle line:84%
of marine life including
more land based marine life

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:08.692 align:middle line:84%
such as some of the
seals and so forth.

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:11.595 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is extending
all the way on to the shore.

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:14.131 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's affecting porpoises,
it's affecting everything.

00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:16.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: You might-- I
don't know if you saw the--

00:52:16.099 --> 00:52:20.304 align:middle line:84%
they just recovered a two
headed gray whale from somewhere

00:52:20.304 --> 00:52:21.672 align:middle line:84%
in Baja which is
quite astounding.

00:52:21.672 --> 00:52:24.041 align:middle line:84%
The pictures are available
online now but as far

00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:27.311 align:middle line:84%
as overall species extinction,
these are not disputed.

00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:30.314 align:middle line:84%
We're losing some
200 species a day,

00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:34.518 align:middle line:90%
right now, plant and animal.

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:37.321 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
like to believe

00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:41.191 align:middle line:84%
that this is normal somehow
that species always go extinct.

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:42.426 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:52:42.426 --> 00:52:45.095 align:middle line:84%
But this is how abnormal
this equation is.

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:50.033 align:middle line:84%
200 species a day is 10,000
times background extinction

00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:52.869 align:middle line:84%
rates, which is a
million percent of normal.

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:54.538 align:middle line:84%
So, there's nothing
usual about that.

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:56.340 align:middle line:84%
We are in the 6th
great mass extinction

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:58.208 align:middle line:90%
on planet earth right now.

00:52:58.208 --> 00:53:02.646 align:middle line:84%
And there's data right now
on current trajectories

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:07.217 align:middle line:84%
that indicate if we stay on this
track, in a very short time,

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:08.285 align:middle line:84%
a decade or two,
this planet will be

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:10.687 align:middle line:90%
completely unrecognizable.

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:13.323 align:middle line:84%
And people need to wake up to
the fact that this is not going

00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:14.691 align:middle line:90%
to go away if they ignore it.

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:17.928 align:middle line:84%
We have a fast track to a
planet that has no life.

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:18.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You know,

00:53:18.996 --> 00:53:21.698 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing a
man named Ken Rohla.

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:26.136 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying something
that's kind of interesting.

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:31.642 align:middle line:84%
As dire as all of these, not
just sounds but actually is,

00:53:31.642 --> 00:53:35.445 align:middle line:84%
he was saying that the
beauty of life is somehow

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:37.714 align:middle line:90%
as the problem surfaces also

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:40.517 align:middle line:84%
so do the solutions
at the same time.

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:43.186 align:middle line:84%
And so, he was giving us
an indication in terms

00:53:43.186 --> 00:53:47.691 align:middle line:84%
of chemtrails for example
of some of the solutions,

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:51.595 align:middle line:84%
there's some newer technologies
that are being experimented

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:54.765 align:middle line:84%
with right now that might
have the capacity to kind

00:53:54.765 --> 00:53:57.734 align:middle line:84%
of take the wind out of
the effects of chemtrails.

00:53:57.734 --> 00:54:00.170 align:middle line:90%
But there also is consciousness.

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:02.839 align:middle line:84%
There's the consciousness
piece of it unless we go

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:04.908 align:middle line:90%
to esoteric in that direction.

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:08.178 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about the common
consciousness surrounding all

00:54:08.178 --> 00:54:12.182 align:middle line:84%
of this because obviously,
we are the solution.

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:15.385 align:middle line:84%
And if you would go on in
some length about this--

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:18.021 align:middle line:84%
what we can-- and we hear this
and we think it's overwhelming,

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:21.692 align:middle line:84%
they don't-- it's a black budget
project all over the globe.

00:54:21.692 --> 00:54:23.460 align:middle line:84%
No one can stop them,
no one knows

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.228 align:middle line:84%
where they take off
from or land.

00:54:25.228 --> 00:54:27.964 align:middle line:84%
You can't stop these airplanes,
they have young kids flying

00:54:27.964 --> 00:54:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and we think they're doing
some good in the world.

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.835 align:middle line:90%
They're just members

00:54:31.835 --> 00:54:34.371 align:middle line:84%
of the military doing their
duty thinking they're helping

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:36.106 align:middle line:90%
with weather modification.

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:39.242 align:middle line:84%
Again, unless we shake our fist
at the sky and wish them poorly,

00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:42.913 align:middle line:84%
which I've certainly
done in the early years.

00:54:42.913 --> 00:54:44.448 align:middle line:84%
These kids don't know
what they're doing.

00:54:44.448 --> 00:54:47.150 align:middle line:84%
These pilots for the most part
don't know the implications

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.385 align:middle line:90%
of what they were doing.

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:50.387 align:middle line:84%
So, let's look at the
consciousness piece of this

00:54:50.387 --> 00:54:51.955 align:middle line:90%
and our responsibility.

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:54.591 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: You're exactly
right in your assessment

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:56.660 align:middle line:84%
of why these programs
can be carried out.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.763 align:middle line:84%
And to clarify that
or add a little to it,

00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:02.966 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to a KC-135
pilot, a young man,

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:06.002 align:middle line:84%
did not know what he
was doing up there

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:08.372 align:middle line:84%
and after learning
a bit, he went back

00:55:08.372 --> 00:55:09.906 align:middle line:90%
and started to ask questions.

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:12.209 align:middle line:84%
And the last news I got from
him was he was medicated behind

00:55:12.209 --> 00:55:13.343 align:middle line:90%
the desk.

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:15.412 align:middle line:84%
So that's what happens
when you ask questions.

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:18.982 align:middle line:84%
But on raising consciousness,
this is a shining example

00:55:18.982 --> 00:55:21.685 align:middle line:90%
of why our greatest goal is

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:24.354 align:middle line:84%
to simply bring these
programs to light.

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:27.057 align:middle line:84%
This is another reason
why I focus so exclusively

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:31.995 align:middle line:84%
on this issue because it's the
most destructive single issue

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:34.898 align:middle line:84%
on the planet and it is also
the most catalyzing issue.

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:36.733 align:middle line:84%
Because people from
every political strife,

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:39.403 align:middle line:84%
from every background, from
every belief, when they know

00:55:39.403 --> 00:55:45.242 align:middle line:84%
that they have been exposed to
experiment of this magnitude

00:55:45.242 --> 00:55:48.044 align:middle line:84%
and treated as a lab
rat, people unite.

00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:50.881 align:middle line:84%
And I have had support
now from everybody

00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:53.016 align:middle line:84%
from the Green Party
to the Tea Party.

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:54.017 align:middle line:90%
They joined hands on this issue.

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:56.253 align:middle line:90%
And we simply must join hands.

00:55:56.253 --> 00:55:59.489 align:middle line:84%
This issue must be dealt with
where nothing else will matter.

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:02.125 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how dark
the horizon looks,

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:05.729 align:middle line:84%
and it does indeed look dark,
if we could bring this one issue

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:08.265 align:middle line:90%
to light and expose it, it would

00:56:08.265 --> 00:56:11.168 align:middle line:84%
so radically change the
composition of what we face.

00:56:11.168 --> 00:56:14.171 align:middle line:84%
It would drag so many other
issues with it, it would unite

00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:18.074 align:middle line:84%
so many people that quite
simply this is the battle

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:21.378 align:middle line:84%
that we must focus
on above all others

00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:24.448 align:middle line:84%
or we will not have the capacity
to deal with anything else

00:56:24.448 --> 00:56:28.318 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be too afraid
and splintered as a society

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:29.653 align:middle line:90%
to deal with anything else.

00:56:29.653 --> 00:56:31.054 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I have
focused all in this issue

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.622 align:middle line:84%
because it brings people
together in a common cause

00:56:32.622 --> 00:56:35.725 align:middle line:84%
and we must have
that at this time.

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:37.694 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Is there-- are
there any sympathetic ears,

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:40.163 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever in DC for example

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:43.333 align:middle line:84%
or in the European
Parliament, or anywhere?

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:46.837 align:middle line:84%
And then, let's talk about the
China, Russia factor in this.

00:56:46.837 --> 00:56:48.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: All good points.

00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:53.643 align:middle line:84%
Yes. There are some-- a very
concerned Congressional people.

00:56:53.643 --> 00:56:55.579 align:middle line:84%
I communicate with
several of them.

00:56:55.579 --> 00:56:58.782 align:middle line:84%
I think it is in the point right
now where each does not want

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:00.851 align:middle line:84%
to be the only one in the
room with their sword drawn--

00:57:00.851 --> 00:57:01.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I understand.

00:57:01.852 --> 00:57:02.586 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: -- if you will.

00:57:02.586 --> 00:57:03.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:04.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: They're
trying to unite.

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:06.122 align:middle line:90%
So-- and that's coming.

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:11.361 align:middle line:84%
And the-- some of the other
organizations that, again,

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:13.630 align:middle line:90%
I would say one of the most--

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.399 align:middle line:84%
one of the least
helpful organizations

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:17.667 align:middle line:84%
or groups right now is
the environmental groups.

00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:20.904 align:middle line:90%
They will not face this issue.

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:25.141 align:middle line:84%
They seem very comfortable
in their current trajectory

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:26.443 align:middle line:84%
and whether there's
funding issues

00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:28.478 align:middle line:84%
that are keeping them
from addressing this.

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:32.582 align:middle line:84%
We're trying also with a lot
of the religious institutions

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:35.485 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of the spiritual
institutions to address this.

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:38.021 align:middle line:84%
I think some of their tax-free
status is keeping some of them

00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:39.489 align:middle line:90%
from getting involved.

00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:41.992 align:middle line:84%
That's a tragedy because the
whole ship is going down.

00:57:41.992 --> 00:57:44.427 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we need all these
organizations to get involved.

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:48.431 align:middle line:84%
But they're-- yes, there is
Congressional concerns growing

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:53.069 align:middle line:84%
and trying to be-- we're
trying to unite those people.

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:55.739 align:middle line:84%
On the China, Russia
part-- your question--

00:57:55.739 --> 00:57:57.707 align:middle line:84%
this is what makes the
equation even more complex

00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:59.709 align:middle line:84%
because China has
mainstream media,

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:02.078 align:middle line:90%
Russia has mainstream media,

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:04.481 align:middle line:84%
but they're both involved
in these programs.

00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:08.652 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's difficult
to bring them to light

00:58:08.652 --> 00:58:10.086 align:middle line:90%
because even though they're--

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:11.555 align:middle line:84%
there's probably military
strategic opposition going

00:58:11.555 --> 00:58:15.058 align:middle line:84%
on here, nobody wants to
shine the light on the other

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.893 align:middle line:84%
because then it will
shine on them.

00:58:16.893 --> 00:58:19.996 align:middle line:84%
So, this makes the equation
worse than our atmosphere

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:21.698 align:middle line:84%
because we literally
in addition to--

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.733 align:middle line:90%
with all the various reasons

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.735 align:middle line:84%
that they're manipulating
the atmosphere,

00:58:25.735 --> 00:58:28.705 align:middle line:84%
we have virtually
opposing forces pulling

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:30.373 align:middle line:90%
on the atmosphere now as well.

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:32.976 align:middle line:84%
And we can't begin to
separate who's doing what.

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:35.645 align:middle line:84%
And once the system is
derailed as much as it is now,

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:37.714 align:middle line:84%
we don't know what the causal
factors are completely.

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:39.382 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a--

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:41.618 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:44.187 align:middle line:84%
If you have the US with their
particular agendas using HAARP

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot to drive
these storms around

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.192 align:middle line:84%
and create these
various disasters.

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:52.162 align:middle line:84%
And then you have China,
Russia, other countries doing

00:58:52.162 --> 00:58:55.298 align:middle line:84%
that for their own purposes,
I mean there's only so much

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:58.368 align:middle line:84%
to work with in terms of what
would have been natural weather

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:00.804 align:middle line:84%
patterns, moisture
patterns, and so forth.

00:59:00.804 --> 00:59:02.772 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't really thought
about that.

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:05.175 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
they're all competing

00:59:05.175 --> 00:59:08.111 align:middle line:84%
for maybe some of
the same terrain?

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:09.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: And
indeed they are.

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:14.517 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know what happens
but what we see right now is

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:19.489 align:middle line:84%
as alarming as it could be,
again, that feedback mechanisms.

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:21.658 align:middle line:84%
And for those who don't know
what a feedback mechanism is,

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:24.728 align:middle line:84%
once you start this ball
rolling, you can't stop it.

00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:27.297 align:middle line:84%
In the case of methane, I'll
give that example again is

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.432 align:middle line:84%
that they've diverted
the jet stream,

00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:31.601 align:middle line:84%
they pumped cold air south
like what they just did.

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:34.037 align:middle line:84%
They take a huge chunk of
Artic air, push it south,

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:36.006 align:middle line:84%
create a cold anomaly,
make a bunch of headlines.

00:59:36.006 --> 00:59:37.440 align:middle line:84%
But that air came
from somewhere.

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:38.441 align:middle line:90%
It came from the Arctic.

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:40.243 align:middle line:84%
So that causes heating
in the Artic.

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:41.645 align:middle line:84%
Well, then it was
so cold in the US,

00:59:41.645 --> 00:59:43.880 align:middle line:84%
it was above normal temperatures
in the Artic by far.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.383 align:middle line:84%
That increases the
ocean temperatures

00:59:46.383 --> 00:59:48.318 align:middle line:84%
as they shred the ozone
with these programs.

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:50.286 align:middle line:84%
We have even further
ocean heating

00:59:50.286 --> 00:59:52.722 align:middle line:84%
because of this intense
radiation that causes methane

00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:55.191 align:middle line:84%
to release that heats
the atmosphere

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:56.593 align:middle line:90%
that causes even more heating.

00:59:56.593 --> 00:59:58.128 align:middle line:90%
It all feeds on itself.

00:59:58.128 --> 01:00:03.266 align:middle line:84%
So as all these opposing forces
push and pull on the system,

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.768 align:middle line:90%
only bad things can happen.

01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:06.736 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what we're seeing.

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:10.974 align:middle line:84%
And really the-- people tend to
think in linear terms, Regina,

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:13.643 align:middle line:84%
that if it took 200 years
of industrial civilization

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to get us this far, we have
this much time in front of us.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.183 align:middle line:84%
You can't take a graph looking
backward and project it forward.

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:24.020 align:middle line:84%
We are in a very, very
nonlinear equation.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.889 align:middle line:84%
The speed at which
the climate system

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:29.025 align:middle line:84%
and earth's life support
systems are imploding is

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:30.293 align:middle line:90%
absolutely blinding.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:32.295 align:middle line:84%
People need to wake
up in this issue fast

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:34.631 align:middle line:90%
because time is not on our side.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:35.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Indeed.

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:37.901 align:middle line:84%
And let's get down to
some of the real basics

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:40.203 align:middle line:90%
of our own food supplies now.

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:43.840 align:middle line:84%
People are going to have to take
increasing self responsibility

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.208 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to food.

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:48.011 align:middle line:84%
That's been obvious for
the last decade at least.

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:51.481 align:middle line:84%
The people that I know who
are more or less in the know

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.849 align:middle line:84%
on these subjects
have turned to growing

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:55.885 align:middle line:90%
in greenhouses for example.

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:58.221 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk a little
bit about that?

01:00:58.221 --> 01:01:00.924 align:middle line:84%
And also, we should just
probably add in there

01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:03.626 align:middle line:84%
that our great savior,
the one who shall come

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:08.598 align:middle line:84%
to our rescue is-- if they have
their way would be Monsanto.

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:09.766 align:middle line:90%
They have applied for patents

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:12.836 align:middle line:84%
for aluminum resistant
seeds and crops.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.204 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:16.206 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: They have
aluminum resistant seeds,

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:19.075 align:middle line:84%
drought resistant,
and now UV resistant.

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:19.876 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, UV.

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: So--

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:21.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:23.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Yes, they
do because, you know,

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:24.214 align:middle line:84%
they certainly know
what's happening

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:25.648 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere,
what's being done.

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:28.685 align:middle line:84%
And they tried-- they're
disaster capitalists and they

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:33.256 align:middle line:84%
try to reap a profit off of
anything that happens.

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.024 align:middle line:90%
But I would carry this further

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.559 align:middle line:84%
that no matter what
Monsanto does,

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:39.562 align:middle line:84%
that they are not a primary
player in this instance.

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:41.765 align:middle line:84%
They're simply a buzzard
feasting on the carrion--

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:42.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:43.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: And
that the big picture--

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.268 align:middle line:90%
it's much more dire.

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:48.071 align:middle line:84%
Those that are really
pulling the levers understand

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:50.073 align:middle line:84%
that the ship is
going down right now.

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:53.143 align:middle line:84%
They're digging in-- that
they're stocking bunkers.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:56.079 align:middle line:84%
We know this because we
contacted actually Mountain

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:59.082 align:middle line:84%
House Foods who had all their
retail production on hold

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.917 align:middle line:84%
to supply the government
for a very long time.

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:03.586 align:middle line:84%
So they-- they're
stocking their bunkers up

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:06.623 align:middle line:84%
and we see homeland security
order 2.2 billion rounds

01:02:06.623 --> 01:02:07.991 align:middle line:90%
of 40 caliber hollow point.

01:02:07.991 --> 01:02:10.193 align:middle line:84%
That should be a very
scary red flag for people.

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:11.694 align:middle line:84%
So they're preparing
for societal collapse.

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:14.731 align:middle line:84%
At the point in time when
there's not enough food

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:18.501 align:middle line:84%
to go around, and we are getting
very near that point in time.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's resource
disruption.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:24.908 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Middle East
issues the increased unfolding

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:27.577 align:middle line:84%
of or unraveling
of societies there.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.279 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's simply
not enough to go around.

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:30.947 align:middle line:84%
And that will escalate
very rapidly.

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:35.518 align:middle line:84%
So again, the immediacy of our
situation needs to be considered

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:37.754 align:middle line:84%
and also the psychotic
nature of those in power

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:41.691 align:middle line:84%
who think they can go into a
hole and hide and ride this out.

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:44.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, Bill Gates
for example sent, what,

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:47.764 align:middle line:84%
40 million dollars or
something on seedbank--

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.066 align:middle line:90%
the seedbank in the Arctic?

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:52.902 align:middle line:84%
I mean who's that being
done on behalf of?

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:54.871 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Doomsday
seed vault.

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:56.472 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And that's--
you know this--

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:58.041 align:middle line:84%
it shows their mentality
though again,

01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:01.311 align:middle line:84%
I mean that they feel they can
with their power, their money,

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:04.214 align:middle line:84%
their control that they
can attack their way

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:06.449 align:middle line:84%
and buy their way
out of any situation.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:09.085 align:middle line:84%
In previous methane
mass extinctions

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:11.654 align:middle line:84%
that are probably
much less significant

01:03:11.654 --> 01:03:14.724 align:middle line:84%
than what is now unfolding,
we had mass extinction

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:19.262 align:middle line:84%
at the Paleocene-Eocene
55 million years ago,

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:22.565 align:middle line:84%
about 70 plus percent
terrestrial extinction

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and about 95 percent ocean
extinction, this event looks

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:29.272 align:middle line:90%
like it could be worse.

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:31.207 align:middle line:84%
The equilibrium period,
this is what's important.

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:33.309 align:middle line:84%
The equilibrium period
after such an event,

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:36.579 align:middle line:84%
10 to 20 million years, you
can't stand and hold that long.

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.982 align:middle line:84%
We simply can't let this unfold
in the direction it's going--

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:40.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No we cannot.

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: -- that the
planet must be allowed

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:44.287 align:middle line:90%
to respond on its own.

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:49.425 align:middle line:84%
And if it can't respond,
then all will be lost.

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:51.327 align:middle line:84%
So quite simply, we're
back to geoengineering

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:52.829 align:middle line:90%
as being a primary focus.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You just mentioned
the people behind this,

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:57.667 align:middle line:84%
you know, who are at
least sociopathic who--

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:01.704 align:middle line:84%
you know, you have the military,
you have DARPA, you have DoD,

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:05.208 align:middle line:84%
you have all of these
agencies globally.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.377 align:middle line:90%
There is something beyond that.

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:10.380 align:middle line:84%
There is something
that's orchestrating it.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.515 align:middle line:90%
What do you think that might be?

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Well, I
think if you look back

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.119 align:middle line:84%
at the progression
that's got us here,

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:21.858 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we see anything
that's not typical psychopathic

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.159 align:middle line:90%
human behavior.

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:24.594 align:middle line:84%
Those with certain
tendencies end up in power

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.596 align:middle line:84%
because they'll do things
that the rest of us won't.

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:30.934 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, their power is
so total and so extensive that--

01:04:30.934 --> 01:04:32.468 align:middle line:84%
and with-- and coupled
with technology,

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.504 align:middle line:90%
it's a very lethal recipe.

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:38.474 align:middle line:84%
So as they've continued
to do damage to the planet

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
by orchestrating these
systems for example in regard

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.878 align:middle line:84%
to geoengineering, the
more damage they do,

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:45.615 align:middle line:84%
the more they try to
increase their control.

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:48.251 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of the
pharmaceutical approach

01:04:48.251 --> 01:04:49.719 align:middle line:90%
to planet earth, you know.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:52.455 align:middle line:84%
If they want to control one
aspect, they do one thing,

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:55.325 align:middle line:84%
it triggers 20 other things,
they try to control that.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:58.027 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, the
consequences are total

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:00.897 align:middle line:84%
and quite simply, too many
people in our society think

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:04.267 align:middle line:84%
that if they ignore
what's happening and go

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.536 align:middle line:84%
about their own personal
pursuits of pleasure

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:08.705 align:middle line:90%
that such problems will go away.

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:09.706 align:middle line:90%
This will not go away.

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:10.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This one's
not going away.

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:12.542 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:13.343 align:middle line:90%
We have kids.

01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:14.811 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have grand kids.

01:05:14.811 --> 01:05:17.013 align:middle line:84%
We have brothers and sisters
and friends that we love.

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:20.383 align:middle line:84%
We have to find ways to contend
with this on personal levels

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:21.951 align:middle line:84%
as well as politically
active levels.

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:25.088 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me one of the
best things we could do is

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.557 align:middle line:90%
when you do get a clear day

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:29.892 align:middle line:84%
on those rare wonderful
clear blue sky days.

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:33.896 align:middle line:84%
We need to go out and really
spend some time with nature

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:35.264 align:middle line:90%
and under the sun for one.

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:36.666 align:middle line:90%
That's just a simple thing.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:39.135 align:middle line:84%
But we need it on more
than one level, I think.

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:41.471 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: We do.

01:05:41.471 --> 01:05:43.139 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see less
and less sun because again,

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:45.174 align:middle line:84%
the reason I've focused
a certain amount

01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:48.978 align:middle line:84%
of my dissemination on
what damage has been done

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:51.914 align:middle line:84%
to the climate is because that's
very immediately affecting our

01:05:51.914 --> 01:05:57.720 align:middle line:84%
current crisis and that the
wrapping of a spring we seen

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.490 align:middle line:84%
in recent months
is very extensive

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and every time there is
worst news out of the Arctic,

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:07.497 align:middle line:84%
the methane spikes, and let
me put this into context.

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Methane for-- methane
in the atmosphere,

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.703 align:middle line:84%
CH4 for the last million
years before the industrial

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.237 align:middle line:84%
revolution, it never got
above 700 parts per billion.

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's spikes up to
2600 parts per billion.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.342 align:middle line:90%
It's going through the roof.

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.611 align:middle line:90%
And what do the geoengineers do?

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:23.846 align:middle line:90%
They just simply spray more.

01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:25.782 align:middle line:84%
If something is not
working in their mind

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:28.251 align:middle line:84%
and with their mentality, you're
just not doing enough of it.

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So, we're not going to see
as much of that blue sky

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.955 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned
that we all need.

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:34.524 align:middle line:90%
We do need it.

01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:35.992 align:middle line:84%
But in a certain point in time,
I mean, we're seeing very little

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:40.530 align:middle line:84%
of it now and this is
going to get rapidly worst.

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:45.168 align:middle line:84%
So, our crisis this year, it's
now-- and I think, if people,

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:48.938 align:middle line:84%
if they really truly
want to do something

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.240 align:middle line:90%
for the common good, this is it.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.042 align:middle line:84%
If they care about their
children, this is it.

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:56.879 align:middle line:84%
This is the battle we must win
first before we will be able

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:58.748 align:middle line:84%
to address the other
challenges we've faced.

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:02.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, we're wrapping
it up, Dane, specifically,

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:06.022 align:middle line:84%
people watching this who
want to do something now,

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:10.159 align:middle line:84%
what can they do that will be
the most effective thing toward

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:11.461 align:middle line:90%
that end.

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:12.628 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: This is
the most important part

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:16.766 align:middle line:90%
of this type of information.

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:19.202 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can play
a profound part

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:22.905 align:middle line:84%
to help this issue
come to light.

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:26.676 align:middle line:84%
When you share this with other
people, don't go into a rant--

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:28.044 align:middle line:90%
run outside, pointed the sky

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.513 align:middle line:84%
that just completely puts
people's defenses up.

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:32.815 align:middle line:84%
Have something credible
to pass on.

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:36.452 align:middle line:84%
We have fliers on the front
of geoengineeringwatch.org

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:38.821 align:middle line:84%
that people can download
and print.

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:42.892 align:middle line:84%
This is a thought out
polished flyer two-sided.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:46.696 align:middle line:84%
We send them out for the cost
of production for those flyers

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:49.232 align:middle line:84%
for people who can't print
them but have a credible flyer

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
to pass on, have a
good DVD.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.338 align:middle line:90%
There's a site skyderalert.com

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:57.607 align:middle line:84%
and this is an interactive
downloadable site

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:59.208 align:middle line:84%
that helps alert
your politicians

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.743 align:middle line:84%
to what you're seeing
in the sky.

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.211 align:middle line:90%
That's a good resource as well.

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:03.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Say the
name of it again.

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%
The name of that site.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:08.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: It's
skyderalert.com.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:10.353 align:middle line:90%
S-K-Y-D-E-R ALERT dot com.

01:08:10.353 --> 01:08:11.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:13.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: So, a
film called "Look Up"

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.324 align:middle line:90%
by filmmaker George Barnes.

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:16.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Narrative
of involvement.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.294 align:middle line:90%
I think you seen that.

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:19.027 align:middle line:90%
That's another good tool.

01:08:19.027 --> 01:08:20.129 align:middle line:90%
So, have DVDs.

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:21.964 align:middle line:90%
Have credible data to pass on so

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.933 align:middle line:84%
that you're not just
going into a rant.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:27.837 align:middle line:84%
And people to help us expose
this issue also find groups,

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.071 align:middle line:84%
organizations, individuals
that would care if they knew.

01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:32.441 align:middle line:84%
Send them credible
data, credible message,

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.576 align:middle line:84%
shoot flaming arrows
of information

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:35.811 align:middle line:84%
so we can help bring
this to light.

01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:38.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And then
finally, under-- we've--

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:40.917 align:middle line:84%
we're searching YouTube for
the video that I watched

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:44.053 align:middle line:84%
that I said in-- well, it's
something like 46 or 50 minutes,

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:47.690 align:middle line:84%
you encapsulated all the
credible parts of the story.

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:49.357 align:middle line:90%
What is the name of that video?

01:08:49.357 --> 01:08:50.726 align:middle line:90%
What's that titled under?

01:08:50.726 --> 01:08:52.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: It's called
the most important topic

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.329 align:middle line:90%
of our time.

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:54.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, OK.

01:08:54.696 --> 01:08:56.232 align:middle line:84%
And I highly encourage
everyone to look at that.

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: And
I will be doing--

01:08:57.533 --> 01:09:01.003 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing another
updated live presentation

01:09:01.003 --> 01:09:04.207 align:middle line:84%
that will be even more concise
and hard hitting in a week.

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:05.607 align:middle line:84%
We'll post that afterwards
as well.

01:09:05.607 --> 01:09:08.643 align:middle line:84%
Our only goal is to give
people the tools they need

01:09:08.643 --> 01:09:10.379 align:middle line:84%
to educate others
as fast as possible.

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.883 align:middle line:90%
And your website again?

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:16.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington:
Geoengineeringwatch.org.

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.187 align:middle line:84%
>> Wigington: Dane, I can't
thank you enough for a decade

01:09:19.187 --> 01:09:22.258 align:middle line:84%
of your life spent very, very
well on the behalf of all of us.

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:25.861 align:middle line:84%
I particularly appreciate it
because I find this such an,

01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.396 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is the most
important topic right now.

01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:30.665 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much for
your time today as well.

01:09:30.665 --> 01:09:31.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Wigington: Thank you Regina.

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:34.971 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for giving
this cause a voice.

01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:37.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I agree that
this is a serious in issues

01:09:37.073 --> 01:09:39.741 align:middle line:84%
as we've just indicated
and there are solutions.

01:09:39.741 --> 01:09:42.812 align:middle line:84%
