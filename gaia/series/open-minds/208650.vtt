>> Once I found that I could get
new insights into the natural

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.090 align:middle line:84%
systems that life is based on,
it really got me onto the path

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.920 align:middle line:90%
of the sacred geometry work.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.560 align:middle line:84%
What sacred geometry is
is a modern term for what

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times would
have been understanding

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:84%
the key to everything, because
once you know the pattern,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
that gives you power
over the thing.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.030 align:middle line:84%
People will often begin to
recognize the different levels

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:84%
of subconscious motivation
that is condemning

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
them to repeat the same
problems in relationship

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:90%
after relationship.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
But you have to do
a pattern interrupt.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Are we supporting the other
person's freedom or are

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
we basing the
relationship on, "I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
want you to be the
person I'm casting

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:90%
in this role in my psychodrama?"

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It's really easy through
the reactive mind

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to start wanting to
manipulate other people.

Robert Gilbert, who is
now featured on Gaia

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:84%
with his new show
"Sacred Geometry"

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:84%
is here to give
us a taste of how

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.930 align:middle line:84%
we can use geometry
to strengthen

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:90%
and empower our lives.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
We'll be advancing our previous
conversation by digging

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:90%
deeper into sacred patterns.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.233 align:middle line:90%
So welcome back, Robert.

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT GILBERT: Thank you.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

>>REGINA: A really big part
of what you're doing right now

00:01:33.797 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:90%
is pattern recognition.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is
something that is not

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.640 align:middle line:84%
just useful, but kind of
necessary for our involvement

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.743 align:middle line:84%
as individuals in
society, right?

00:01:44.743 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think one of the
biggest problems humanity

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.520 align:middle line:84%
has is we keep repeating
the same mistakes, right?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a lot
of that right now.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to begin our
conversation first of all

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.760 align:middle line:84%
by just a little bit
about your background

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:84%
once again because it
was an interesting way

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:90%
to back into bio geometry.

US Marine Corps instructor
in the nuclear, biological,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:90%
chemical, defense field.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:84%
One would not think
of that as someone

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
who's going to take up the
mantle of an instructor

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:90%
in sacred geometry.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So just give us a little
background again on that.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: OK.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:10%
So in the early 1980s, I
joined the US Marine Corps

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:10%
and I was made an
instructor, as you mentioned,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:10%
in the nuclear, biological,
chemical defense field.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, that basically deals with
the practical applications

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
of physics, biology,
and chemistry,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:84%
but unfortunately, in a
very negative way basically

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
to create weapons
of mass destruction.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.018 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: And I was
on the defense side,

00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:84%
so I was teaching people how to
survive in battlefields where

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:90%
these things could be deployed.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.780 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I became
interested in understanding

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:84%
more about how do
we antidote things

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
like the exposure we have
every day to radiation,

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:84%
the exposure we have
to toxic chemicals,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the biological agents
that we're exposed to.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:84%
These are things that are
always dangerous for humanity.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And in my own research
in it, I found

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the
scientific discussions of it

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
are very abstract for people,
and many people simply

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
can't connect to the
scientific studies

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
because they're based on very
dense algebraic equations.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And most people still have some
type of post-traumatic stress

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.880 align:middle line:90%
syndrome from high school--

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.922 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Raise my hand--

00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:90%
algebra.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: --in
dealing with math.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to go there.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: But I
found that there

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
was a whole series of
scientific documents

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:84%
that had been created by
organizations like NATO that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
study natural systems
based on pure geometry,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:90%
based on pure shape.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And so when it's based on
pure shape and geometry,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
you can see the pattern
directly that all these things

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.140 align:middle line:90%
are based on.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
people could absorb

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:90%
that almost instantaneously.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was applying
to counter-terrorism type

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:84%
of antidotes or to the
actual weapons themselves,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:84%
the chemicals
themselves, all things

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:84%
going back to these same
simple geometrical symbols

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:90%
or patterns?

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: Everything
is based on a pattern.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at a
basic chemistry textbook,

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:84%
you'll see these
particular diagrams

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
where they're showing
many geometries that

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:84%
would have been recognized
in the old Greek school 2,500

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
years ago or in Egypt
even before that

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
as classical patterns
rediscovered in modern times

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that all of these natural
systems are based on.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And so once we began to
understand in modern science

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and technology that the
knowledge of the ancients

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:84%
of these types of patterns
are what's being rediscovered

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:84%
in modern scientific
research and technology,

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that's what really
got me on this path.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Once I found that I
could get new insights

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.710 align:middle line:84%
into the natural systems
that life is based on,

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
based on pure geometry and
how well people responded

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:84%
to having it taught
to them that way

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:84%
rather than in
dense mathematics,

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
it really got me onto the path
of the sacred geometry work.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
take that further

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:84%
when I left the Marine
Corps and I got my PhD

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.645 align:middle line:90%
in International Studies.

00:05:15.645 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Because in the time in
International Studies,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I could study classical
systems all around the world

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and how they and their
advanced healing,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:84%
advanced spiritual
practices would

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.940 align:middle line:84%
apply various types of geometric
patterns, which in many cases

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
overlap with the patterns
you find in modern science

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And then from there I began
to teach publicly the research

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I done to connect modern
science and technology directly

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.430 align:middle line:84%
with the same pattern to
ancient spiritual teachings

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and began to teach
sacred geometry.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And then around the year
2000, I met Dr. Ibrahim Karim

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
from Cairo, Egypt, who's
the founder of biogeometry.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And biogeometry, in terms
of what people in the West

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
think of a sacred
geometry, biogeometry could

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:84%
be thought of as the
hidden lost energy science

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:84%
inside of sacred
geometry that you almost

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.380 align:middle line:84%
never hear about
anymore, but was really

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
the heart of the
ancient sacred geometry.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And so biogeometry is really
nature's design language,

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
how nature uses shape,
sound, color, motion, angle

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.090 align:middle line:84%
proportion, number to be able to
create everything in the world

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and create the very specific
vibratory characteristics based

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:90%
on those quality scales.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
background at which

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming toward the
work in sacred geometry

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and really emphasizing
the pattern recognition,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes sacred
geometry is taught

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that it
can be very heady, very

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:84%
intellectual, or very
connected to a lot of math

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that, although very
useful in that form,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:84%
many people don't really
connect to it in that way.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand
sacred geometry

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:84%
as the recognition of the
patterns of everything

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
in our life, including
our emotional life,

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
our relationships,
our diet, as well

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
as advanced spiritual
practices-- who am I?

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.370 align:middle line:84%
What can I do with my limited
time in my life on Earth

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.120 align:middle line:84%
to actually move ahead
in spiritual evolution?

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:84%
All these things are based
on pattern recognition.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.925 align:middle line:84%
And as we said,
this is something

00:07:16.925 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:84%
that we would probably
do well to invest

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.992 align:middle line:90%
our a little energy into.

00:07:19.992 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And as you're talking
every now and then,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll go off on a goofy little
foray, a little esoteric foray.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:84%
But when you were talking
about all things being

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.520 align:middle line:84%
made from these elements, I
was having a meditation one

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:84%
time based on the
nature of manifestation

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:90%
into physical reality.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was showing that in
the upper dimensional fields,

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and you could almost align
them with the chakras

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
above the head, in three
tiers above the head,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that from the point
of the thought,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:84%
the thought of the desired thing
outcome whatever, it showed how

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
exactly what you're
talking about what

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:84%
stage the geometry and
the numerics came in,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and the light and
the color came in,

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and it showed the process of how
it coalesced into what we would

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
call a tangible result, which
then from the eighth chakra

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
started coalescing
and then dropping down

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
into our conscious
awareness and ability

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
to verbalize, articulate it,
and begin actually creating it

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:90%
in this dimension.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And I found it absolutely
fascinating the step down

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:84%
process from thought through
every single element you

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.480 align:middle line:84%
mentioned to creation itself
in our dimension anyway.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Don't know how it works
in other planets above.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.497 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:31.497 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: Well, I
love that, and I'd

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.049 align:middle line:84%
like to say a few
things regarding that.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:84%
This is very connected to a
lot of the research I've done

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and things that I've seen
in classical traditions,

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.090 align:middle line:84%
particularly what you find
in the Himalayan tradition

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.652 align:middle line:84%
in Nepal, what you see
in their tonka paintings.

00:08:45.652 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
They're very clear about
the importance of the energy

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
centers above the head
and the flow coming down

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:90%
into the central energy system.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And so one part of
that is understanding

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
the energy centers
of the human body

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and the particular flow patterns
of the human energy field.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So I personally feel that
the most important energy

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
access of the whole
human energy field

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
is the vertical axis
coming from above our head,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:84%
from the crown, down the
exact epicenter of the trunk,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.487 align:middle line:84%
down to the perineum, and
then down into the Earth.

00:09:16.487 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'd agree.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: And with
that being the case,

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
there is the ability
to not only develop

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
the chakras and many
chakras inside the body,

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:84%
but as you were saying,
the ones above the head.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And in many of the bodies
of work that I connect to,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
they focus primarily on the
first three above the head

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.040 align:middle line:84%
just like you're
talking about here.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was shown.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: We do that
in prior biogeometry.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the
three above the head

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and how to activate it with
shape, how to activate it

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:90%
with sound, things like this.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
fascinated during research

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:84%
with this back in the 1980s with
this whole question about how

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
do we deal with these energy
centers above the head

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and picking up
higher information--

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: --that gets
transmitted not one

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
word after another, but in
a type of Eureka moment,

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.310 align:middle line:84%
a type of instantaneous
transmission

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
of a tremendous amount
of content in a tightly

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
packed format that when I
trained at the Clear Vision

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
School of Australia with Dr.
Samuel Sagan many years ago,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
he referred to these as
packed thought forms.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what it looks like.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.293 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: And above
the head is where

00:10:22.293 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
we can receive or transmit these
pack lot forms, which is again

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
an instantaneous transmission
of densely packed information

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:90%
that you get in a second.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And the centers
above the head are

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.250 align:middle line:84%
specialized to be able
to connect to these

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and receive them, and then
we have to transmit them

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:90%
down the vertical column.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes down
to the crown center

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:90%
and unpacks the thoughts.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: It's very interesting
that a Nobel Prize was awarded

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
a number of decades
ago to a man named

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Eccles whose work was based on
finding the origin of thoughts

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:90%
in the human mind.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said at the
end of it he found

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
that there was no one
part of the brain that

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:84%
was responsible for starting
the process of having

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:90%
a thought in the human mind.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Instead what happened
is that a type of higher

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.070 align:middle line:84%
dimensional field,
he said, interacts

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:84%
with a human head
at the location

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:90%
of the supplementary motor area.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, the supplementary
motor area,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%
if you look on an
anatomy diagram,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:84%
is exactly where
the crown center is.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chakras.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Exactly.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we take it in
from these higher points

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
as a packed thought
form and then

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:84%
we unpack it through the
firing of the neurons

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:90%
into thoughts in the brain.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: And so this is
actually a key, I think,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
to really advanced forms
of spiritual initiation.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.338 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think it is too.

00:11:40.338 --> 00:11:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
because I don't even

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.505 align:middle line:84%
know what I was
meditating about.

00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I was poking around
asking questions.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when I do that every
now and then, that happens.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll be downloaded
something and be shown

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:90%
the mechanics of something.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is I was simply
looking at the mechanics of how

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:90%
it works.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
make me a master

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:84%
of knowing how to utilize
the upper three chakras.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And so that, as you
say, this is where

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.290 align:middle line:84%
some higher spiritual
initiation can take place.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I would have
to guess that that's

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:84%
because that's interfacing
with, in hermetic parlance,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:84%
the higher mind or the higher
self or the soul spirit

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.570 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And so is this a different kind
then of a different quality

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.420 align:middle line:84%
than of manifestation,
because this complex here

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
would be listening to something
of a more refined nature,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.810 align:middle line:84%
i.e, the higher mind
higher self cell complex

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and that what it may
want to be manifesting.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.395 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: It does.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rather than
a common thought like I

00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:90%
want to manifest a blue dress.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
go through all that.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So the process-- the practical
function and use of these upper

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:84%
chakras for higher manifestation
that would be the question.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.208 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: So one of
the ways to understand

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.330 align:middle line:84%
how to work with it is always
based on sacred geometry,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:84%
because everything has
a pattern, including

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:84%
how to activate the energy
centers of the human body.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.060 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple
patterns involved here.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But the most
fundamental one is what

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
you see in all the classical
traditions as a point

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:90%
in the center of a circle.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that point in the
center of the circle,

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.170 align:middle line:84%
the point is zero dimensional,
and in biogeometry it's

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:27.970 align:middle line:84%
referred to as a transcendental
gateway beyond space and time,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and that's meant
quite literally.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.828 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like a portal.

00:13:30.828 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: Exactly,
in biogeometry.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the circle
around it is the movement

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:84%
from that center
expanding outward

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.220 align:middle line:84%
like the singularity in physics
moving outward to become

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:84%
manifest creation creating
space and time with it to create

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.380 align:middle line:84%
the perfect form
sacred geometry, which

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.710 align:middle line:84%
is the sphere,
because every point

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.980 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the sphere
is equidistant from the center.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
But the center is
always the key.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
The center is how we
connect to dimensions

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.035 align:middle line:90%
of the highest possible level.

00:14:02.035 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, except
for the Earth, of course.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:03.990 align:middle line:90%
It's flat.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest argument for
the fact that the Earth is not

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:84%
flat, because everything
operates in a spheroid

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.345 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: And that's
because if you're

00:14:15.345 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:84%
going to go from
zero dimensionality

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:84%
to create a container
for physical creation

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:84%
to be able to manifest
in, the perfect container

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:90%
is that of this sphere.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Always.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: And so if we
become aware of any energy

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:84%
center in the human
body, so for example,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.110 align:middle line:84%
if a person viewing
our interview here

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.600 align:middle line:84%
was to put their attention
on one of the easiest energy

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
centers to feel, which is
the one between the eyebrows

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
slightly inside the head, the
Ajna center of the Himalayan

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
initiation, if you put your
attention in that, just close

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
the eyes and you put your
attention at that point, then

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:84%
one of the processes from
the Himalayan tradition

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.790 align:middle line:84%
that I learned with Dr.
Sugandha Johar's Vision

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:90%
School a number of years ago,

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is that of move all of
your energy and attention

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:84%
into the center of the center
of the center of the center

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
of that point that you feel
that energetic vibration

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:84%
of that energy center in the
body or even outside the body.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
movement inwards.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And as you go inward, you start
to connect to the actual core

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:90%
power of that energy center.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point of
moving into the absolute center,

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
not only will it activate
the energy center,

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:84%
it has a kind of effect of
flicking an energetic switch

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:84%
in the body of energy where the
energy then begins to move back

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:90%
out in a counter-movement.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you'll feel
a movement of light and energy

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.780 align:middle line:84%
out from the energetic center
forming a sphere around it

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.840 align:middle line:84%
or potentially even like a
sun radiating light and energy

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
in all directions around
that energy center.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
most primal movement,

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
the one into the energy
center and then allowing

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:90%
that to expand back out.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, when it expands
back out, does it bring with it

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
new understanding,
feeling, knowledge?

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: It can.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
movement back out

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:84%
doesn't even have to take
place to access the knowledge.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
You can access the knowledge
with the movement inward.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But that movement
outward is then

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:84%
taking that vibrational
quality, that essence

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that you touched moving
inward and allowing

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:90%
it to expand back out.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about this that
people need to understand

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:84%
is that as the ancient
mysteries went into decline

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and we came into modern
materialistic times, what

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:84%
we got transmitted in
metaphysics tended to be

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle line:90%
fragments of complete systems.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what you'll
tend to find is

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.450 align:middle line:84%
that in one system
versus another,

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:84%
they will teach only one
part of the movement.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So I studied with many different
traditions that only teach

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:90%
the movement into the center.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:84%
You go into the center and
you stay in the center.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Then there were
others that started

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:84%
with putting the attention
on the energy center

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and immediately expanding it out
to be a ball of light or a sun.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But it really only works
to its full capacity

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:90%
if both stages are together.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of
pulsation movement.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And so to move our attention
into the center of the energy

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:90%
center is absolutely vital.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:84%
But then there also has to
be the counter movement back

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:90%
outward.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And in that case,
the consciousness

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that we access by moving
into the center moves

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.450 align:middle line:84%
back outward in
the form of light.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when you
begin to activate the light

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
around the energy centers,
around the body forming

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:84%
the halo, all these
types of things.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And it then leads to the
fundamental understanding

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:84%
that then becomes
experiential for a person

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness and light
are the exact same thing.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:84%
When you experience it
in the inward journey,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.900 align:middle line:90%
its consciousness.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.260 align:middle line:84%
When it comes back out in
manifestation, its light.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And so always, the light
auras around masters

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
that you see in
spiritual depictions

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.570 align:middle line:84%
are representation of the
level of consciousness

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.600 align:middle line:84%
that they achieved because
it comes back outward

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
in its external
expression as light.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fascinating
and helpful and useful.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:84%
We won't go into those upper
chakras, other upper chakras

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:84%
at this time, because
that's more highly esoteric,

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and we actually have on
the ground information

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.720 align:middle line:84%
to use during pattern
recognition in our lives,

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:90%
in our relationships.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.482 align:middle line:90%
So this is a question I have.

00:18:16.482 --> 00:18:18.190 align:middle line:84%
You already talked
about the relationship

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:84%
between biogeometry and
pattern recognition.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Everything has patterns to it.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It all has its own
geometry to it.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things you
say is that pattern recognition

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:84%
allows us to move out
of patterns of suffering

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.902 align:middle line:90%
into fully conscious choices.

00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Please explain that, and then
I have a couple of followups.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: OK.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So in my addressing
this, it's going

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to be more based along the
lines of the sacred geometry

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.610 align:middle line:84%
show we'll be doing at Gaia
more so than the biogeometry

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:90%
from Dr. Karim.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:84%
The biogeometry from
Dr. Karim does touch

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:84%
on some of these
things, but it's really

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
an energetic science,
nature's design language.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So from the sacred
geometry perspective,

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.730 align:middle line:90%
everything is a pattern.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we can see
it as a pattern,

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:84%
one of the places that it has
the strongest initial impact

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:84%
in a person's day to day life
for whether our lives are

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.860 align:middle line:84%
a misery or whether
they are joyful

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and whether our lives we
consider it to be a success

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
or to be a failure is all based
on understanding the patterns

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:90%
behind things.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have fragmentary
understandings

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:84%
of these patterns when we use
modern terms like life hacking.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do a life hack.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:84%
But those life hacks
are almost always

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
based on applying
a specific pattern

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
or seeing what a pattern is
and applying a part of it.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Also when we hear about we need
to have mentors and the mentor

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.398 align:middle line:84%
is going to teach
us certain things.

00:19:41.398 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, the mentor is
going to teach us

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
the pattern that they've learned
that when you do this pattern

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:90%
this particular result happens.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And so particularly
when it comes to things

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.458 align:middle line:84%
that people find really go
the deepest into their heart,

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:54.250 align:middle line:84%
their deepest into
their experience, things

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:84%
having to do with love and
relationships and support,

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
are based on patterns.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
patterns that we'll see

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:84%
is that every person is born
with deep subconscious drives

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:90%
in particular directions.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.347 align:middle line:84%
And this is all based
on preserving life.

00:20:12.347 --> 00:20:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
the area I was going

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:90%
to get into next with you.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:90%
So let's just dive in.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: OK.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So we have these very
deep subconscious drives

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with fight or
flight and survival mechanisms

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and then also with reproduction
and sex and all of these things

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:84%
that people find very visceral
and very exciting to deal with.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But our actual
motivations with them

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.780 align:middle line:84%
often are very deep
in the subconscious,

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and we're not really
clear what's there.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
We know we're attracted to this
person, but not that person.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But if we go more
deeply into it,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
we then begin to find that all
of these subconscious polls

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.200 align:middle line:84%
or drives that we have in
certain directions in our life

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
can be modified
through the application

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:90%
of our clear consciousness.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And so what you'll find is
that spiritual traditions

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:84%
all over the world
understood that one

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:84%
of the first steps of
real spiritual initiation

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:90%
is simply to know thyself.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is what in
the Buddhist tradition

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
would be considered to
be mindfulness practices.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be aware that
a major part of mindfulness

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.377 align:middle line:84%
practices where you're
observing yourself,

00:21:17.377 --> 00:21:18.960 align:middle line:84%
you're observing
your own mind, you're

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:84%
observing your own
motivations, these are really

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.353 align:middle line:90%
based on pattern recognition.

00:21:24.353 --> 00:21:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
how it came into

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:90%
modern Western metaphysics.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Today, if you enter into
Western metaphysics,

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.150 align:middle line:84%
it's often based
on various types

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:84%
of self-help methodologies
and self-help books.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:84%
People start reading them,
these kinds of things.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And you just start
examining your life

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what patterns we've
created that are dysfunctional

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and which patterns we have
that are actually leading us

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:90%
into something better.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And so people will
often begin to recognize

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
the different levels of
subconscious motivation

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:84%
that is constantly handicapping
their relationships

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
or condemning them to repeat the
same problems in relationship

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.240 align:middle line:90%
after relationship.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
of these, but one

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
of the most primal
and most publicized

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:84%
is at the beginnings of
psychology were based on

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:90%
with Sigmund Freud.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Before we might refer it to
as bad mommy and bad daddy,

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and we're in a
relationship with someone

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to cast people in
our own personal psychodrama.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever
unresolved issues

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
we have with our mother,
unresolved issues

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.830 align:middle line:84%
with our father, we then
want to act them out

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:90%
with the external partner.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And it often starts with
the childhood traumas,

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
but we're acting out
with the partner.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But then it can
then begin to lead

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
into issues of maturity
or lack of maturity

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.840 align:middle line:84%
as we begin to discover
by observing patterns

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that the things that I
want in the relationship

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:84%
are completely different
for this other person wants

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:90%
in their relationship.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:84%
They have a pattern
in their mind

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.170 align:middle line:84%
of what they want the
relationship to become

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
that's completely different
perhaps than the pattern

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:90%
that I have in mind.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to casting
people in our psychodrama,

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:84%
the bad mommy, bad daddy
level, you also then

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:84%
have the whole issue
as you get more deeply

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.250 align:middle line:84%
into these
relationship conflicts

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
that one person has the idea
that the relationship is

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:90%
going to be completely static.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you've
ever said or represented

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:84%
will always be true,
will always be present,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's always based
on never changing.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:84%
The other person
believes the relationship

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
is to support both people
in an evolutionary process,

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.210 align:middle line:84%
that there is no constant, but
change and we are constantly

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:90%
evolving and moving forward.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Those two things we begin to
see those patterns don't match.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And what we so often
have is a blaming

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:84%
of one person or
another relationship

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.510 align:middle line:84%
like you did the wrong
thing, I did the right thing,

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:46.937 align:middle line:84%
but for me, I've
tried to get out

00:23:46.937 --> 00:23:49.020 align:middle line:84%
of that as I've learned
through the school of hard

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.900 align:middle line:84%
knocks how this works, and
I've tried to make it simply

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:84%
a matter of either it's a
match on particular levels

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:90%
or it's not a match.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.890 align:middle line:84%
It may be a match physically,
it may be a match sexually,

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.680 align:middle line:84%
may be a match emotionally,
may be a match mentally

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.820 align:middle line:90%
or spiritually.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
common that it will

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:84%
match on certain
levels and not others.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But to be able to observe
patterns and relationships

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and to get our
emotional needs met

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.290 align:middle line:84%
can help us avoid a tremendous
amount of unnecessary pain

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.140 align:middle line:90%
and suffering.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.057 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I couldn't
agree more with that.

00:24:19.057 --> 00:24:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody
listening to this

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.360 align:middle line:84%
knows the empirical
truth of that.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And it does become
complex when you're

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.280 align:middle line:84%
looking at certain areas
matching and others not

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and feeling threatened
at the core,

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:84%
your survival feels
threatened on some level.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So then that's not wanting
to acknowledge the areas that

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:90%
don't match, for example.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:40.200 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things you
mentioned before is a challenge

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.490 align:middle line:90%
is the word subconscious.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So many of the patterns that
you're trying to recognize

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:84%
are below conscious
understanding and recognition.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.130 align:middle line:90%
They are subconscious.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, one way is to look
at your reactions to life

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and start seeing a pattern
in your own reactions

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and then back engineering
what that may be,

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
but maybe you have a better
idea than just back engineering

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.340 align:middle line:90%
observation and reaction.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:84%
How else do we actually gain
truthful information, truthful

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.753 align:middle line:84%
interaction with our
subconscious mind?

00:25:13.753 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: Well,
if we look at how

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.300 align:middle line:84%
the classical traditions
did it, and again, I

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:84%
think Buddhism is a great
illustration of this

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
because mindfulness is so
fundamental to their system.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.600 align:middle line:84%
It simply becomes
a thing to reach

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.680 align:middle line:84%
the same level of neutrality
that we have in our dealing

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.595 align:middle line:84%
with other people into
observing our own inner life.

00:25:34.595 --> 00:25:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very true.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: It tends to be that
we will justify anything that

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.250 align:middle line:84%
we want or we feel or
our reactions like--

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Supports our desire.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Exactly.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:84%
It's justified because of
this, that, or the other thing.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But if there was somebody else,
then we'd be critical of it.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
step is always to get

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:90%
into a type of neutral state.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And really, as you said,
reactivity is the core of it.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
As long as we're
in reactivity, it's

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.660 align:middle line:90%
almost a thing of two stages.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.770 align:middle line:84%
We start out in reactivity, then
we become mindful and observe

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
the reactivity, and through a
completely neutral observation,

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and at first don't even
try to change the pattern.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just recognize it.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Just recognize it.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that the Buddhists
observed that was so powerful

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is that if you have an addictive
process to a particular thing,

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:84%
then just observe what
you're thinking and feeling

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.870 align:middle line:84%
when you are additively
reaching out for that thing

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and really feel
what that is fully.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And that in and of
itself starts to work

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:84%
toward breaking the addiction,
because it really can only

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:84%
work fully if it's reactive, if
it's something that is coming

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:84%
out of the subconscious,
not observed,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and then becomes a
deeply set mechanism.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So this means that when
we observe patterns,

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:84%
we can observe patterns that
have become habits that we

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:90%
didn't even know we had.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
it goes so deep.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And then if you want to take
it as far as continued life

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:84%
cycles and reincarnation, we
have stuff that's in there.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:09.140 align:middle line:84%
We have all of these pixels
all loaded in that subconscious

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was
addicted to mochas.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't drink coffee or
tea until I was over 40,

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:90%
and then I was introduced.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:90%
I went down the hole.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to
mochas, which what kid

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.680 align:middle line:84%
doesn't like hot
chocolate, right?

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.390 align:middle line:84%
An excuse to drink
hot chocolate.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So I became addicted
and I thought, OK, I

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:90%
need to break the addiction.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing this every day.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.760 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not good for me.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't feeling that great.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So I know I had to
work with the mind

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'd had a
hypnotherapy clinic,

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and I thought,
OK, just show me--

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.840 align:middle line:84%
let me see where
this is coming from.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And boom, I ended up in the
most unexpected place lifetimes

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.620 align:middle line:84%
ago in a pattern of
abuse that was happening.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And what was available
to me in that lifetime

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.780 align:middle line:84%
it was in a culture that
chocolate and coffee,

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I could combine at that
time, were available to me

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:90%
in that culture.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I use
to boost serotonin

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.350 align:middle line:84%
to handle the
abusive experiences.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And so interestingly,
at that time

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I was in a situation kind
of like that, not as bad.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And so an interesting
I developed the desire

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
for the cure when
the situation arose.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was tied into a time
near a few hundred years ago.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Just tossing it out there.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Yeah.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The cure, the
problem rose together.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.580 align:middle line:90%
in a far distant time.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: There's a
fascinating type of exercise

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.990 align:middle line:84%
that's done in the European
Rosicrucian tradition that's

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:40.820 align:middle line:90%
called the dissolving practice.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And the dissolving
practice is something

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:47.060 align:middle line:84%
where you could dissolve
virtually anything in your mind

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.635 align:middle line:84%
to reveal the energy
pattern behind it--

00:28:49.635 --> 00:28:50.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's useful.

00:28:50.885 --> 00:28:52.843 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: --or the
spiritual essence behind it

00:28:52.843 --> 00:28:55.340 align:middle line:84%
so you could
dissolve that quartz

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:84%
crystal into an
energetic pattern

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that it crystallized
around to give it the form

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.800 align:middle line:90%
and pattern that it has.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.320 align:middle line:84%
You can do the same
thing to a human being.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
Rosicrucian practice,

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
you would dissolve away
the image of the person

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and then see the energetic
pattern behind them,

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.870 align:middle line:84%
which includes aspects
of their consciousness

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.650 align:middle line:90%
and their mind, et cetera.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:17.970 align:middle line:90%
And so one of the thing--

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You do this
through your desire or you

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.720 align:middle line:84%
will to do so or is there a
specific protocol or practice

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.362 align:middle line:90%
or pattern used to do that?

00:29:25.362 --> 00:29:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: There's a
particular longer exercise

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.390 align:middle line:90%
that I teach in some classes.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.080 align:middle line:90%
I go step by step through it.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But the basic concept is
simply as a internal action

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.295 align:middle line:84%
you are wiping away the
person's physical appearance,

00:29:39.295 --> 00:29:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and instead what
you're left with

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:41.990 align:middle line:84%
is the vibration
of their voltage.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, energy imprint.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.783 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: And the way
they hold their body,

00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:46.880 align:middle line:90%
the way they move their hands.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:84%
As you go more deeply
into it, you then

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.650 align:middle line:84%
see that certain energy
centers are highly activated,

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.930 align:middle line:84%
others are not as
activated, certain lines

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.310 align:middle line:84%
of energetic
connection are present,

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that they are particular
geometric forms

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:84%
in the connections between the
energy centers and acupuncture

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.290 align:middle line:84%
points, et cetera that form
more complex geometries,

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and that is actually
the one thing

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.863 align:middle line:84%
we take with us through
the gate of death.

00:30:10.863 --> 00:30:12.530 align:middle line:84%
We don't take anything
physical with us.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:84%
What we take through is the
structure of the subtle bodies.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
really affected me

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I think at the most core
level as I was studying

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:84%
all these traditions
was really to understand

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:84%
that it's the structure of the
subtle bodies that determines

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.170 align:middle line:84%
happiness or misery in
life that determines

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.450 align:middle line:84%
our positive spiritual
development are

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:36.020 align:middle line:84%
going into some terrible rabbit
hole that is destructive.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.200 align:middle line:84%
It's all what structures are
we creating in the subtle body.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And so this has many
different aspects to it.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But I would just simplify
it for a general audience

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:84%
by saying every thought
that we ever have,

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:51.080 align:middle line:84%
every emotion we ever generate
creates an energetic movement,

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and that begins to
activate or to impair

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.420 align:middle line:84%
the action of particular
energy centers in the body.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It begins to move energy into
greater geometric patterns.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And so some very advanced
spiritual masters

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.145 align:middle line:84%
in some traditions
like the Himalayas, one

00:31:06.145 --> 00:31:08.270 align:middle line:84%
of the first things they'll
do when they're sitting

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.388 align:middle line:84%
with a new disciple is
that they'll look at them

00:31:10.388 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and they'll see what's the
structure of the subtle body

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.615 align:middle line:84%
and to what degree is that
central axis fully developed.

00:31:16.615 --> 00:31:17.990 align:middle line:84%
If it's not fully
developed, they

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.360 align:middle line:84%
know they haven't done
a lot of work before.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But if that central axis
is highly developed, then

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.842 align:middle line:84%
in a short period of time
they can activate the centers

00:31:24.842 --> 00:31:27.350 align:middle line:84%
above the head, achieve
the pack thought forms,

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and be able to be fully
conscious and realms

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.800 align:middle line:90%
beyond the physical.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that structuring
of the subtle body

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I think is so
important and it links

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:84%
to the type of karmic things
like you're talking about

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that those things
created a structure

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.100 align:middle line:84%
in the subtle bodies that
need to be illuminated

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and transformed.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.067 align:middle line:84%
And the way to transform
it is through light.

00:31:47.067 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And light comes from
the consciousness

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:90%
that we place on it.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I found the
discovery very useful

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.770 align:middle line:90%
and I stopped drinking mochas.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:56.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I thought--

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:56.441 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: There you go
with practical results.

00:31:56.441 --> 00:31:58.149 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought
that's not necessary.

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that was very,
very practical.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So I don't need to be
doing that anymore.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Exactly.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I just found
again the patterns are

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:07.670 align:middle line:84%
what's interesting,
those track patterns

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:08.810 align:middle line:90%
are what's interesting.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And there were patterns
on two sides here,

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:84%
on problem and solution,
both had become patterns.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And so again often people
hear sacred geometry.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It's very common in
metaphysics today.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.310 align:middle line:84%
You see the word sacred
geometry and then

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:25.130 align:middle line:84%
you see things like
shapes of platonic solids.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:26.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.080 align:middle line:84%
That's a major part
of sacred geometry.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.797 align:middle line:84%
But I think sometimes
because the way

00:32:30.797 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:84%
it's presented, people
don't understand what

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:84%
sacred geometry is is as
a modern term for what

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.550 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times would
have been understanding

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:84%
the key to everything, because
once you know the pattern, that

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:90%
gives you power over the thing.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Without knowing the
pattern, you can't

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.600 align:middle line:84%
begin to change it in
any constructive way.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So things that are absolutely
fundamental to our lives,

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.660 align:middle line:84%
whether it's diet, exercise,
the rhythm of waking and sleep

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.970 align:middle line:84%
or again what people
find penetrates

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:02.210 align:middle line:84%
deepest to their heart with
emotional relationships,

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:84%
these things are all
based on patterns.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it just becomes a
question for a person, what

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.240 align:middle line:90%
do you want to explore?

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.940 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to move
ahead in your life right now?

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But by becoming
conscious of the pattern

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and first just observing
it, don't try to change it.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And then in observing
it, it'll begin

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:22.388 align:middle line:84%
to become clear what parts of
it you're not resonant with.

00:33:22.388 --> 00:33:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
you can then begin

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.500 align:middle line:84%
to make a new choice for
what's the new pattern I

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:90%
want to put into place.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And that new
understanding of pattern

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.580 align:middle line:84%
will then get ingrained
till it becomes a habit.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Best taken as
you say in baby steps.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise everyone
wants to go all in,

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.560 align:middle line:84%
you want to fix everything
at once, you get discouraged,

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:90%
and you go away.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.510 align:middle line:84%
You're more overwhelmed
than anything else.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So I like the way you describe
it or you explained it

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.190 align:middle line:84%
in terms of taking one thing
at a time examining it fully,

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:55.740 align:middle line:84%
that one thing first until
you can begin seeing patterns

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:56.540 align:middle line:90%
emerge.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking
at trying to create

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:01.040 align:middle line:84%
a different kind of
relationship by recognition

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.600 align:middle line:84%
of these patterns,
how would that

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.030 align:middle line:90%
look in super practical terms?

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go back to
your example before.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:08.840 align:middle line:84%
You have this, this,
and this in common.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.110 align:middle line:84%
You do not have this in
common, and perhaps that thing

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.770 align:middle line:90%
is important to both of you.

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:15.955 align:middle line:90%
How do you work with that?

00:34:15.955 --> 00:34:17.889 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: One of the things
that if we're talking about

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:18.909 align:middle line:90%
brass tacks here--

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.076 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, brass tacks.

00:34:20.076 --> 00:34:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: --you'll
find that very commonly

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.960 align:middle line:84%
if you have two people getting
together in a relationship

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and they both are liking
the way it's going so far,

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.780 align:middle line:84%
you have to be very careful that
one person says to the other,

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to be upfront with
you and I'm looking for this.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.520 align:middle line:84%
The other person may
not be looking for that.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.400 align:middle line:90%
But because they don't want to--

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Disturb the boat.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: They don't
want to rock the boat.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:44.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to torpedo
the boat at the beginning

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.210 align:middle line:84%
before anything happens,
they say, "Oh yeah, sure.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:47.199 align:middle line:90%
I'm into that.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:48.139 align:middle line:90%
That's great."

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that we
have to develop sensitivity to

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:52.989 align:middle line:84%
is the energetics
of the other person.

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:55.239 align:middle line:84%
And there's all these kind
of different ways to do it.

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:57.910 align:middle line:84%
We can do it through body
language and observing that.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a type of
energetic sensitivity people

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.930 align:middle line:84%
who are naturally empaths, they
already automatically do it.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But for people who aren't
gifted as empaths to begin with,

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.400 align:middle line:84%
it's always a question of
how quiet we get inside.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great things
of any relationship that

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.620 align:middle line:84%
indicates it going
off track is when

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.230 align:middle line:84%
grasping comes in, the way the
Tibetans talk about grasping.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.105 align:middle line:84%
You want to grasp it,
you want to possess it,

00:35:25.105 --> 00:35:26.800 align:middle line:90%
you want to control it.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And so at those times, you
have to train yourself to do

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.350 align:middle line:90%
something completely opposite.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be
fully conscious,

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.492 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise it'll just
become a reactive pattern

00:35:36.492 --> 00:35:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and you won't even
know what's happening.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But you have to do a pattern
interrupt like that saying

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.720 align:middle line:84%
neurolinguistic programming,
do a pattern interrupt,

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and then get a break where you
can go into complete silence

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and stillness and
be fully conscious.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Because becoming aware of
other people's thoughts,

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:84%
feelings, et cetera in the
healthiest possible way

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.250 align:middle line:84%
isn't a matter of invasively
going into their field

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and grabbing things.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of becoming
so quiet inwardly yourself

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:08.170 align:middle line:84%
that it becomes evident
what's in the energy field.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:11.480 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be super quiet
inside to be able to hear it.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I think you hit
the nail on the head

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.850 align:middle line:84%
when you talked about
before about reactivity.

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Getting out of the reactive
mind is the difference

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.310 align:middle line:84%
between a person who
is on a path downward

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and a person who's
on a path upward.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
that's totally true.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:84%
However, the reactivity
itself is giving you

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:90%
hidden information.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So how do we use
the information,

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.135 align:middle line:90%
yet break the pattern?

00:36:33.135 --> 00:36:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: Well, one of
the parts of the reactivity

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.740 align:middle line:84%
is that it's often connected
to the subconscious drives,

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.800 align:middle line:84%
subconscious needs for
trying to get a need met.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to get
clear in ourselves,

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:47.290 align:middle line:84%
why do I keep having
problems in relationships

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.480 align:middle line:90%
based on this particular issue?

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Because often once
the person is not

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:84%
giving us what we're
wanting, then it's

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.620 align:middle line:90%
a matter of blaming them.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: Again, often this can
come from bad mommy, bad daddy,

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.420 align:middle line:84%
or other types of
things that we want

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:90%
that they're not giving us.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But it really comes
down to, are we

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:10.300 align:middle line:84%
focused on a relationship
that is supporting

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.750 align:middle line:84%
the other person's freedom or
are we basing the relationship

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.900 align:middle line:84%
on, "I want you to be
the person I'm casting

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.000 align:middle line:90%
in this role in my psychodrama.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.662 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed
to look like this.

00:37:20.662 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you what to wear.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.630 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed
to talk like this.

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
criticize your speech

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and tell you exactly the words
you need to say otherwise.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.190 align:middle line:84%
You need to do this, that,
and the other thing,"

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes more
and more dominating.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Getting that moment where
we can go into the quiet,

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:38.260 align:middle line:84%
the silence, break
the reactive pattern,

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.260 align:middle line:84%
see what that is,
but also to go back

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:46.060 align:middle line:84%
into the heart and the silence
to restore an appreciation

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.770 align:middle line:84%
for the freedom of
the other person,

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.740 align:middle line:84%
because we have
our needs, but it's

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.390 align:middle line:84%
really easy through
the reactive mind

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.580 align:middle line:84%
to start wanting to
manipulate other people.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you see this
all day long every day

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:56.935 align:middle line:90%
in most relationships.

00:37:56.935 --> 00:37:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
matter of degree.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:37:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very seldom do you
see someone that is truly

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.790 align:middle line:84%
holds that enlightened
place of genuine belief

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and thought that it
is my joy to support

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:14.543 align:middle line:84%
your freedom above my
desires in the moment even.

00:38:14.543 --> 00:38:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a big one.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:20.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the Holy
Grail of being human

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:21.820 align:middle line:90%
and in human relationship.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: Yes there's a concept
in the Rosicrucian tradition

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.270 align:middle line:84%
particularly the work
of Rudolf Steiner where

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.870 align:middle line:84%
he talks about all the
higher spiritual hierarchies

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.390 align:middle line:84%
above the human being
the angelic ranks

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and they all have
these esoteric names

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.860 align:middle line:84%
but the esoteric name
of the human race

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.870 align:middle line:84%
in this form of Rosicrucianism
is spirits of love and freedom.

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And a whole choice
on the physical plane

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:51.160 align:middle line:84%
is how are we going to balance
love and freedom, because love

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:56.680 align:middle line:84%
is unity and freedom is
separation and free choice.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And to have these work
in a harmonious way

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.343 align:middle line:84%
is very difficult
to achieve, but it's

00:39:02.343 --> 00:39:03.510 align:middle line:90%
what we're all striving for.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With human
emotions involved,

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.203 align:middle line:84%
distorted from whatever is
in that subconscious of ours.

00:39:09.203 --> 00:39:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Absolutely.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And until we're fully
conscious of that,

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.470 align:middle line:84%
what will tend to
happen is will simply we

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:84%
have a type of knee jerk
mechanism where we're alone,

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.030 align:middle line:90%
now I'm lonely.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.230 align:middle line:90%
I want a relationship.

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.188 align:middle line:90%
I'm with somebody else.

00:39:21.188 --> 00:39:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Now I've bonded with somebody
else in the relationship,

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.280 align:middle line:90%
and good God, I'm--

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.488 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm not letting go.

00:39:25.488 --> 00:39:26.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: Or it can be
that then it gets too tight.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And like I have the love, but
I no longer have the freedom,

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:90%
and now I want my freedom back.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.137 align:middle line:84%
And then you become
lonely again,

00:39:35.137 --> 00:39:36.470 align:middle line:90%
and then you want to bond again.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:37.928 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:39:37.928 --> 00:39:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
place in between there

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.520 align:middle line:84%
where you have now come
to recognize consciously

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that someone is
just listen to you.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.490 align:middle line:90%
So geez, I tend to do that.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I do tend to get
a little needy, I

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.590 align:middle line:84%
do tend to be a little
controlling, whatever

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.610 align:middle line:90%
the flavor is.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Now you recognize that and
you don't really desire that.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.280 align:middle line:90%
You do want to live into this.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But what is the antidote
inside oneself then

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that is going through
that kind of suffering

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:84%
to release so that you can
truly take joy in someone else's

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:84%
freedom even to the extent
that freedom could take them

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.327 align:middle line:90%
away from you one day?

00:40:15.327 --> 00:40:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: So there's
one aspect of it

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.220 align:middle line:84%
that I think you're
pointing toward in,

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.370 align:middle line:84%
what types of burdens
do we carry internally

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:25.860 align:middle line:84%
that have to be let go so
that we can be in that space?

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: And what works
along with that is then

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.090 align:middle line:84%
having an understanding of the
pattern involved that we have

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:84%
both the need for
love and connection

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and the need for freedom
at the same time.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And that means that rather than
going into a pendulum swing,

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and you see this all the
time, people get deeply

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.770 align:middle line:84%
into relationship, then they
don't have enough freedom,

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.870 align:middle line:84%
so they make it blow
up, and they'll blow up

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.190 align:middle line:90%
one relationship after another.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Then they get their freedom
back and say, "oh, thank God.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm out of that
claustrophobic relationship."

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For a year or two
and then they're lonely.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:55.535 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: Just
like I'm so lonely.

00:40:55.535 --> 00:40:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Now I got to get back into it.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So rather than doing
the pendulum swing,

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.750 align:middle line:90%
it's a matter of rhythm.

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this is another
part of pattern.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.460 align:middle line:84%
It's another part
of sacred geometry

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.800 align:middle line:84%
is having a correct
rhythm with it.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And people have
different structures

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:11.780 align:middle line:84%
internally for like
how much of my day

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.240 align:middle line:84%
do I want to spend with the
partner and how much of my day

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.130 align:middle line:84%
do I want to have
free that I can

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:18.080 align:middle line:90%
choose to do what I want to do.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And again it's a matter of
conversing with the partner

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:23.453 align:middle line:84%
to be clear about
being on the same page.

00:41:23.453 --> 00:41:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think everybody
needs to be really clear

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.995 align:middle line:84%
that in the beginning
of relationships,

00:41:26.995 --> 00:41:29.585 align:middle line:84%
it's very common that one person
will try to please the other

00:41:29.585 --> 00:41:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and say, "oh yeah, I'm
totally into that too.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm all about."

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or God forbid,
both of you were doing it.

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So you have no
baseline at all here.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: Until
finally it blows up.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And it will blow up.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot of this has
to do with toxic mythology,

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that we carry so much toxic
mythology about relationships.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to cast in
our psychodrama in the role

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.670 align:middle line:90%
of our perfect partner.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we start to
get upset with them

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:84%
at a very reactive
subconscious level,

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.020 align:middle line:84%
because, "you're not acting
like my perfect partner.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't look the
way they should look.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to go
change your appearance

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.820 align:middle line:84%
to look like the
person I'm looking for,

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.330 align:middle line:84%
change your clothes, change how
you speak, change your work,

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.340 align:middle line:84%
change who you spend time
with," and it becomes

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.080 align:middle line:90%
more and more controlling.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And so to get out of
the toxic mythology

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that this one person
is going to be the one

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:21.560 align:middle line:84%
perfect match for you and find
how to go into that quiet space

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:25.770 align:middle line:84%
to be able to perceive who they
are as a unique spiritual being

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and to give them the freedom
to do what they need to do.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Because it's been my
experience that when

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.650 align:middle line:84%
you are in a relationship
and both people

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:37.220 align:middle line:84%
feel completely free and they're
both choosing to be together

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.980 align:middle line:84%
at that time, but they also feel
completely free to express when

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.930 align:middle line:84%
they want to have
alone time, this

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:90%
is not a very simple level.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.130 align:middle line:84%
That's when things tend
to work out the best.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you've got a
situation that's untenable.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So it always comes down
to me of not blaming

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.800 align:middle line:84%
one person or another, but
is simply is it a match,

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and then to always
realize it's not simply

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.530 align:middle line:84%
that the other person is
not doing what I want,

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:04.670 align:middle line:84%
but what toxic mythologies am I
bringing into the relationship,

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:08.480 align:middle line:84%
what burdens am I carrying in
my own soul for my own suffering

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.660 align:middle line:84%
that I'm wanting the other
person to heal inside of me

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.413 align:middle line:90%
rather than my letting it go.

00:43:13.413 --> 00:43:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Because this is another
very common one.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.663 align:middle line:84%
You have two people
in a relationship.

00:43:16.663 --> 00:43:19.130 align:middle line:84%
One of them subconsciously
wants the relationship

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:22.760 align:middle line:84%
to heal all their old
wounds, so what Caroline Myss

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.380 align:middle line:90%
would talk about woundology.

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.175 align:middle line:84%
And so they want the
relationship to be, "oh, I'm

00:43:27.175 --> 00:43:28.550 align:middle line:84%
going to heal your
wounds, you're

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:29.823 align:middle line:90%
going to heal my wounds."

00:43:29.823 --> 00:43:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And the other person may be
OK with that for a little bit.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, let's deal with
that and then it'll be done.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.110 align:middle line:84%
The other person is like,
well, no that's the pattern.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:37.520 align:middle line:90%
We do this for years.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.990 align:middle line:90%
We keep working on those wounds.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:41.390 align:middle line:84%
But the other person's
real motivation

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:43.310 align:middle line:84%
is not anything having
to do with healing

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.270 align:middle line:90%
each other's wounds.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:48.350 align:middle line:84%
It's about having a partner
for all kinds of exploration.

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And those are completely
different motivations.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Completely.

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.162 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: And so,
of course, even

00:43:53.162 --> 00:43:54.620 align:middle line:84%
if they care about
each other, it's

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.470 align:middle line:84%
going to blow up in the end
with a lot of recriminations

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.940 align:middle line:84%
of why did you do this
to me type of thing.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to be aware for
bringing into the relationship

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.960 align:middle line:84%
these internal burdens,
these internal wounds that's

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.940 align:middle line:84%
making the pattern
of our subtle bodies

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and our consciousness that
are going to keep blowing up

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:12.080 align:middle line:90%
all of our relationships.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end
the other person

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:16.790 align:middle line:84%
is going to lose interest
in having to constantly

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:21.170 align:middle line:84%
be our counselor, be our
healer, and play whatever role

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.850 align:middle line:90%
we're assigning to them.

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.890 align:middle line:84%
They're going to want to
be free at some point.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.500 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.760 align:middle line:90%
We're about out of time.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And look, we didn't get to
some of these other topics

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.720 align:middle line:90%
about sacred geometry.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.065 align:middle line:84%
But as you're saying, it's
all geometry, it's all dense,

00:44:35.065 --> 00:44:36.440 align:middle line:84%
it's all in the
patterns, and you

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.720 align:middle line:84%
have another show that
will delve much more

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:84%
deeply into the hidden energy
of the geometry behind all

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.790 align:middle line:90%
of these dynamics.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:44.735 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair to say?

00:44:44.735 --> 00:44:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Yes, absolutely.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And our sacred geometry
series is coming up.

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.935 align:middle line:84%
We're going to deal with
everything from the energy

00:44:49.935 --> 00:44:53.030 align:middle line:84%
science to the relationships to
the vibrational patterns that

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:55.170 align:middle line:84%
stand behind everything
in manifestation.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for
bringing such clear

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and articulate information,
but also relationship advice.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.940 align:middle line:84%
What an unexpected treat for
everybody, because right now

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:09.650 align:middle line:84%
apparently, after a period
of being cooped up together

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.930 align:middle line:84%
for a long time and
not a lot going on,

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.850 align:middle line:84%
relationships have been
struggling greatly.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:17.533 align:middle line:84%
Domestic abuse around
the world is up.

00:45:17.533 --> 00:45:19.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to wait in
line to get a ticket

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.292 align:middle line:84%
to get a divorce in
the divorce court.

00:45:21.292 --> 00:45:23.250 align:middle line:84%
There are no counselors
to see, because they're

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:24.690 align:middle line:90%
tired and overbooked.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the things that
you've said I think

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.730 align:middle line:84%
are really important
if someone wants

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:32.670 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention and
pick it up on a position

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:34.050 align:middle line:90%
of self-responsibility.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I think what you
said was beautiful.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Oh, thank you.

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And just has a very
quick comment to that,

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I do think we're at an absolute
crisis point in the world

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:42.765 align:middle line:84%
now because we've never
had a global lockdown.

00:45:42.765 --> 00:45:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, we are.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GILBERT: This never
happened before until now.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:46.950 align:middle line:10%
Everybody who is
in a relationship

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.860 align:middle line:10%
is dealing with the thing
about "yes, I had the love,

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.300 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't have any freedom.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I got locked in
with this person."

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're desperate
for freedom.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.790 align:middle line:84%
People who were
alone and sequestered

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.490 align:middle line:84%
for this whole thing have
their own mental challenges

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and emotional challenges
they felt completely isolated

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:05.730 align:middle line:90%
and abandoned for a year.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that understanding

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.990 align:middle line:84%
these relationship
dynamics as people

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:14.700 align:middle line:84%
try to get whole and healed
from this emotional damage,

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.090 align:middle line:84%
they need to be clear about
this love and freedom dynamic.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
you're absolutely right.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.235 align:middle line:84%
And then you throw
the powder keg

00:46:21.235 --> 00:46:24.990 align:middle line:84%
of politics on top of
it, of disease and fear

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:28.230 align:middle line:84%
of illness and
death on top of it.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:29.430 align:middle line:90%
We're at a crisis point.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think your
thinking is very clear.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:32.680 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So I look forward to
seeing your pieces.

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GILBERT: Wonderful.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.020 align:middle line:90%
