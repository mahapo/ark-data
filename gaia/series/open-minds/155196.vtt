[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many of you
have been on a healing journey

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:90%
and continue to be.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:10%
The holy grail is to find
the source of the discomfort

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:10%
or illness.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:84%
According to Dr.
Bradley Nelson, you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
can find it trapped in
your body in the form

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:90%
of unresolved emotions.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
His book, "The Emotion
Code", explains

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
how this phenomena
works, and you explain

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:90%
how you bust it as well.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:84%
First of all, people say
it can't be that easy.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.675 align:middle line:90%
And you say, yes it can.

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Absolutely.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then we
start our conversation.

00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Healing
doesn't have to be hard.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:90%
Healing is easy.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why is
because the emotional baggage

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:10%
that we have is the most
common underlying cause

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.320 align:middle line:10%
of all of our problems.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:10%
And now we have a way to
find that emotional baggage

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:10%
and get rid of it.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.027 align:middle line:84%
And it's so easy
that kids can do it.

00:01:14.027 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:90%
So doesn't have to be difficult.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.276 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.412 align:middle line:90%
Kids, OK.

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get into kids.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
surrogates for kids

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of things.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.577 align:middle line:84%
I over-prepared for
this, so we're just

00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
going to have to do
a shotgun approach

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:90%
and get as much as we can in.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, how
did you find your way

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
to this discovery
of the emotion code

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.962 align:middle line:84%
and how to use it
the proper way?

00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, I spent 17
years as a holistic chiropractic

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:90%
physician.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the habit of trying
to tune in with the higher

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
power: God, source energy,
whatever you want to call it,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
before I would work
on each person.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was a totally private,
totally personal thing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:84%
But as I was doing
that, I was gradually

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
led to more and
more understanding.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.652 align:middle line:84%
And what I came to learn
is that all of my patients,

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:84%
no matter what they
were suffering from--

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:84%
whether it was depression or
anxiety or phobias or panic

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:84%
attacks or PTSD or eating
disorders or infertility

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
or asthma or digestive
disorders or cancer,

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:84%
or whatever kind of physical
pain they might have--

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.600 align:middle line:84%
they all had something in
common, and that was they

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:84%
all had what we often refer
to as emotional baggage.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And what became clear to me
was that our emotional baggage

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:90%
is actually a real thing.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Emotional baggage, we
often use that phrase,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.756 align:middle line:84%
usually in referring
to somebody else.

00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that so-and-so,
that person's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.421 align:middle line:90%
got a lot of emotional baggage.

00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reality is we
all have emotional baggage.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And our emotional
baggage consists

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:90%
of trapped emotional energies.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
You see, the body
is an energy field.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you're feeling an
intense emotion of anger

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
or resentment or
whatever it might be,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:84%
on a quantum level,
what's happening

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:84%
is your body is feeling a
certain frequency of energy,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:90%
a certain vibration.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And if that emotion
is so powerful,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.060 align:middle line:84%
if it's too powerful, then
sometimes, when that event is

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:84%
over, when the bully moves
away or the divorce is over

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
or whatever happens, some
of that emotional energy

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
is still with you in the
form of this little ball

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.235 align:middle line:90%
of emotional energy.

00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a long
time to figure this out

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:90%
because these are invisible.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:90%
You can't see them.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.217 align:middle line:90%
But they're there.

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And we all have emotional
baggage like this,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's affecting all of us.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And it is the single biggest
underlying common denominator

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
for all these problems
that I mentioned.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Chronic illness,
chronic pain, all of it.

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Absolutely.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were able
to essentially simplify it

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.370 align:middle line:84%
into a protocol that
virtually anybody can follow.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.846 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Pretty much.

00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much anybody.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very simple.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.402 align:middle line:84%
In fact, let me
tell you a story.

00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I was talking with
a woman recently

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.372 align:middle line:84%
who told me about her son and
the experience that she had.

00:03:48.372 --> 00:03:50.580 align:middle line:84%
She got "The Emotion Code"
book and the book on audio

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and started reading
and listening to it.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And her son started reading
it and listening to it,

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and he started practicing
with his friends.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't pay
much attention.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But a couple of weeks
later, the phone rang,

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and the woman on the other
end of the phone line

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.001 align:middle line:84%
identified herself as the mother
of one of her son's friends.

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said, listen,
she said, your son's

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:90%
been doing this emotion thing.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what he's doing.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.414 align:middle line:84%
But she said, my son has
had a severe phobia of water

00:04:10.414 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
all of his life, and
it's been very disruptive

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
for his life and our
life as a family.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And we've taken him to
everybody and tried everything,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.666 align:middle line:90%
and nothing has ever worked.

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
She said, right now I'm
at the community pool.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:84%
My son is in the pool playing
in the water with the other boys

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:90%
for the first time in his life.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.646 align:middle line:84%
She said, your son
did this to him.

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I can't wrap my
mind around this.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.950 align:middle line:90%
How is this even possible?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:90%
What's he doing?

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Those two boys are only 11,
so that's how easy this is.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.919 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now that's wonderful.

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And toward the end
of the talk, we're

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:84%
going to get into the phenomena,
some amazing anecdotes.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And then toward the
end of the talk,

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:84%
we'll get into
functionally how it works.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
thing is one thing

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
you said in the book
popped out right away,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.687 align:middle line:84%
which was that no, time
does not heal all wounds.

00:04:54.687 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
it, because that's

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
a perception of a lot of
people is, I'll tough it out,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.670 align:middle line:84%
it'll dissipate over
time, it'll heal itself.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well,
oftentimes, when we

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
go through these difficult
emotional events,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.720 align:middle line:84%
we have emotional
baggage, we have

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:84%
these trapped emotions that
are now inhabiting our bodies.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
is we consciously

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:84%
do not know that we
have these energies.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:90%
But they affect us.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:84%
They deflect our path so that
we're not taking the best

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.896 align:middle line:90%
path for our lives, often.

00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:25.770 align:middle line:84%
We're taking other paths
that we'd rather not

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.510 align:middle line:84%
take that cause us to
re-experience the emotions we'd

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.200 align:middle line:90%
rather not experience.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
So to give you an idea--

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.199 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why is the whole
total being mechanism

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:90%
trying to re-experience them?

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, those
emotional energies

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
were never really processed
completely in the first place.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And so those energies
stay in the body,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and they really have
two effects on us.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:84%
They have a physical effect
because if you can remember

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
that the body is an energy
field, when you have a trapped

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:90%
emotion, it's a ball of energy.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And what it's doing is it's
distorting that normal energy

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
field of the body 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So all the chemical
reactions taking place

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
within that area
of tissue, they're

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:90%
being affected to some degree.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
The flow of chi energy, the flow
of blood, the flow of lymph,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and so on, it's all affected
to one degree or another.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's why 90% of all the
physical pain that people have

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
is actually caused
or contributed to

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.690 align:middle line:84%
by emotional baggage,
by trapped emotions.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
this other effect,

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and the other effect
is that if you

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
have a trapped emotion,
for example, of anger,

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
those tissues that are
within that sphere of energy

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:84%
where that thing's
lodged in the body,

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
those tissues are literally
feeling that emotion 24

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:90%
hours a day, seven days a week.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So if a situation
arises in your life

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:84%
where you might tend
to feel that emotion,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:84%
you will slide right into
that emotional resonance

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:84%
much more readily, much more
easily than you otherwise

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
would have because
literally part of your body

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
is already feeling that
emotion of anger or depression

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.611 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's just slipping
into resonance, really.

00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Exactly right.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking about
the fact that each emotion

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that we carry, whether
it's a trauma or chronic

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.700 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it
is, is correlating

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
to a particular
organ in the body yet

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily
stay confined

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:90%
to that place in its effect.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Right.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.678 align:middle line:84%
What we believe is what
they believed anciently

00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient Chinese medicine.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the
organs in the body

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and the glands in the body
are the frequency generators.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
They generate these
frequencies that we

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.780 align:middle line:90%
interpret as the emotions.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the lungs,
one of the prime emotions

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.032 align:middle line:84%
there that they
produce is grief.

00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about one
of the stories in the book

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
is Dana Reeve, Christopher
Reeve's wife, who

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.512 align:middle line:90%
died of cancer, lung cancer.

00:07:49.512 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And everybody said well,
she must have been a smoker.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
It must have been
secondhand smoke.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
It was because of what her
husband had been through.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he had
passed on by then.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Exactly.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It was about a year after
he passed on, I think,

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.749 align:middle line:90%
that she was diagnosed.

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
Debbie and her broken heart.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: OK.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:84%
A patient came into
me once who thought

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:90%
she was having a heart attack.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:84%
She had crushing chest
pain, difficulty breathing.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:84%
The left side of her
face was completely numb.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.104 align:middle line:84%
Her left arm was
completely numb.

00:08:16.104 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And I told my staff, this
looks like a heart attack.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.310 align:middle line:84%
We might need an
ambulance, so stand by.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And I took her into a room
and I did some testing

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:90%
on her using the emotion code.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was she had
a trapped emotion of grief.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And we were able
to trace this back,

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and it had occurred
three years before.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I figured that
out, all of a sudden she

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:84%
burst into tears and
she said, I can't

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:90%
believe that is affecting me.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.621 align:middle line:90%
I thought I dealt with all that.

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:44.070 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, what happened?

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
She said three years before,
her husband had an affair.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.020 align:middle line:84%
She found out about it,
confronted him about it,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.412 align:middle line:90%
and the whole marriage blew up.

00:08:50.412 --> 00:08:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And she thought she was going
to be married to him forever.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:90%
She cried buckets of tears.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:90%
They got a divorce.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:84%
She spent a year in therapy
dealing with it mentally,

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.550 align:middle line:90%
and had even gotten remarried.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
As far as she was
concerned, that ex-husband

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:90%
was ancient history.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Done and dusted.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.979 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Right, exactly.

00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:84%
But as far as her
body was concerned,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.320 align:middle line:84%
that emotional energy of
grief was still right there.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I released that
emotion from her body

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.090 align:middle line:84%
that was trapped using
this simple process.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And within about three
seconds, the feeling

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:84%
came back into her
arm and into her face,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.114 align:middle line:84%
and the chest pain was gone, the
difficulty breathing was gone.

00:09:24.114 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is one
of the first cases

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:31.354 align:middle line:84%
that I saw where the
effect was so pronounced.

00:09:31.354 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And after she left the
office 10 minutes later

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.640 align:middle line:84%
feeling totally fine,
I sat down at my desk,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.691 align:middle line:84%
and I remember my mind
was just reeling thinking,

00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:38.565 align:middle line:90%
how is that possible?

00:09:38.565 --> 00:09:40.100 align:middle line:90%
What did I just see?

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But now we know, you see, that
people die from a broken heart

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Why a spouse leaves so
quickly after another.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yep.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.744 align:middle line:84%
And she would have
been, I think,

00:09:49.744 --> 00:09:51.156 align:middle line:84%
one of those people
that probably

00:09:51.156 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:84%
would have died
of a broken heart

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.069 align:middle line:84%
and nobody ever
would have known.

00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:55.860 align:middle line:84%
She's still alive, by
the way, doing great,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.440 align:middle line:90%
has a horse farm in Oregon.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably
26, 27 years ago.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:84%
There was another
one I wrote down here

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.800 align:middle line:90%
that I thought was interesting.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.859 align:middle line:90%
This was about Jessica.

00:10:06.859 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:84%
We'll do a couple of
anecdotes and then go along.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But Jessica being
pinned to the past.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Oh, yes.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
fascinating, too.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, this
illustrates a great point, too.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.011 align:middle line:84%
I was at a workshop once,
and I had a young woman

00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that volunteered to come up
out of the audience to see

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:90%
if she had a trapped emotion.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I tested her and I found
she had a trapped emotion.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
The emotion was
forlorn, which is

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
feeling all alone and desolate
and hopeless and lonely

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And I traced it back
using the emotion code

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and found that this had occurred
in the first year of her life.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
she's not going

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.886 align:middle line:90%
to know anything about this.

00:10:39.886 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her if she did.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter whether
a person remembers anything

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:90%
consciously.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.760 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind remembers
very little anyway.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:90%
She had no idea.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of this
event, though, I had met her,

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.220 align:middle line:90%
and she came with her mother.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to look
out at the audience

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and her mother is
as white as a sheet,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.679 align:middle line:84%
and she's got her
hands like this.

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, do you
know anything about this?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.178 align:middle line:84%
And she was so
embarrassed, but she

00:11:02.178 --> 00:11:04.814 align:middle line:84%
said that when she
was a young mother

00:11:04.814 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and her daughter was in
that first year of her life,

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:90%
she used to use cloth diapers.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And one day she accidentally
pinned her daughter

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:90%
to her diaper.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And gives you an idea how she
must have been so overwhelmed.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And this poor baby
crying for help.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And her mom didn't know it until
she changed her the next time.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I know.

00:11:24.425 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Can you imagine?

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:84%
She just felt so
horrible about it.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, that emotion of forlorn,
that feeling of no one's

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:84%
helping me, I'm
in all this pain.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
That emotion that
stuck in her body.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So I released it from her, and
she went back and sat down.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of forgot about it.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And 10 days later, her mother
sent me an email and she said,

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
my daughter has had this
problem since about age eight,

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:84%
where she's had difficulty with
her gait and the way she walks.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.332 align:middle line:84%
And she's had pain in
her hip and in her knee.

00:11:54.332 --> 00:11:56.290 align:middle line:84%
We've tried everything,
taken her to everybody.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.289 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's ever fixed it.

00:11:57.289 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But she said, from
the moment you

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:02.054 align:middle line:84%
released that emotion
of forlorn from her,

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:84%
she's walking completely
normally for the first time

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.650 align:middle line:84%
in her life and
she's got no pain,

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.509 align:middle line:84%
plus she feels this
new lightness of being

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:09.800 align:middle line:90%
that she has never felt before.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.200 align:middle line:84%
She's telling
everybody about this.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And you see this illustrates
a really important aspect

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:90%
of the emotion code.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is that with
the emotion code,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
we tap into the
subconscious mind

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
where all the answers are
about what's wrong with us.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
See, she had no
conscious idea that--

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was the pain that
was released on the same side

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:90%
of the body that was pinned?

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, it was a
trapped emotion of forlorn.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:90%
I just released the emotion.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: But she
said she'd had pain--

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Probably.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just wondering
if that had even come up.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: That's a
really good question.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no
one brought it up.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.848 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Probably was.

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But still,
yeah, it makes sense.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a good time to
go to the deeper discussion

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.960 align:middle line:84%
of the subconscious because
it is not at all understood,

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:90%
even to this, day by science.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: No.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:56.530 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
it, the subconscious mind

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.902 align:middle line:90%
is so powerful.

00:13:00.902 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It remembers everything
you've ever done,

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I believe, everything
you've ever

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:84%
seen in a crowd, everything
you've ever eaten or tasted

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:06.816 align:middle line:90%
or touched or smelled.

00:13:06.816 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
It's so powerful that it
can take the lunch you had

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and it could convert
that into new blood

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:84%
cells, new cardiac muscle
tissue, new nerve cells.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it,
there's 137 trillion cells,

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:90%
they say, in the body.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And every single one of those
is equivalent in complexity

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
to a fully loaded
aircraft carrier,

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.620 align:middle line:84%
10,000 people working on board
at their individual jobs,

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.044 align:middle line:84%
jets with their
engines spooled up

00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:84%
on the ramp ready to take off,
electronic countermeasures,

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:90%
radar, everything.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.050 align:middle line:84%
A single cell, and there's
137 trillion of those.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So the subconscious
mind, I believe,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:84%
is aware of every
cell, and not only down

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
to the cellular level,
but beyond, down

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.794 align:middle line:90%
to the quantum level.

00:13:43.794 --> 00:13:46.460 align:middle line:84%
We really have not even begun to
scratch the surface about this,

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe is that
when we come into this world,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:84%
our ability to access
all of that intelligence

00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:00.350 align:middle line:84%
is dialed way, way, way
back so that we have access

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:84%
to a very, very limited
amount of our intelligence

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:90%
here consciously.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, the subconscious
mind is still there,

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and all that intelligence
is accessible.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, we can ask
questions of the body,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:90%
and we can get answers.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my whole
career has been based on

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:84%
for the last 28 years is
opening the subconscious mind

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
like a book, asking
questions, finding out

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:90%
why people are having symptoms.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious
mind knows all of it.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:90%
It knows.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.440 align:middle line:84%
If you're diagnosed with
cancer, for example,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.554 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea
consciously why.

00:14:32.554 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:90%
You go to the doctors.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:90%
They don't know why.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.600 align:middle line:84%
They give you
medication and so on,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%
and chemotherapy and radiation.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
subconscious knows why.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.833 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Your
subconscious mind knows

00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:42.980 align:middle line:90%
with a perfect understanding.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's all we do is ask it.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the emotion code,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:84%
that's really where it came
from, because I was asking.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:54.977 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I found that so
much of what is wrong with us,

00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:56.810 align:middle line:84%
so many of our symptoms,
are actually caused

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:90%
by our emotional baggage.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to find
and get rid of it.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.510 align:middle line:90%
And anybody can do it.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beautiful
thing about this.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.385 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go and
pay money to see somebody.

00:15:06.385 --> 00:15:07.407 align:middle line:90%
You can do it yourself.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:84%
We have practitioners that we've
certified all over the world.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.040 align:middle line:84%
We've got about 3,600 certified
emotion code practitioners now

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.014 align:middle line:84%
in 64 countries, and
they work with people

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:17.430 align:middle line:84%
all over the world because
this can be done at a distance,

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:90%
as well as live and in person.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But you can do it yourself
also, just like the boy that

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:90%
was 11 that fixed his friend.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.776 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're speaking
of the subconscious, not

00:15:27.776 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:90%
only can it discern--

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.620 align:middle line:84%
because it knows all these
mechanisms in action--

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
discern the path
forward, it also

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:84%
recognizes the trauma of
the past or deep past, even.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes, it remembers.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.511 align:middle line:84%
It remembers with a
perfect understanding.

00:15:42.511 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of
the fascinating things

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:84%
about this that we've
found is that we often

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
inherit emotional
energy at conception

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:84%
that is passed to
us from our parents,

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:84%
from one parent or the
other, or maybe both.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes those
inherited emotions--

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:90%
it's the same thing.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a trapped emotion,
a ball of energy,

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.454 align:middle line:90%
but it's shared with mom or dad.

00:16:04.454 --> 00:16:05.620 align:middle line:90%
And they may have shared it.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.820 align:middle line:84%
They might have gotten
it at conception

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.736 align:middle line:90%
from their mom or dad.

00:16:07.736 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these will go
back tens of generations.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the most
powerful aspects of this work,

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:84%
that when we release that
emotional baggage from a living

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.010 align:middle line:84%
person, our testing
shows that it also

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:84%
releases from those that
have passed on, no matter

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.887 align:middle line:84%
how many generations
back they may be.

00:16:27.887 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now, that
gets into some esoteric stuff,

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.790 align:middle line:84%
It gets into different
notions of time and space

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and what healing really is.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.900 align:middle line:84%
It also-- certainly
with this audience,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:84%
you have to, then, kind of look
at the notion of if we have

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:84%
been here before, and we
have cycles of reincarnation,

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:84%
what might we be
inheriting from ourselves

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
from other times past of trauma,
as well as through our genetics

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:90%
and family?

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Is that something?

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, it's all
a very interesting topic.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:90%
And the fact that--

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
the bottom line, really,
if you think about it--

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it
almost doesn't matter.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're getting
this from the past,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.810 align:middle line:84%
do we even need to know whether
it's from us in the past

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.722 align:middle line:84%
or from our family in the past
if it's showing up in the past?

00:17:14.722 --> 00:17:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, we don't
really know all the answers.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a very, very deep well.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things that we find

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
is that when we release that
emotional baggage that we

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:84%
inherited, oftentimes it can
have very powerful effects

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
upon us because if
you think about it,

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.155 align:middle line:84%
you might not only have
your grandfather's ears,

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:39.700 align:middle line:84%
but you might also have
his rage or his tendencies

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:84%
for depression because of the
emotional baggage that he had

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:90%
and where he got it.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:84%
He might have gotten it
from somebody earlier.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line, wherever
these emotions come from,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:84%
is that we are living diminished
lives until we get rid

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:90%
of that baggage--

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.602 align:middle line:84%
whether we got it
from an ancestor,

00:17:58.602 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:84%
or we picked it up
ourselves in the womb,

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:84%
or before we were
conceived or whatever--

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that emotional baggage
that we're carrying

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.640 align:middle line:84%
is making us into
people that we really

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.651 align:middle line:90%
are not quite supposed to be.

00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Because when you release
enough of that baggage,

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like stepping
out of your old skin

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.570 align:middle line:84%
into this new state
of beingness that

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
is much closer to what
the universe really

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.960 align:middle line:90%
intended for you to be.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes easier
for you to feel love

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and easier for you to feel
connected to God, the universe,

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.490 align:middle line:90%
and so on, and other people.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't know
what that embodies yet.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Science has no idea yet
what all of that embodies

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and the complexity of
that, that it's permeating

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.462 align:middle line:90%
our subconscious mind.

00:18:44.462 --> 00:18:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is permeates
the subconscious mind.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Absolutely.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful thing
is you can ask the body,

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.377 align:middle line:84%
you can ask the
subconscious, and it

00:18:50.377 --> 00:18:51.460 align:middle line:90%
will give you the answers.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:90%
It knows.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk-- well, I
shared a little anecdote

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:84%
before we got rolling here
on camera about years ago.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of my
audience knows I used

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.220 align:middle line:84%
to have a little hypnotherapy
clinic 20 years ago.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.744 align:middle line:84%
And I really liked dealing
just with emotions.

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really like
all the pattern stuff

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:84%
like no smoking and
drinking and all that.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I started
playing around with

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.050 align:middle line:90%
was silent hypnotherapy.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And I bring this up
because you were saying,

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and your book says, that
energy wants to speak to us.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:90%
It has to find a language.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.387 align:middle line:84%
And you're using
many different--

00:19:25.387 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
there are many different
divination devices.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
talk about those.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And one I used was kind of
classic, ideomotor response,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:84%
just going mind to
mind with the person.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And I found it
absolutely fascinating

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that the less their
conscious mind knew,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:84%
the much more powerfully
their subconscious

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:90%
could release things.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.215 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
what you're doing.

00:19:45.215 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Well, sure.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.087 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind
knows very little.

00:19:48.087 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you remember
what you had for breakfast

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.110 align:middle line:90%
three days ago?

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:90%
We remember very little.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.656 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unless
you're really habitual.

00:19:54.656 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Have the same thing
every day at 8:23.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not one of those.

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: It's kind of sad.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I think when we come
into this world,

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.359 align:middle line:84%
our access to that
intelligence--

00:20:02.359 --> 00:20:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and there are reasons
for this, I believe--

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
but our access is
dialed way, way back.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:84%
But when people die, and
they go to the other side

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.589 align:middle line:90%
and they happen to come back--

00:20:13.589 --> 00:20:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and of course, they're the
only ones that we hear from.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:90%
The rest are gone.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But those people that
come back say things

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:84%
like, when I went
to the other side,

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:84%
it was like I had access
to all this intelligence.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:84%
I could ask 1,000 questions
at a time or more,

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and all the answers
would flow in instantly

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:90%
and be understood perfectly.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Imagine having a mind like that.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.631 align:middle line:84%
I believe that is
really who we are.

00:20:35.631 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I believe that, too.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:84%
We're bathed in a sea
of that constantly.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just having the
processing unit tuned

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.415 align:middle line:90%
to where we can perceive it.

00:20:45.415 --> 00:20:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So my own
belief is that we're here

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:90%
for certain reasons.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.366 align:middle line:84%
We're here-- it's a
testing ground for us.

00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, we get to make
choices between right and wrong,

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.406 align:middle line:84%
and what are we going to choose,
and who are we going to become?

00:20:56.406 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And are we going to choose
to serve and love or do

00:20:59.150 --> 00:20:59.950 align:middle line:90%
other things?

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But the beautiful
thing about getting rid

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:84%
of your emotional
baggage is that it

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
helps you to actually
rise and ascend

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
in that vibrational
scale, right?

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.690 align:middle line:84%
You get finer and finer the
more the dense negative emotions

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.540 align:middle line:90%
are released.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:84%
You can't help but become
more refined in your field.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes, exactly right.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we all have
this emotional baggage.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's easy to get rid of.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.270 align:middle line:90%
It's just a simple process.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And getting rid of it
is such a blessing.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it can
really be life-changing.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Just to release
emotions can be--

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.836 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
a few more of those.

00:21:46.836 --> 00:21:49.700 align:middle line:84%
But first let's talk about
the heart wall conceptually,

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and then a couple anecdotes
would be really good.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, what happened
was, in a nutshell, my wife

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:84%
had a dream a
number of years ago.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
As I was trying to help
her interpret her dream,

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly had what
I can only describe

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:84%
as a waking vision, where I saw
this beautiful hardwood floor.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.049 align:middle line:84%
And this lasted for
several minutes.

00:22:10.049 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm seeing this floor,
I have this understanding

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
in my mind that my wife's
heart is underneath this floor.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:90%
This was bizarre.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.320 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what it meant.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:90%
I asked her if she knew.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.791 align:middle line:90%
She had no idea.

00:22:19.791 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:84%
We prayed, asked God to help
us, started doing some testing.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
was she was born

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.180 align:middle line:90%
into a very volatile family.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.937 align:middle line:90%
Her father was a rage-aholic.

00:22:27.937 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And at about age two,
she started putting up

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.470 align:middle line:84%
a wall around her heart to
protect her heart from being

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:90%
totally broken.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And that all, we found, was
made from these energies,

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.800 align:middle line:84%
from these trapped emotional
energies, literally

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:90%
from her emotional baggage.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A fortress.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Exactly right.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:42.820 align:middle line:90%
So she put up a wall.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes people say that.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I had to put up a wall.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, the problem that
she had, or the results

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.041 align:middle line:84%
of this in her life, one
thing was that she never

00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:84%
felt like she belonged in
any group she was ever with,

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.831 align:middle line:84%
even people she'd
known all her life.

00:22:57.831 --> 00:23:00.242 align:middle line:84%
She always felt like she was
on the outside looking in,

00:23:00.242 --> 00:23:01.450 align:middle line:90%
never felt like she belonged.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Another thing was that
it was hard for her

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:84%
to feel positive emotions,
easy to feel negative ones.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.810 align:middle line:84%
She struggled with
depression and anxiety.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And when we started
releasing those emotions

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and taking down that
wall, all of a sudden,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.077 align:middle line:84%
when the last one
was gone, there

00:23:17.077 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:90%
was a huge change for her.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, dramatic.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:90%
And that changed her life.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.446 align:middle line:84%
Well, initially I thought
maybe she's the only person

00:23:24.446 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:90%
in the world that has this.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:84%
93% of people have this
phenomenon going on,

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.390 align:middle line:84%
because we've lived
enough life that we

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.880 align:middle line:84%
felt like our heart's going
to break at some point.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Now ancient societies
believed that the heart

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:84%
is the seat of the soul, the
source of love and romance

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and creativity, and
the core of our being.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.047 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the west, we've never
believed any of that, see.

00:23:45.047 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:84%
But now we have
instrumentation that's

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.409 align:middle line:84%
starting to show us that the
ancient peoples were right.

00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:84%
We're finding that
the heart puts out

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.650 align:middle line:84%
an energy field that's 12 feet
in diameter around the body.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:84%
When you're feeling love or
affection for another person,

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:84%
your heartbeat shows up
in their brain waves.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Your heart rates
synchronize and so on.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And what we believe is
that the heart really truly

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:84%
is a second brain, and
that it's sending messages

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
to all the body, and that
the brain in your head

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:84%
is obeying the messages
sent by your heart.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens is, when you
feel like your heart's going

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:84%
to break, the
subconscious mind will

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:84%
put a wall up around
that heart made

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
from your trapped emotions,
from your emotional baggage.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:90%
It's invisible.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.229 align:middle line:90%
But it can be so powerful.

00:24:30.229 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Can I share a story about this?

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Not long after we
discovered this on my wife,

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
there was a woman who
came in to see me.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:90%
She was 38 years old.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:90%
She came in to me for neck pain.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And she'd seen a
couple of other doctors

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.186 align:middle line:84%
that hadn't been
able to help her.

00:24:43.186 --> 00:24:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So she was talking with
me, and she told me

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.270 align:middle line:90%
that she was single.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.750 align:middle line:90%
She hadn't dated in eight years.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:84%
She was never going
to date again.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:90%
She was going to die single.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:90%
She was celibate, basically.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:90%
And she was dead serious.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
She was never going to
be married or even have

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:90%
a relationship.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:90%
And she was an attractive woman.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:90%
She was a nurse.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.650 align:middle line:90%
She was only 38.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, why
do you feel this way?

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said that eight years
before she was really in love

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:84%
with this guy who dumped
her and broke her heart.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.775 align:middle line:84%
So I tested her and found she
had this phenomenon, this heart

00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:90%
wall phenomenon.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.284 align:middle line:84%
There were three emotions,
three layers of this wall.

00:25:14.284 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And all three of those emotions
became trapped in her body

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
when she went
through the breakup.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:90%
So I released the emotions.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Probably took me 10 minutes.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, when
we got to the last emotion

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and released it, suddenly
the neck pain was gone.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what she had come in for.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And so that was it.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have to
adjust her neck or anything.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.080 align:middle line:90%
She was fine.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And she left the office
and didn't come back.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Three months later,
she walks back in.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.140 align:middle line:90%
And I'll always remember this.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:37.940 align:middle line:90%
She looked great.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.780 align:middle line:90%
And I said, hey, you look great.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.500 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen you for a while.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
She said, you know, my neck's
been fine since I was here.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But, she said, you cleared
that heart wall for me.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:90%
And she said that really works.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:84%
She said, two weeks
after I was here,

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I found out my
childhood sweetheart

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:84%
has been living right
around the corner from me

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.872 align:middle line:90%
for almost eight months.

00:25:54.872 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're dating
and we're in love.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's going
to ask me to marry him.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind
of thing that happens

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:90%
when this wall is taken down.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:84%
People fall in love who never,
ever thought they would.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.981 align:middle line:84%
People attract their soulmate
suddenly into their life.

00:26:07.981 --> 00:26:09.980 align:middle line:84%
People fall in love
at advanced ages.

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:84%
People start to
manifest abundance.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:12.920 align:middle line:90%
It starts to flow to them.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Creative ideas start to
flow because your best

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:84%
stuff is in this brain,
not this brain, see?

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with the world is

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:84%
that most people are living from
this brain and not this one.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I can actually
add a little bit of validation

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:90%
Years ago, I was with--

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't with Howard
Martin, but someone else

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.320 align:middle line:90%
with Heart Math.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And we had their
technology, and then we

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.690 align:middle line:84%
had another technology from Lee
Gerda's brain state technology.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So electrodes were on the heart,
electrodes were on the head.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:90%
And we had a very kind of open--

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.130 align:middle line:84%
who had had trauma in her
past-- but very loving,

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.100 align:middle line:90%
open person to experiment on.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And what we saw was that
in response to the stimuli,

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:03.140 align:middle line:84%
the heart was responding
just a nanosecond prior

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to the brain's response, that
it was the first responder, that

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
first to perceive the
experience that was happening.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was interesting
because we were watching just

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.329 align:middle line:90%
on monitors, you know?

00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, think
about all the stories

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:84%
that have been
collected since the 60s,

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.110 align:middle line:84%
since they started
doing heart transplants.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh, yes.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.533 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: You know,
people who inherit

00:27:23.533 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:84%
the memories, the loves,
the affinities of the donor.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:26.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:26.975 --> 00:27:28.809 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Their handwriting
totally changes.

00:27:28.809 --> 00:27:30.183 align:middle line:84%
They find out, oh
my gosh, that's

00:27:30.183 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:90%
my son's handwriting you have.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their taste
in music and sports

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.060 align:middle line:90%
and food, all that changes.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:84%
There is so much going
on with the heart.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And so this heart
wall is such an important thing.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.149 align:middle line:90%
And it can be so powerful.

00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:84%
A woman brought her
son in to see me.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:47.986 align:middle line:90%
He was nine years old.

00:27:47.986 --> 00:27:49.610 align:middle line:84%
He'd been diagnosed
as being clinically

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:90%
depressed at nine years old.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And it started out that he
wouldn't hand in his homework

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.810 align:middle line:84%
at school, and then he
wouldn't do his homework.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.869 align:middle line:84%
And then one day she paid
a visit to his school,

00:27:58.869 --> 00:28:00.410 align:middle line:84%
only to find his
teacher berating him

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:90%
for how pathetic he was.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.759 align:middle line:84%
And she took him out of
school because she was upset.

00:28:03.759 --> 00:28:05.091 align:middle line:90%
And she tried to do home school.

00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:05.960 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't working.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:84%
She'd come into his room at
night and he'd be on the floor,

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and she'd say, what are
you doing on the floor?

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.585 align:middle line:84%
And he'd say, I don't
deserve to be in a bed.

00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know
what was wrong.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But all of his joy was, gone
and she didn't know what to do.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, she took him to
the medical profession.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.360 align:middle line:84%
They said they couldn't
help him because he wouldn't

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:90%
admit that he was depressed.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So she brought him in to
see me, and what we found

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:90%
was that he had a heart wall.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And we found that the
emotions making up

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
this wall, the
layers of emotions,

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
each layer, each
trapped emotion had

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.280 align:middle line:84%
to do with something
significant that

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.070 align:middle line:84%
had happened in their family,
in their extended family.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.874 align:middle line:84%
So one of the trapped
emotions, one of the layers,

00:28:40.874 --> 00:28:43.040 align:middle line:84%
was the death of a couple
of cousins in a car wreck.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Another layer was the death of
a cousin who died at a hayride.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.280 align:middle line:84%
He fell off the hayride and
was run over by the tractor.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And then another emotion, the
last one, here's what happened.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.154 align:middle line:84%
He and his family were
at a lake in California,

00:28:55.154 --> 00:28:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and they were at
a family reunion.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:57.980 align:middle line:84%
His sister, who
was 12 years old,

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:84%
was the designated
babysitter for him

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and his best friend,
another little boy,

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.800 align:middle line:90%
also five years old.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.992 align:middle line:84%
They were on a dock,
no adult supervision.

00:29:05.992 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:84%
The sister was trying to teach
this little boy how to swim,

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:09.866 align:middle line:84%
and he disappeared
under the dock.

00:29:09.866 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, geez.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.980 align:middle line:84%
That's so much trauma
for a little kid.

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.021 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: So much trauma.

00:29:14.021 --> 00:29:16.864 align:middle line:84%
So an hour later the divers
finally found his body

00:29:16.864 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:84%
under the dock and
pulled him out.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was there, and here is
his best friend, totally blue,

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:90%
gone.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:84%
The overwhelming guilt that
his sister was feeling--

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.970 align:middle line:84%
having that horrific
thing happen

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
on her watch as the babysitter--
that guilt was so intense,

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.640 align:middle line:84%
it was all so
intense, that emotion

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:84%
became trapped in his body
and immediately formed

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:84%
into this wall around his
heart, or his little heart

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:84%
was going to just
absolutely break.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:90%
We cleared that last emotion.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.089 align:middle line:84%
And then all the indications
were that wall was gone.

00:29:49.089 --> 00:29:50.130 align:middle line:90%
So his mom took him home.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And for the next
couple of days he's

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:84%
lying around kind of lethargic,
and she was thinking,

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.770 align:middle line:84%
well, it doesn't look like
that really didn't anything.

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But on the morning
of the third day

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.368 align:middle line:84%
after we released that heart
wall, he got himself up early,

00:29:59.368 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:84%
got himself ready
to go to school.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.586 align:middle line:84%
He comes downstairs and here's
what he says to his mother.

00:30:03.586 --> 00:30:06.580 align:middle line:84%
He says, mom, I can
go back to school now.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy pappy.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.250 align:middle line:90%
Direct quote.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Happy pappy.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.034 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And he did
go back to school.

00:30:12.034 --> 00:30:13.450 align:middle line:90%
And all of his joy was back.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And he went into the
advanced program for kids

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.730 align:middle line:90%
because he was so smart.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And all his learning
disabilities were gone.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And she told me, she
said, if she had not

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.200 align:middle line:84%
been open to trying
something so different,

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.890 align:middle line:84%
she'd still be parenting a very
sad and frustrated little boy.

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was many years ago.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.010 align:middle line:10%
That little boy is 28 years
old now and has two kids

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:10%
and is doing great.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But you know, that took me
a half an hour to do that.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you something.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.900 align:middle line:84%
If I live to be a
million years old,

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I will never regret spending
that half hour to help him.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Because I mean--

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You bought
his life back for him

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and helped him buy
his own life back.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.160 align:middle line:90%
But yes, that's amazing.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about mass trauma.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:84%
You have one example
in there of a woman--

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:58.876 align:middle line:90%
I forgot-- Mary?

00:30:58.876 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I have it in my
notes somewhere--

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Sarah-- and the
JFK assassination.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.060 align:middle line:84%
these big events that
are frozen in our minds,

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.032 align:middle line:90%
like 9/11, JFK, and others.

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes, exactly right.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, this woman was 72
years old, I believe,

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.290 align:middle line:90%
when she came to me.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:16.225 align:middle line:84%
And it was her very first
visit, and I tested her,

00:31:16.225 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and the very first
thing that showed up

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.308 align:middle line:84%
was that she had
a trapped emotion.

00:31:19.308 --> 00:31:21.180 align:middle line:90%
The emotion was sadness.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And so using the
emotion code, I was

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.520 align:middle line:84%
able to trace it back 10
years, 20 years, 30 years.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.074 align:middle line:90%
And it traced back to 1963.

00:31:29.074 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
gee, I wonder if that

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:90%
was about JFK's assassination.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm verbalizing that to
her and testing her to see--

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.422 align:middle line:84%
testing her subconscious
mind at the same time

00:31:39.422 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that I'm getting a very strong
answer from the subconscious

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:84%
that yes, this is
what this was--

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.670 align:middle line:84%
at that same time, she's
breaking down crying.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And she tells me that yes,
that affected her so deeply.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And then when his son, JFK
Jr., died in the plane crash,

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.110 align:middle line:84%
she said it was like it all
came back all over again.

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And all she could
do for days was cry.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:57.960 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't work.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't do anything.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
well, that's what

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.210 align:middle line:90%
these trapped emotions do.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They make us feel
exaggerated emotions

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.610 align:middle line:84%
or feel them in an
exaggerated way.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, OK, I want
to know where has this trapped

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.040 align:middle line:84%
emotion, this ball
of energy, where

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.470 align:middle line:84%
has this been all
these years since JFK,

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:90%
since November 22, 1963?

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Where's it been?

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.453 align:middle line:90%
And you can do this.

00:32:20.453 --> 00:32:22.620 align:middle line:84%
You can test the body,
and it'll tell you.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So I tested her, and this is
just using muscle testing.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.141 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't on the right
side of the body.

00:32:28.141 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:84%
It was on the left
side of the body.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't in the
abdomen or in the leg.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.736 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
in the chest area.

00:32:32.736 --> 00:32:36.030 align:middle line:84%
It was actually in the
area of the left breast.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I discovered
that, all of a sudden

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:84%
she and I looked at each
other like a couple of owls

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:44.250 align:middle line:84%
with these big eyes
because four years before,

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:47.940 align:middle line:84%
she'd had that breast removed
because it was malignant.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And every cancer that we have
seen in almost 30 years now,

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.500 align:middle line:84%
without exception, we have
found emotional baggage,

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
trapped emotions, as
an underlying cause,

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:90%
every single time.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.917 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:33:03.917 --> 00:33:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And cancer, like anything
else, is just a symptom.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.583 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
for me to point out

00:33:07.583 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that we don't
promote the emotion

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:90%
code as a cure for anything.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.450 align:middle line:84%
All we're doing is
finding and removing

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:16.130 align:middle line:84%
the baggage that
underlies our symptoms.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we have to--

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.310 align:middle line:84%
humanity hasn't really come
to grips with the notion

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:90%
that this mass is 99.9% space.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.290 align:middle line:90%
We're just space.

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
persistent illusion

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:90%
because we can feel it.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And our beings, whatever
this species is about,

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:84%
have these five senses
to perceive ourselves.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.650 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, it's all space.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And so thoughts themselves
are electromagnetic, right?

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.540 align:middle line:84%
So to have a thought
or a feeling--

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.520 align:middle line:84%
now put feelings and
emotions into it.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.040 align:middle line:84%
If we have thoughts
and feelings,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.399 align:middle line:90%
are feelings more magnetic?

00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wondering,
because you use--

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.398 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
talk about using

00:33:59.398 --> 00:34:00.960 align:middle line:90%
magnets in clearing feelings.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.010 align:middle line:90%
Why magnets?

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.680 align:middle line:84%
What is the nature of thought
and how it starts programming

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.489 align:middle line:84%
into the nonphysical
tissues that we are?

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:11.489 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well,
the reality of it

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:13.120 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, you're
absolutely right.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:90%
We're beings of energy.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.359 align:middle line:84%
The body is more a force
field than anything else.

00:34:16.359 --> 00:34:17.159 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:18.659 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:20.326 align:middle line:84%
Atomically there's
almost nothing there.

00:34:20.326 --> 00:34:21.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Right.

00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
it, we consist of all

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.090 align:middle line:90%
these subatomic energies.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.980 align:middle line:84%
They're all flying
in close formation,

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.260 align:middle line:84%
keeping us from
flying apart, really.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.889 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing
thing, our existence,

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:31.469 align:middle line:90%
if you stop and think about it.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:35.219 align:middle line:84%
Well, thoughts are energy,
feelings, emotions.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:90%
It's all energy.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And if those emotions-- if we
choose to feel those emotions

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and really allow them to become
really powerful in our lives,

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:84%
because we do make the choice
ourselves to feel those

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.280 align:middle line:90%
emotions--

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.060 align:middle line:84%
if they're too powerful
they get stuck in the body.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Now why we use a magnet
is because first of all,

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.930 align:middle line:84%
magnets are another form of
energy, and they're ubiquitous.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:02.790 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got a magnet
on their fridge, right?

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's simple.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:12.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple tool that we use
to release the trapped emotion.

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Now the way that
we do it is we run

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.130 align:middle line:84%
the magnet-- at a certain
point in the process,

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.290 align:middle line:84%
we just run the
magnet down what's

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.960 align:middle line:84%
called the governing meridian,
which starts at the upper lip,

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.180 align:middle line:84%
goes over the head
down to the tailbone.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.940 align:middle line:84%
If you're working on yourself
and you don't have a magnet,

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.140 align:middle line:90%
you can use your fingertips.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you're working on
yourself-- because they're

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.744 align:middle line:90%
magnetic, of course, right?

00:35:30.744 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what you
do is you can just

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.990 align:middle line:84%
run that meridian
like this a few times

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:90%
to release that emotion.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.530 align:middle line:84%
If it's inherited,
you'll do 10 swipes.

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.374 align:middle line:90%
If it's not, you do three.

00:35:39.374 --> 00:35:41.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're working on someone
else, you can do it this way,

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
or you can go right
down their back,

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.690 align:middle line:90%
the top down to the bottom.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
when you're doing

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that, your intention to
release that emotional energy,

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that is also a
specific frequency.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.642 align:middle line:90%
That's a specific energy.

00:35:56.642 --> 00:35:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you're going
down that governing

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.980 align:middle line:84%
meridian, what you're doing is
you're taking that intention.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.840 align:middle line:84%
The magnet, whether
it's your fingers

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.910 align:middle line:84%
or any other kind of
magnet, we believe

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:09.175 align:middle line:90%
it magnifies your intention.

00:36:09.175 --> 00:36:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And the governing meridian is
a meridian that connects up

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.110 align:middle line:90%
to all the other meridians.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that energy goes
into that meridian.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And the result is that
intention floods the body,

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and it just erases
that trapped emotion,

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.960 align:middle line:84%
kind of like if you take a
credit card out of your wallet

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and you rub a magnet on the
magnetic strip and then you

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:90%
try to go to the mall--

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No info.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: You're in trouble.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.800 align:middle line:84%
What about in the
circumstance where

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.300 align:middle line:84%
a person has what
they believe to be

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.340 align:middle line:90%
benefit from a negative emotion?

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, to be garnering
sympathy by being sick a lot,

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.540 align:middle line:90%
or so forth.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.930 align:middle line:84%
How does this work
with that when they're

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:90%
attached to that emotion?

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: OK.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Let me address this.

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.684 align:middle line:84%
What happens to people
is that they sometimes

00:36:56.684 --> 00:37:00.960 align:middle line:84%
choose, like you're
saying, to stay sick

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.946 align:middle line:84%
because they're getting
benefits from that and so on.

00:37:03.946 --> 00:37:07.200 align:middle line:84%
What I have found with those
people is that if you can bring

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:12.000 align:middle line:84%
them to a greater understanding
of their emotional baggage

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and what it's doing to
them, and how it's really

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.400 align:middle line:84%
short-circuiting what could
be a much better existence--

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.900 align:middle line:84%
if you can bring
them to that point,

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:84%
then they can be
willing to get well.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Part of the unique problem,
though, with people is that--

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and I spent the last 10 years
of my practice working primarily

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.406 align:middle line:84%
with people that have been
told there was no cure for them

00:37:30.406 --> 00:37:32.460 align:middle line:90%
at all in western medicine.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to screen people
because if a patient of mine

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:84%
really truly believed
in their heart of hearts

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that they were never
going to get well,

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.360 align:middle line:90%
there was nothing I could do.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.287 align:middle line:90%
That would have to be.

00:37:45.287 --> 00:37:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: That's just how it is.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's how strong
the intention is, too, though.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: That's right.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:50.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I was going
to ask you this a little bit

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.660 align:middle line:84%
ago when we were
talking about kids,

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.760 align:middle line:84%
your own sons, the experience
with Rhett and Drew.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a
little bit about when

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.870 align:middle line:84%
they were little what happened,
because you are very frustrated

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:04.450 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have twin boys
that are now 28 years old.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
three-ish, just turning four,

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Drew, we thought, first of
all had a hearing problem

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.860 align:middle line:84%
because he wouldn't
speak in full sentences.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.660 align:middle line:84%
He would just speak
in single syllables.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.825 align:middle line:84%
And his brother
was a chatterbox.

00:38:26.825 --> 00:38:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't know
what was wrong,

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and we took him to
see different people

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and got his hearing
tested and everything.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.790 align:middle line:90%
And he seemed to be fine.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.206 align:middle line:90%
Everything seemed to be OK.

00:38:34.206 --> 00:38:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were first learning
about trapped emotions

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we decided we
would work on him.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.295 align:middle line:84%
Now with twin boys
that are that age,

00:38:43.295 --> 00:38:45.420 align:middle line:84%
we decided we'd work on
them when they were asleep.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.450 align:middle line:90%
The subconscious never sleeps.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And we could not catch them
when they were awake, basically.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So I remember one night
my wife and I went in,

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.920 align:middle line:90%
and we did the emotion code.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And we explain in the
book how this is all done.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
with our son Drew

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:02.840 align:middle line:84%
was that he had inherited
an emotion of anger

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.872 align:middle line:84%
from my wife's father,
who was the rage-aholic.

00:39:06.872 --> 00:39:08.330 align:middle line:84%
He was a great man
in a lot of ways

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:11.070 align:middle line:84%
but he really had
a lot of anger.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.630 align:middle line:84%
My son Drew had inherited
that from grandpa.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:16.209 align:middle line:84%
So we released that from him
and a couple of other things.

00:39:16.209 --> 00:39:17.500 align:middle line:90%
He never knew we worked on him.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.820 align:middle line:90%
He was sound asleep.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The next morning at breakfast,
Drew, four years old,

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:84%
is speaking in full sentences
for the first time in his life.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.506 align:middle line:90%
He won't shut up.

00:39:29.506 --> 00:39:31.380 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I are looking
at each other like,

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.213 align:middle line:90%
are you seeing this?

00:39:32.213 --> 00:39:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This stuff works.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Our other son,
Rhett, got in trouble probably

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:90%
for something at some point.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.237 align:middle line:84%
And so had this thing about
me that initially people

00:39:48.237 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:90%
thought was kind of funny.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.106 align:middle line:90%
He called me bad doctor.

00:39:51.106 --> 00:39:51.980 align:middle line:90%
He'd say, bad doctor.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.146 align:middle line:84%
I'd try to be close to him
and he'd say, bad doctor.

00:39:54.146 --> 00:39:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Away.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.117 align:middle line:90%
And he'd swing at me.

00:39:57.117 --> 00:39:58.450 align:middle line:90%
And people thought it was funny.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
hard as a parent.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But we thought
he'd grow out of it

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.008 align:middle line:90%
and he didn't grow out of it.

00:40:03.008 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And this went on for
six months or more.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I remember
I was sitting across

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.180 align:middle line:90%
from him and my wife.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And I leaned forward
to give him a hug.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And he did the same thing,
you know, bad doctor, away,

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.810 align:middle line:90%
and you know, took a swing.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And man, all of that rejection
from him over all those months

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.010 align:middle line:90%
just hit me.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And I started to cry.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And my wife said,
you know, she said,

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.470 align:middle line:90%
maybe he has a trapped emotion.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And we had never considered
that for children at that point.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.690 align:middle line:90%
We were learning about this.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:34.560 align:middle line:90%
So I tested him.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.809 align:middle line:90%
He did have a trapped emotion.

00:40:35.809 --> 00:40:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And the emotion was
that it was grief.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:42.139 align:middle line:84%
It was that I had grief
about him about something.

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were always
breaking things.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.388 align:middle line:84%
And you know, twin
boys, you can imagine,

00:40:45.388 --> 00:40:47.640 align:middle line:84%
they were always
doing crazy things.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And we released that emotion
from him, and he got up

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and he walked over to me and
he put his arms around me.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was unbelievable.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And the next day I
went to my office,

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and I was telling
everybody this story.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was a woman
there, one of my patients.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said listen, she said,
my daughter might have this,

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.300 align:middle line:84%
because she said, my
husband is an airline pilot.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.650 align:middle line:90%
He's gone for days at a time.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And when he comes home, our
daughter runs and hides,

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and it breaks his
heart every time.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.290 align:middle line:90%
So I said, well, bring her in.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:90%
So she did.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.390 align:middle line:90%
We tested her.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.473 align:middle line:90%
She had a trapped emotion.

00:41:16.473 --> 00:41:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember what it was.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.110 align:middle line:84%
But she came in
the following week

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and she said, when
my husband came home,

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.310 align:middle line:84%
she ran and jumped
into his arms.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's powerful stuff.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk
a little bit more

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.250 align:middle line:84%
about children,
children who have

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:36.925 align:middle line:84%
been victims of various
kinds of abuse where maybe--

00:41:36.925 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.867 align:middle line:84%
what is the protocol for
working with a child?

00:41:43.867 --> 00:41:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Because they're under
age, you can't exactly

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.680 align:middle line:84%
ask for their permission
to work with them.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But do you ask the soul or
subconscious for permission

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:54.786 align:middle line:84%
through divination before
you begin work on the child?

00:41:54.786 --> 00:41:55.910 align:middle line:90%
That's question number one.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.350 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of questions.

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:00.580 align:middle line:84%
How do you have permission
to work on that being?

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, that's
a great question.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:05.290 align:middle line:84%
In the emotion code,
we teach and believe

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:09.190 align:middle line:84%
that it's very important
to get permission.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:13.067 align:middle line:84%
And what we're talking
about is not really

00:42:13.067 --> 00:42:14.650 align:middle line:84%
permission from the
subconscious mind,

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.830 align:middle line:84%
but actual permission from, for
example, the parent or guardian

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:20.740 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to work
on a child, permission

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.600 align:middle line:84%
from the next of
kin if you're going

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:84%
to be working on somebody who
is in a coma or something.

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.080 align:middle line:90%
But we believe that's important.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
is because we believe

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:84%
that it's part of our life
here to have our own agency

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and to have our
ability to choose.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is yes,
it is possible to go

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.540 align:middle line:84%
into someone's subconscious
mind and do work on them.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.962 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of an invasion
of what we believe--

00:42:54.962 --> 00:42:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and this is how we
look at it-- that it's

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:00.780 align:middle line:84%
kind of an invasion of their
privacy and their agency.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about it.

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:04.634 align:middle line:84%
If some weirdo lives
down the street from you,

00:43:04.634 --> 00:43:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and then he finally
tells you, hey, I've

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.569 align:middle line:84%
been working on your
subconscious mind for a year.

00:43:08.569 --> 00:43:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
gave me permission.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, you didn't
give him permission,

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.634 align:middle line:84%
and you wouldn't be
very happy about it.

00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
wonder how that works

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.220 align:middle line:90%
with children in particular.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So with
children, what we try to do

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:24.690 align:middle line:84%
is get the permission from
the parent or guardian.

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's your
child, if it's your child,

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.210 align:middle line:90%
you can work on that child.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But if that child becomes
an adult and is legal age,

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.640 align:middle line:84%
then you need to get
permission from that child.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.929 align:middle line:84%
Now if it's your own child
that you want to work on,

00:43:37.929 --> 00:43:39.720 align:middle line:84%
it's usually pretty
easy to get permission.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it isn't, and
you have to respect that.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But usually baking them the
right kind of pie or something,

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:50.110 align:middle line:84%
or bribing them with
something will usually work.

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, got that.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the
notion of divination

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:58.230 align:middle line:84%
comes in because we can do
this 1,000 different ways.

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are energy
tuning devices.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.040 align:middle line:90%
We're tuning forks.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.792 align:middle line:84%
So one of them you
talk about in the book

00:44:03.792 --> 00:44:05.250 align:middle line:84%
is the swaying
method, which I have

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:07.920 align:middle line:84%
been known to do in the
supplement aisle of the grocery

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.110 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.460 align:middle line:90%
And you can use pendulums.

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.480 align:middle line:90%
You can use rods.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.030 align:middle line:84%
You can use this with
the fingers and such.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how you come
to a place of clear divination

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:25.980 align:middle line:84%
where your personal
emotional attachments are not

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.390 align:middle line:90%
interceding.

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, let me just say
first of all that the emotion

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:35.370 align:middle line:84%
code and the other work that
we do, including the body code,

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:38.640 align:middle line:84%
we believe really came
about during those years

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:43.590 align:middle line:84%
that I was in practice and I
was asking for help from God

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:84%
or that higher
power, great spirit.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the first most
important thing that we teach

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:51.960 align:middle line:84%
is that before you go
to work on somebody,

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.130 align:middle line:84%
you make that connection because
the highest duty of the healer

00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:00.570 align:middle line:84%
is to act as a go-between
for that higher power.

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:02.320 align:middle line:84%
That's where the healing
power comes from.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.403 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first thing.

00:45:03.403 --> 00:45:04.690 align:middle line:90%
It's the most important thing.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:13.420 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is to forget
the expectation of the outcome.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a sense
you always want

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.324 align:middle line:84%
to expect that this is going
to work for this person.

00:45:19.324 --> 00:45:20.740 align:middle line:84%
What we teach
people is you always

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.200 align:middle line:84%
expect a miracle
is going to happen.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
working on them, you

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.500 align:middle line:84%
don't have an
expectation that oh,

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.696 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be a
trapped emotion of grief,

00:45:28.696 --> 00:45:31.070 align:middle line:84%
or this is going to be this,
or this is going to be that.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's going to
play out a certain way.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.020 align:middle line:84%
You have to just
be totally open.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And the old saying of
the holistic physician

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.320 align:middle line:84%
that I heard somewhere
many, many years ago

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.880 align:middle line:84%
is that anything
can cause anything.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we teach our
followers to really operate.

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:51.987 align:middle line:90%
Anything can cause anything.

00:45:51.987 --> 00:45:54.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a mind
that's just a blank slate.

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:58.270 align:middle line:84%
No expectations of outcome
except good results.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just seeing
the whole result, yeah.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that's
an important thing

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:07.420 align:middle line:84%
because you can
skew the results,

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:11.920 align:middle line:84%
whether you're using a
pendulum or a bobber,

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.420 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a
device that you might

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.450 align:middle line:84%
be using that's
a dowsing device,

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.020 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're using
some form of muscle testing.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.300 align:middle line:84%
You see, the subconscious
mind, I believe,

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:26.020 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like a puppy
and it wants to please you.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have a
certain expectation,

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:84%
you want things to
go a certain way,

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.290 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious mind will
instantly pick up on that,

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and it can skew the answers
to try to please you.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.080 align:middle line:90%
So you need to just be open.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:38.959 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:38.959 --> 00:46:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Got to be open.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in the case
of the 11-year-old boy

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and helping to cure his
friend of hydrophobia,

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.290 align:middle line:90%
how did that go?

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was he using
these protocols?

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Was he using divination?

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Was what was he doing?

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Because he was still a kid.

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:46:59.020 align:middle line:90%
He was using muscle testing.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:02.470 align:middle line:84%
In the book and we teach a
number of different methods.

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:04.120 align:middle line:90%
How to test other people.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.220 align:middle line:84%
The answer, generally,
coming back from a person,

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.053 align:middle line:84%
if the arm is strong,
the answer coming back

00:47:08.053 --> 00:47:09.310 align:middle line:90%
from the subconscious is yes.

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.320 align:middle line:84%
If the arm is weak,
the answer is no.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.594 align:middle line:84%
We teach this method,
the ring in ring,

00:47:14.594 --> 00:47:16.510 align:middle line:84%
if the answer is yes,
the rings stay together.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.130 align:middle line:84%
If the answer is no,
the rings will break.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:20.590 align:middle line:90%
This method, one finger.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
can't cling hard.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say, well, I
just don't know to trust it,

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and they're putting
all their muscle in it.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Oh, no,
that doesn't work.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.260 align:middle line:90%
I tried that.

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.040 align:middle line:90%
My fingers hurt for seven years.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just
tell them the secret

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.820 align:middle line:84%
of how you keep it relaxed but
still get a genuine response.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: I'll tell you.

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:42.250 align:middle line:84%
The two most common mistakes
people make with self-testing,

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.459 align:middle line:90%
number one is too much force.

00:47:43.459 --> 00:47:45.124 align:middle line:84%
So what I recommend,
if you're going to,

00:47:45.124 --> 00:47:47.050 align:middle line:84%
for example, do
this one, the amount

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.170 align:middle line:84%
of force that you can use would
be about the amount of force

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:53.290 align:middle line:84%
that you'd use if you're
grasping a ladybug

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.496 align:middle line:90%
in between your fingerprints.

00:47:55.496 --> 00:47:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, so very soft.

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Very soft, very soft.

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a
subtle change that's

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.500 align:middle line:90%
taking place in the body.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.457 align:middle line:84%
And you're just trying to
pick up that subtle change.

00:48:05.457 --> 00:48:06.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Use very little force.

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that most
people make a mistake with

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.700 align:middle line:84%
is they're focusing
on their fingers.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Now think about a person
who can type 60, 70, 80,

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.080 align:middle line:90%
100 words a minute.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.790 align:middle line:84%
They're flying along reading
something and typing,

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and their fingers
know what to do.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.005 align:middle line:84%
If they start looking at
their fingers, what happens?

00:48:24.005 --> 00:48:25.630 align:middle line:84%
They start making
all kind of mistakes.

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Their speed drops in half.

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with this.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:30.820 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing
the testing, you

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.890 align:middle line:84%
focus on the person
you're testing,

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:35.410 align:middle line:84%
you focus on the question
that you're asking,

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and you allow yourself to
have love and gratitude

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:41.860 align:middle line:84%
for this process and the person
that you're working with.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And you allow the test to take
place slightly disconnected

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.750 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And your body knows how to do
it, just like the touch typist.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Kids have no problem,
you see, picking this up.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:52.730 align:middle line:90%
They have no problem.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.813 align:middle line:84%
They haven't learned all
the things they can't do,

00:48:54.813 --> 00:48:57.040 align:middle line:90%
like we have learned as adults.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So in the book--

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.400 align:middle line:84%
we just have a few
minutes left, really--

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.372 align:middle line:84%
so in the book you have
all these lovely anecdotes.

00:49:03.372 --> 00:49:05.830 align:middle line:84%
I think I want to get one more
in because it's interesting,

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.965 align:middle line:84%
because it talks
literally about the body.

00:49:07.965 --> 00:49:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And people will know this
because you bought it up.

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Rage-aholic alcoholics,
anger-aholics.

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And this one was a
combination angry drunk.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:19.176 align:middle line:84%
Let's tell that story, and
then we'll get to all the tools

00:49:19.176 --> 00:49:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that you have in your
book for people to use.

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:22.091 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: OK, absolutely.

00:49:22.091 --> 00:49:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, the analogy-- if you
think about how the emotions,

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.750 align:middle line:84%
we believe, are produced
by the organs in the body.

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:35.231 align:middle line:84%
And the liver, we believe
one of the prime emotions

00:49:35.231 --> 00:49:37.730 align:middle line:84%
there-- and this, of course,
goes back to Chinese medicine--

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:39.320 align:middle line:84%
this goes back
thousands of years.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.550 align:middle line:84%
The prime emotion that the
liver produces is anger.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:45.654 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think about
the angry drunk, what

00:49:45.654 --> 00:49:47.320 align:middle line:84%
happens to people
when they're drinking?

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, the liver is having to
break down all that alcohol.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So the liver gets
overstimulated.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
the person starts

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:59.230 align:middle line:84%
feeling that frequency,
that emotion of anger

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:01.940 align:middle line:84%
as a byproduct of that
overstimulation of the liver.

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So they start breaking
things and hurting people.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.060 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you a story
about an actual person.

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.130 align:middle line:84%
There was a person
that came in to see me.

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:11.130 align:middle line:90%
A man came in to see me.

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:12.500 align:middle line:90%
He had a terrible low back pain.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.140 align:middle line:84%
It was about a nine
on a zero to 10 scale.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:16.730 align:middle line:84%
It had been going
on for a while.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:17.840 align:middle line:90%
It was really severe.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I found he had a trapped emotion
of anger, a ball of anger,

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.400 align:middle line:84%
if you can imagine, that was
causing his low back pain.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And I found out using
the emotion code.

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:29.610 align:middle line:84%
This had occurred
about 20 years before.

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:30.410 align:middle line:90%
And he remembered.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.560 align:middle line:84%
He went through some
traumatic, difficult stuff.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.740 align:middle line:84%
I released the emotion
and the pain was gone.

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.577 align:middle line:84%
It went from a 9
to zero in the time

00:50:37.577 --> 00:50:40.160 align:middle line:84%
it took to release the emotion,
which was about probably three

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.170 align:middle line:90%
seconds or four seconds.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.830 align:middle line:84%
He was thrilled he
couldn't believe it.

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:44.746 align:middle line:90%
It was like a miracle.

00:50:44.746 --> 00:50:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was grateful
that it worked so well.

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.478 align:middle line:84%
He left the office, and
a couple of days later,

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:49.590 align:middle line:90%
he came back in to see me.

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:51.035 align:middle line:90%
And he said, my back is great.

00:50:51.035 --> 00:50:52.160 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's unbelievable.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I need
to tell you, he said,

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.810 align:middle line:84%
when I came in here I had
another problem that I

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:58.310 align:middle line:90%
didn't tell you about.

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:00.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, for as long
as I can remember,

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I've basically
been a rage-aholic.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.915 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm always yelling
at my wife and my kids.

00:51:03.915 --> 00:51:05.456 align:middle line:84%
He said I got to
watch the road rage.

00:51:05.456 --> 00:51:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been to anger
management several times.

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:09.200 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't really done anything.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:13.432 align:middle line:84%
He said, but since you released
that emotion of anger from me,

00:51:13.432 --> 00:51:14.640 align:middle line:90%
I just feel kind of peaceful.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.210 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't understand.

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:18.310 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:19.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel the anger anymore.

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I feel different.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:21.330 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I
said, I have no idea.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's what we
talked about before.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.140 align:middle line:84%
That emotion was generated
in the liver or gall

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:32.710 align:middle line:84%
bladder, one of those,
most likely the liver.

00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And that emotion got stuck, that
energy got stuck in his body,

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:38.230 align:middle line:84%
where it was affecting
his low back.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:40.950 align:middle line:84%
20 years, you see,
of imbalancing

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:44.120 align:middle line:84%
those tissues, those energies
that make up those tissues.

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And then finally it
resulted in this pain

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.660 align:middle line:90%
that brought him to see me.

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:51.520 align:middle line:84%
But really the
other manifestation

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:55.004 align:middle line:84%
of that trapped emotion was
that he was a rage-aholic,

00:51:55.004 --> 00:51:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of that
emotion fixed the pain

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.035 align:middle line:90%
and the emotional trouble.

00:51:58.035 --> 00:51:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
makes total sense.

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think the other
part I was getting

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:02.654 align:middle line:84%
to-- the other half
of that correlation

00:52:02.654 --> 00:52:05.320 align:middle line:84%
on the person who was an
angry drunk in the book--

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.920 align:middle line:84%
is that by continuing
to drink, you're

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.275 align:middle line:84%
continuing to break down the
function, also, of the liver.

00:52:12.275 --> 00:52:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes, right.

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's
a never-ending cycle

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.830 align:middle line:84%
of reinforcement of that same
dense energy being released.

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Well, exactly.

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And the other fascinating
thing about this

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:26.990 align:middle line:84%
is the more trapped emotions you
have, the more trapped emotions

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.080 align:middle line:90%
you'll tend to create.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:32.470 align:middle line:90%
And think about that guy.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:34.270 align:middle line:84%
He had that ball of
anger in his back.

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:37.014 align:middle line:84%
Those tissues were literally
feeling that emotion 24/7.

00:52:37.014 --> 00:52:38.555 align:middle line:84%
So when a situation
would arise where

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:40.888 align:middle line:84%
he might tend to feel angry,
he'd slide right into that.

00:52:40.888 --> 00:52:44.470 align:middle line:90%


00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's amazing that now we're
starting to really understand

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.400 align:middle line:84%
how these things work,
how the body works,

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.730 align:middle line:90%
and it's not what we thought.

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:54.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So in the book you
have the tables

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:59.200 align:middle line:84%
that have the various emotions,
the organs and so forth, right?

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you also have
different methods of divination.

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And a person has
to play with it,

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:08.560 align:middle line:84%
make sure they're in that nice,
detached, clear space, right?

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And then is there anything
beyond that stopping a person

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:12.830 align:middle line:90%
from having success?

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: No.

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.150 align:middle line:90%
It's just a simple process.

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:19.420 align:middle line:84%
You learn to ask these questions
and you learn to get answers.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:23.530 align:middle line:84%
You learn to access your
own subconscious mind.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all
the good answers are.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And the subconscious
knows all of it.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So whatever method that you
choose to get those answers,

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.960 align:middle line:90%
it's really simple.

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the process might
work something like this.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, for example,
I'm working on you.

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you've got a
migraine headache, for example.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:44.350 align:middle line:84%
If I'm this close to
you, I can ask questions

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and get the answers on myself,
strong for yes, weak for no.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And I could simply ask, do you
have a trapped emotion that's

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:52.660 align:middle line:90%
contributing to your migraine?

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer comes
back yes, then what we do

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.026 align:middle line:90%
is we have a chart of emotions.

00:53:58.026 --> 00:53:59.650 align:middle line:84%
There's 60 emotions
in there divided up

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:01.590 align:middle line:90%
into two columns and six rows.

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And the organs are all
listed on the left.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:07.750 align:middle line:84%
But we just ask, is the emotion
in Column A or in Column B?

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And the body knows, the
subconscious mind knows.

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, when
I ask that question--

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.700 align:middle line:84%
or if you're working on
yourself you can ask that.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.658 align:middle line:84%
Do I have a trapped
emotion that's contributing

00:54:17.658 --> 00:54:20.450 align:middle line:90%
to my back pain or whatever?

00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.660 align:middle line:84%
If the answer is
yes, at that moment

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.651 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious mind
knows what the emotion is

00:54:25.651 --> 00:54:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and everything about it, when
it occurred, who was involved,

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:29.426 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:54:29.426 --> 00:54:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And so then at that
point, what we have to do

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.720 align:middle line:84%
is basically kind of play
charades with the subconscious

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.480 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what the
subconscious mind knows.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.250 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like that game
that people use on their phones,

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:42.190 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:43.540 align:middle line:90%
You just ask questions.

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.100 align:middle line:90%
The answers you get.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Is it in Column A?

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Column B?

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.900 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Is it in one of the
odd rows in Column A?

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Is it in Row One?

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:51.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Row Three?

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:52.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.885 align:middle line:90%
Is it this or this or this?

00:54:53.885 --> 00:54:55.852 align:middle line:84%
You find the emotion,
and then you ask,

00:54:55.852 --> 00:54:57.310 align:middle line:84%
do we need to know
more about this?

00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:59.857 align:middle line:84%
And if the subconscious
needs to have more brought

00:54:59.857 --> 00:55:02.440 align:middle line:84%
to conscious awareness before
it will allow that emotion to be

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.985 align:middle line:90%
released, it will say yes.

00:55:04.985 --> 00:55:05.860 align:middle line:90%
And then you can ask.

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Usually all you need to ask
is, well, when did this occur?

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it
occurred at some time

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.779 align:middle line:90%
that you might not realize.

00:55:11.779 --> 00:55:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you were five
years old or something.

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:14.879 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe you were in the womb.

00:55:14.879 --> 00:55:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
if you don't want

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:17.890 align:middle line:84%
to do it on yourself
or each other,

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:20.592 align:middle line:84%
you have what, 3,500
plus practitioners?

00:55:20.592 --> 00:55:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: That's right.

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:23.239 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So where do people go?

00:55:23.239 --> 00:55:25.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: They can go
to healerslibrary.com

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:29.320 align:middle line:10%
and they can find a
practitioner to work with them.

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.860 align:middle line:10%
Or they can also get
the book for free right

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:36.502 align:middle line:10%
now if they go to
emotioncodegift.com.

00:55:36.502 --> 00:55:37.960 align:middle line:10%
They can download
the book for free

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.450 align:middle line:10%
and download the book on
audio, also, for free.

00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
excellent, because it's

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:42.243 align:middle line:90%
really well-written.

00:55:42.243 --> 00:55:44.842 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of lively
anecdotes and so forth,

00:55:44.842 --> 00:55:46.550 align:middle line:84%
so it really keeps
you moving through it.

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:47.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: Lots of great stories.

00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:48.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It really does.

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:49.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: There's a whole
chapter on animals, by the way.

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:51.453 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
what we supposed

00:55:51.453 --> 00:55:54.370 align:middle line:10%
to get to because you can be
a surrogate for your pets.

00:55:54.370 --> 00:55:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: You can.

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:56.990 align:middle line:84%
They get trapped
emotions just like us.

00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:55:57.330 --> 00:55:59.163 align:middle line:84%
I read that and I
thought, oh, this is cool.

00:55:59.163 --> 00:56:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, thank you for adding
that in before we say goodbye.

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:03.979 align:middle line:90%
It's in the book.

00:56:03.979 --> 00:56:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: It is in there.

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.981 align:middle line:84%
It was, I think, a very
enlightening conversation

00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:08.920 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:09.880 align:middle line:90%
You'll be hearing from them.

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Thank you, Regina.

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:10.845 align:middle line:90%
It's been really fun.

00:56:10.845 --> 00:56:13.345 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the name of
the book is "The Emotion Code",

00:56:13.345 --> 00:56:15.220 align:middle line:10%
which you can find
at major booksellers.

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:18.250 align:middle line:10%
It explains in plain English
how trapped emotions work

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:20.440 align:middle line:10%
and how to release them,
as we just spoke of.

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us on "Open Minds".
