>>REGINA MEREDITH: The
bane of our existence,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:10%
particularly those from the
Western and secular world,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:10%
is both a fear of
aging and dying.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Millions of dollars
a year are spent

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
on pills and potions,
books and DVDs

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:84%
annually on the attempt
to stop the aging process.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But what if there was one
thing primarily responsible

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:84%
for aging, and
what if that thing

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:90%
could be reversed in the body?

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Would you take it?

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Would you want to live to
be hundreds of years old?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:84%
The search for an
end to old age is

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.639 align:middle line:84%
explored in the film,
"The Immortalist."

>>BILL ANDREWS: Hundreds
of years from now,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.480 align:middle line:84%
we're going to look
back and be shocked

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:84%
about this horrible
world that we all

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.935 align:middle line:84%
used to live in where people
used to get old and die.

>>AUBREY DE GREY:
We're interested

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.745 align:middle line:84%
not in slowing aging down,
but in actually reversing

00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:84%
it, turning back the
biological clock.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.715 align:middle line:90%
This is not science fiction.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Even if I bring
forward the defeat

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:84%
of aging by just one day, that's
100,000 lives that I've saved.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.625 align:middle line:90%
It's just astronomical.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:38.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Harvard
has actually been

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
able to reverse aging in mice
using telomere lengthening

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: Once we are
really, truly repairing things

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:84%
as fast as they go
wrong, game over.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:84%
We will have the ability
to live indefinitely.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.831 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Curing
aging is a race.

The clock ticks once,
telomerase pushes it back.

00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:05.884 align:middle line:84%
It ticks again,
telomerase pushes it back.

>>MOLLY SHERIDAN: If
Bill gets to his goal,

00:02:07.868 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
then our marraige is
forever and ever and ever.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Think about that one.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have two doctors
in the field of anti-aging

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:84%
recently featured in the
film, "The Immortalist"--

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Bill Andrews and Terry Grossman.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Welcome both of you.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of fun
interviewing a couple

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:90%
people at one time on this show.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
This is really a subject that
is the holy grail for probably

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:84%
most of humanity, because
of our innate fear,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:84%
as animals, of
declining and death.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, it's
such a huge topic.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.194 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find out-- some
of the people have not seen,

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
most of the people probably have
not seen "The Immortalist" yet.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So we need to get to know
you and what you're doing

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit
about the science.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's start first with Bill,
and then go to you, Terry.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: It was
a long time ago.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
When I was 10 years
old, I was already

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:84%
somebody that was
really interested

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:90%
in first contact in outer space.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I want to be around when
we actually met something.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I was actually looking
through a telescope

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.830 align:middle line:84%
at the stars and stuff
when my father came up

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:84%
to the front lawn of our
house, and said to me, "Bill,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
since you're so interested
in science and medicine,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:84%
maybe when you grow
up, become a doctor,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.589 align:middle line:90%
and find a cure for aging."

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
resonated with you

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:90%
when you were just a little guy?

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah, because
I thought, boy, if I ever

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:84%
want to be around when we
find life on other planets

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like that, I was
very interested in the future,

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:84%
whether it was life on other
planets or something else.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:10%
I was just very
interested in the future.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.632 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not going to
be around to see it

00:03:44.632 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:10%
if I live the short life
that everybody else lives,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.764 align:middle line:10%
so I became obsessed with the
idea of trying to cure aging.

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to
be involved in trying

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
to solve all the future
problems in science and things.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, we've got
to solve aging first,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:84%
just to make certain that I
can stay around long enough,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and other people can
stay around long enough

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.915 align:middle line:84%
to enjoy the future
that I think we have.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
as good a reason

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
as any to want to be part of
everything that's coming up.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.987 align:middle line:84%
So with that, in a
little bit, we're

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:84%
going to get into
some of the science,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.613 align:middle line:84%
because it is still an emerging
science, so to speak, right?

00:04:19.613 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes, it is.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it sounds
like the field of research

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
here is bringing up new
potentials, new what ends up

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.690 align:middle line:84%
being products and
active ingredients

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.864 align:middle line:84%
and such all the time that
are showing that they're

00:04:30.864 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
going to have this effect
on the science we'll

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.195 align:middle line:90%
be talking about in a bit.

00:04:34.195 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:90%
How about you, Terry?

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.835 align:middle line:90%
What got you into anti-aging?

00:04:36.835 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TERRY GROSSMAN:
I'd have to say

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.980 align:middle line:84%
that I got it into anti-aging,
because I began to recognize

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
that I was actually
experiencing aging.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.342 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another
good motivator.

00:04:46.342 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: It was a
personal experience.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I was 47 years of age at the
time, which was 20 years ago.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.440 align:middle line:10%
And at that time, I
saw an advertisement

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:10%
in a throwaway medical journal
for an organizational meeting.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
The group was called
A4M, the American Academy

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:90%
of Anti-Aging Medicine.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And back then, 20
years ago, there

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
was no such thing as
anti-aging medicine,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and I thought that
this is a really very

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:84%
different and profound
concept that we can actually

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:90%
use medicine to address aging.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.569 align:middle line:84%
So I went to this
meeting, and everything

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:90%
was turned around for me.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Back then, I was a
conventional doctor

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:84%
practicing medicine the way I've
been taught in medical school.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.019 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, I got
the idea that, wait a minute,

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
heart disease affects a certain
percentage of the population,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and cancer affects a certain
percent of the population,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.770 align:middle line:90%
but aging affects everybody.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So this was a disease that,
as an anti-aging physician,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I felt I could essentially
help everybody.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was interested in
myself, because at 47, 48,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I was beginning to get some
wear and tear in my own body,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and I thought if it
were possible for me

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.187 align:middle line:84%
to slow down, to stop and even
reverse the aging process,

00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:84%
this would be something
I was interested in.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:84%
There is an Indian
proverb that goes,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:84%
people get old and die, because
they see others around them

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:90%
get old and die.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm on board with that.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.780 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing, the programming.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.613 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSMAN: Exactly.

00:06:14.613 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I decided that I really
didn't want to buy into that.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
main anti-aging organ

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that we have really
is our brain,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and the way that you
think about aging,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and the way you think about
how you're experiencing

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:84%
your life in terms
of the aging process

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.666 align:middle line:84%
plays a very profound role
in how well you do age.

00:06:32.666 --> 00:06:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And to go a little
esoteric, in fact,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
flat out into religion and
the Old Testament, when there

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.960 align:middle line:84%
are references to Noah, for
example, living well into their

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Ninth century, 10th century?

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Now how do you perceive that?

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.940 align:middle line:84%
What do you think was
going on in the time--

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming it's literal
and not metaphorical,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know-- how
do you both perceive that?

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.504 align:middle line:84%
What humanity may have once
done as to where we are now?

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, I don't
think there's any way

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.044 align:middle line:84%
for us to know if
that happened or not,

00:07:05.044 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
but I am aware of
the possibility

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:84%
that the year was
defined differently.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It might have been they defined
a year as every full moon,

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.604 align:middle line:84%
and that would explain
900 plus years old.

00:07:15.604 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a
different calendar.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.853 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah, different
type of calendar.

00:07:18.853 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSMAN: I agree with Bill.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, up until the
time of the flood in Noah,

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:84%
there were individuals that
lived 800, 900, 960 years.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think given what
we know about biology,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:84%
humans can't live that long, and
I assume that humans of 5000,

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
6000, 7000 years ago didn't have
that much longer than we lived.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think that I agree
with Bill that what happened

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.779 align:middle line:84%
is considered a lunar
month as a solar--

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.736 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: So it
was a revolution

00:07:51.736 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
around the moon versus
a revolution of the sun,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, you know, 800
and some odd years for them

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
would have been 70
some odd years for us.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we just have
to address that, and then

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.540 align:middle line:84%
from your perspective,
get that off the table.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though
we somehow have

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:84%
devolved into this
current lifespan.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It's that this is the
nature of humanity.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And so your dad was also
a part of your journey.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: My father, he--

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.069 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Besides telling
you, find the answer, kid.

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: He's just
been obsessed with it.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
He's a television
producer, and he actually

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:84%
was starting to make
documentaries and stuff

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
like that on scientists
trying to cure aging,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.074 align:middle line:84%
I want to say back
in the early 1980s.

00:08:41.074 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And especially
later on in the early 1990s.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And so he's been always
obsessed with this,

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and he still is very
obsessed with it.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Though he's now suffering from
a lot of these related things

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that people try to avoid,
especially Alzheimer's.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.510 align:middle line:84%
He's got severe
Alzheimer's at the moment,

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:84%
so I'm hoping that we come
through with something fast

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:84%
to allow him to achieve
his dream, which

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.255 align:middle line:84%
was to see his own lifespan
and health span extended

00:09:13.255 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:90%
and his aging reversed.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
picked up the gauntlet.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to go into
the science and explain,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
have you explain the function
of telomeres in the body.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Because again, this holy
grail is getting down

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
to this one aspect of
our biology, right?

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So who would like to
go first on explaining

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the
science of telomeres?

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: What do you prefer?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.233 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Well, I'd
prefer Bill, because--

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Now you've been in
this for how long

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:84%
since you started bringing
telomere science forward?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.519 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: The field of
telomere biology since 1993.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And I will say to our viewers,
we're saying telomeres,

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
"teela-meres," "te-lom-a-rase,"
so you're going to hear this

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:90%
pronounced--

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: "Te-la-mer-ase."

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of a telomeres,
a variety of different ways,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and so far as we've
been able to understand,

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:90%
there's no right way.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.041 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: They're all correct.

00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're all correct.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: But first,
I believe there's

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things that
cause us to age.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And so oftentimes I'll
give presentations,

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'll show 20
different things, theories

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:90%
on what causes us to age.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And I just believe
in all of them.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I think of them as
a stick of dynamite

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:90%
that's burning inside of us.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So really what matters is
which stick of dynamite

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
has the shortest fuse, and I
think in humans-- humans, dogs,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
cats, horses, sheep, pig, and
deer are the only ones that

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
have been shown so far to
actually have telomeres,

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.280 align:middle line:84%
actually, telomere shorting
be their shortest fuse.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:50.907 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:10:50.907 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now explain what
telomere shortening is.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.073 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Telomeres-- OK.

00:10:54.073 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
The telomeres are the very
tips of our chromosomes.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
You think of a chromosome
like a shoelace.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
The caps or aglets
on your shoelaces

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.140 align:middle line:84%
are equivalent to the
telomeres on our chromosomes.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that when
the aglets on our shoelaces

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:84%
get short, our shoelaces
start to fall apart.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same is true
for our chromosomes.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
When the telomeres on our
chromosomes get short,

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.620 align:middle line:84%
our chromosomes
start to fall apart,

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and we actually can see these
in the microscope-- chromosome

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:90%
rearrangements.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it look of
frayed ends and fragmented, or?

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Not
exactly the same way.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:84%
A model with a telomere
shoelace isn't 100% correct,

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:38.350 align:middle line:84%
but what happens is that
the telomere protects

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
the chromosome, because
it's a linear chromosome,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and there's all kinds
of enzymes inside

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:90%
of a cell that can degrade DNA.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Telomeres kind of protect it.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
When they get
short, their ability

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
to protect decreases
tremendously,

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and their ability to be able
to regulate gene expression

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
on the chromosomes, the
rest of the chromosomes,

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:84%
changes a lot when
they get shorter.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have found,
or we-- when I say we,

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I mean
scientists that were doing

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
this research before
I got involved--

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.600 align:middle line:84%
we found that every
time our cells divide,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:84%
the telomeres get a
little bit shorter

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:90%
by about 50 to 100 bases.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.695 align:middle line:90%
And DNA's measured in bases.

00:12:22.695 --> 00:12:27.085 align:middle line:84%
A typical chromosome is about
100 million bases in length.

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And the telomeres are about
15,000 bases in length.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's how long they are
when we're first conceived,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.970 align:middle line:84%
but every time a
cell divides, they

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:84%
get about 50 to
100 bases shorter.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So much cell
division is involved

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.605 align:middle line:84%
from going from a single
cell embryo to a newborn baby

00:12:46.605 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
that even by the
time you're born,

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.990 align:middle line:84%
your telomeres have already
shortened down to 10,000 bases.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.086 align:middle line:90%
They've gone from 15,000--

00:12:53.086 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gone through
a third of them.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.376 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah.

00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Now that's still OK, just
like if your shoelace caps got

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
one third shorter, your
shoelaces would still be OK.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
doesn't stop there,

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:84%
because now we have
a lot more cell

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.454 align:middle line:84%
division that we go through
as we get older and develop,

00:13:09.454 --> 00:13:11.745 align:middle line:84%
and the telomeres just keep
getting shorter and shorter

00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and shorter, and when telomeres
get down to 5,000 bases--

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and we know this from working
with human cells in a Petri

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:84%
dish, and we also know this
from taking tissue samples

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:84%
from people of different
ages and measuring

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the length of their telomeres--
WHEN telomeres get down

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to 5,000 bases, that's when
everything starts happening.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.670 align:middle line:84%
That's when the chromosomes
start falling apart,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
our cells lose the ability
to function normally,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and every single disease
you've ever heard of

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.210 align:middle line:84%
has now been connected to
the length of the telomeres.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.669 align:middle line:84%
So when they get
short, it causes--

00:13:44.669 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:84%
it's not the only
thing that causes--

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:84%
but it plays a big role
in causing practically

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.090 align:middle line:84%
every age-related and
even non-age-related

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:90%
ailment that we've heard of.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we're trying to do.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to keep
that from happening.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.600 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
keep telomeres long.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:84%
The biggest discoveries in,
especially the last five years,

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:84%
have been showing that when
telomeres get really short,

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:84%
the chromosome starts
getting mutated, and--

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.348 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:14:10.348 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:84%
There must be a degrading
of genetic information

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:90%
with this continual breakdown.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens once
the genetic information has

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:90%
been degraded?

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: It never
gets-- the telomeres never

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
get short enough
to actually start

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.776 align:middle line:84%
degrading the
genetic information.

00:14:25.776 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do
the mutations occur?

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Mutations occur
just from, let's say,

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:84%
one way is from the
chromosomes rearranging.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So when a chromosome breaks
and rejoins, that's a mutation.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Especially when it rejoins
to a different chromosome.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it essentially puts
the expression machinery

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:84%
to express a gene under
control of some other gene.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And so different genes will be
expressed at different levels

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:90%
than they're supposed to.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.364 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us a
kindergarten example of that.

00:15:02.364 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: A
kindergarten example.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a gene
that produces blue eye color.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have a chromosome
rearrangement.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Now you put it under
control of a much stronger

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
what are called promoters that
drive the production of a gene,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:90%
or expression of a gene.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:84%
It now puts it under stronger
things, so as a result,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.140 align:middle line:90%
your eyes will get bluer.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.431 align:middle line:84%
But that would be the
kindergarten example.

00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:31.195 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The more non-kindergarten
example that I wanted to use

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.805 align:middle line:90%
was cancer.

00:15:36.805 --> 00:15:38.970 align:middle line:84%
When the telomeres
get really short,

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.470 align:middle line:84%
all these chromosomal
rearrangements

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.150 align:middle line:84%
occur and mutations
and stuff, and those

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:84%
appear to be the mutations
that actually cause cancer.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And so keeping
the telomeres long

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
has now been suggested as a way
to decrease the risk of getting

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:84%
cancer, and also increase
your immune system's ability

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to fight cancer if you
already have cancer.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So the same is true
for heart disease.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Same is true for
muscular dystrophy,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.930 align:middle line:90%
macular degeneration.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Every disease we've
practically ever heard of now

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
has been connected in some way
in scientifically peer reviewed

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.592 align:middle line:90%
journal articles.

00:16:17.592 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where my mind's
kind of just drifting

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:middle line:84%
to as you're speaking
about this is we

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
look at all of the
other areas of kind

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
of newly emerging science in
the world of quantum physics,

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
for example, in the
quantum realm and thoughts,

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and the thoughts affect, and
you said mind earlier on.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
The mind has a great
deal to do with this.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I want
to ask you that.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And then have you talk a bit
about in your clinic, some

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:84%
of the protocols you
use and such, because I

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
know that the products
that are becoming available

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:84%
are all newly emerging, and
you've been at this for awhile,

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and look at some of the
more common protocols you're

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:84%
using to extend the lifespan
or keep intact the telomeres.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.930 align:middle line:90%
But what about mind?

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.785 align:middle line:90%
How does mind factor into this?

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Well, Bill
works in the laboratory,

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and he's doing important work
to help us find substances that

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
can increase the length
of the telomeres.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.180 align:middle line:84%
In my clinic, I'm
working as a clinician

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.609 align:middle line:90%
taking care of patients.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:84%
So some of the things
that i like to do

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:84%
is measure the
length of telomeres.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So we can-- there are
now some tests that

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:84%
are available that
will tell patients

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:84%
how long their
telomeres are, and also

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.550 align:middle line:84%
what percentage of them
are particularly short.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is very valuable
information to know,

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:84%
because it's, essentially, a
yardstick for how we are aging.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So this test has become
commercially available

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.442 align:middle line:90%
in the last few years.

00:17:43.442 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're offering
that to patients,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and then based on this, we can
make recommendations, advice

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
to people about what they
can do in their own life

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
to extend the length
of their telomeres.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
some things that you

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.520 align:middle line:84%
can do that are simple,
they make a lot of sense.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Get good exercise.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Get plenty of deep sleep.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Drink green tea.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Take antioxidants.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Those are all lifestyle
choices that you

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
can make that will keep
your telomeres long.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.835 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
you can do to shorten them

00:18:16.835 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:84%
as much as possible is
to stress yourself out.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And they did an experiment where
they looked at spouses who were

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:84%
taking care of another
spouse with Alzheimer's.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is an
unbelievably stressful job.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And these people,
their telomeres

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:90%
shortened dramatically.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So we know that stress
will shorten telomeres.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
We also know that
getting massages,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.787 align:middle line:84%
relaxation, meditation,
things that you

00:18:44.787 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:90%
can do to control stress--

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.562 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Using the mind in
a more profound manner, yeah.

00:18:48.562 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN:
Absolutely-- are things

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.140 align:middle line:84%
that we could do to extend
the length of the telomeres.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.598 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that
from both your perspectives

00:18:54.598 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more--
the whole notion

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
of being kind of an
adrenal-addicted society,

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.620 align:middle line:84%
adrenaline-addicted society, and
what that's doing to our bodies

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:90%
in terms of aging.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Well,
unfortunately, our adrenals

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
are the glands in our body that
are responsible for helping

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:84%
us to deal with stress,
and we evolved in an era

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.420 align:middle line:84%
where we were subjected
to short bursts

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:90%
of huge amounts of stress.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Here comes a saber
toothed tiger.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We're stressed a
lot, so the cortisol

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:30.650 align:middle line:84%
squirts out of our adrenals,
and it tells us run, run fast.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:31.654 align:middle line:90%
Fight hard.

00:19:31.654 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Do what we need to do.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a fight or flight response.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
adrenals are supposed to do.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Then the danger is over.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:43.365 align:middle line:84%
We lay down and relax as we
did many, many millennia ago.

00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably until just
a couple hundred years ago,

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSMAN: Absolutely.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Industrial Revolution
life changed.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't live
like that today.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:84%
We don't have saber toothed
tigers to worry about.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:90%
But we do have chronic stress.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:90%
It's there all the time.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to worry about
paying the mortgage

00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and getting the kids
through college.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to say once money

00:20:01.425 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:84%
came onto the scene and
freeways and automobiles

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.807 align:middle line:90%
and private schools.

00:20:05.807 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: And all
these chronic stressors.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just
watching the evening

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:90%
news is a stressful experience.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're chronically
stressed all the time,

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.844 align:middle line:84%
and our adrenals aren't
accustomed to dealing

00:20:14.844 --> 00:20:17.347 align:middle line:84%
with this, and this takes its
toll on our telomeres as well.

00:20:17.347 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And there's been
scientifically peer reviewed

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
journal articles showing
that households that

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.006 align:middle line:84%
have higher incomes, so average
household income is actually

00:20:26.006 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:90%
affecting telomeres length.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:90%
So people--

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.016 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: --that have low
household income actually

00:20:31.016 --> 00:20:32.923 align:middle line:84%
have shorter telomeres
than families that

00:20:32.923 --> 00:20:36.690 align:middle line:84%
have high household income
because of the stress

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:90%
that financial problems cause.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of stress, like
in addition to the caregivers

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:84%
for Alzheimer's patients
that Terry just mentioned,

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
adults that had been abused
as children have been shown

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:84%
to have shorter telomeres
than adults that weren't.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And these were all compared
to people of all the same age,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and one was like abused as
children, and one wasn't.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a significant difference
in the telomeres length.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Now it's not because
some better lifestyle

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:90%
choices lengthen telomeres.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.120 align:middle line:84%
It's because it
prevents what I call

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:90%
accelerated telomere shorting.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Accelerated telomere
shortening is

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
caused from like
stress-induced production

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
of free radicals,
which have been shown

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:84%
to specifically
cleave telomeres.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Also inflammation
of various types

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:84%
will cause increased
cell division,

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
which will actually
shorten your telomeres.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a whole
battery of things

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:84%
that people can do to get
their telomeres to shorten

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:90%
at the slowest possible rate.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
name a few, and Terry

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:90%
can add to anything I leave off.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:53.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like antioxidants,
vitamin D, omega 3 fatty acids,

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:84%
endurance exercise-- that's
been one of the big surprises,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.150 align:middle line:84%
because endurance
exercise has always

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.490 align:middle line:84%
been thought of something
that actually creates

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:84%
more free radicals, and makes
it so that we die sooner.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:84%
But now studies are showing
that actually our ability

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
to actually boost our
antioxidant levels

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.270 align:middle line:90%
is so much more powerful.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who's a
consistent runner--

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like you.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.000 align:middle line:90%
You're a long distance runner.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I'm glad to say
I'm under that category,

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.630 align:middle line:84%
but I got into the
sport long before I

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:84%
knew about the benefits
to my telomeres.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's been shown that if
you're a consistent runner,

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:84%
you actually have
lower oxidative

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:90%
stress than non-runners.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.965 align:middle line:84%
And so the studies
have now shown,

00:22:38.965 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
at least five
different studies I

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.860 align:middle line:84%
know of in scientifically
peer reviewed journals

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.761 align:middle line:84%
have shown that the more
intense your endurance,

00:22:46.761 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:84%
the longer your telomeres with
ultra marathon runners having

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.240 align:middle line:90%
the longest telomeres of all.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that most
of the studies before now

00:22:54.740 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:84%
have been done on mice, and mice
have 10 times less antioxidants

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:90%
than humans do.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:84%
This is from a book
by Richard Cutler,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:84%
one of the pioneers of the whole
free radical theory on aging.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
problems with mouse studies

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
is that you can't always believe
what you see in mice that it's

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:90%
going to relate to humans.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But humans have 10 times
the level of antioxidants

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, the effects
of free radical production

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.502 align:middle line:90%
are a lot less than in mice.

00:23:27.502 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
at the same time,

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.930 align:middle line:84%
there are also
studies using mice

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:84%
having to do with what
has been, up until now,

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:84%
potentially controversial
aspect of this, which is cancer,

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of cancer,
and the telomere length

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.480 align:middle line:90%
having to do with cancer.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you'll explain that, and
then also some of the studies

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:84%
that have been done
conversely on mice

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.760 align:middle line:84%
to essentially show that
long telomere length does not

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.772 align:middle line:90%
indicate cancer.

00:23:53.772 --> 00:23:56.355 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Terry, first, did you
have anything to add that I--

00:23:56.355 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Well, these
lifestyle recommendations

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.090 align:middle line:84%
that Bill referenced
do make a lot of sense.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.155 align:middle line:84%
But by the same token,
you want to also avoid

00:24:04.155 --> 00:24:07.740 align:middle line:84%
the things that will shorten
your telomeres more quickly.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And those are
things that we know

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:12.780 align:middle line:84%
are bad like cigarette smoking
will do that, in addition

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:84%
to being stressed out a
lot, in addition to eating

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:16.990 align:middle line:90%
lot of sugar and junk foods.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Those will shorten your
telomeres quite quickly,

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
so making positive
lifestyle choices,

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and avoiding the bad
lifestyle choices.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the things that we
actually-- like they say,

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:84%
it's what we all
learned in kindergarten.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.661 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And I forgot to
mention smoking and obesity.

00:24:30.661 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
smoking and obesity.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.345 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Those things have
caused accelerated telomere

00:24:33.345 --> 00:24:33.844 align:middle line:90%
shortening.

00:24:33.844 --> 00:24:35.394 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and our ancestors,

00:24:35.394 --> 00:24:37.060 align:middle line:84%
they didn't live this
kind of lifestyle,

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.351 align:middle line:90%
but their average age was what?

00:24:38.351 --> 00:24:39.055 align:middle line:90%
About 45?

00:24:39.055 --> 00:24:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: A hundred years ago,
it wasn't much more than that.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:90%
About 48 in 1900.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And now it's increased to close
to 80 in the United States.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.789 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: In the
Roman days it was 20.

00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 20.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet we're under increasingly
more stress with modernization,

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:84%
but we also have better medical
care, access to nutrients,

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.180 align:middle line:84%
we can get in and out of the
rain, and that sort of thing.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Better sewage
systems, refrigeration.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Better
sewerage system.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Coronary
bypass surgery.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:07.199 align:middle line:84%
Even chemotherapy has extended
the average lifespan of people.

00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.656 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:25:08.656 --> 00:25:11.906 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the notion of
telomeres, cancer, and mice.

00:25:11.906 --> 00:25:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Of mice and men.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.855 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: It was
thought a long time ago--

00:25:17.855 --> 00:25:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and when I say a
long time ago, I'm

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.980 align:middle line:84%
talking about the early 1990s--
that one of the best ways

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%
to kill off a cancer is to allow
the telomeres to get really

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:90%
short.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Because as I said, every
time a cell divides,

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:90%
telomeres get short.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The definition of cancer is
out of control cell growth,

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.670 align:middle line:90%
cell division.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So the cells are
dividing and dividing,

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and the telomeres are
getting shorter and shorter.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, short telomeres
kill the cancer.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:90%
So don't worry about cancer.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:90%
So that was a lot of theories.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Plus, we had shown
back in the early 1990s

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that shortly after we discovered
human telomeres that if we

00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:00.475 align:middle line:84%
inhibited telomerase activity
in any way in cancer cells,

00:26:00.475 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:84%
it caused them to
die right away.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And lots of big press about
this, and so a common belief

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.930 align:middle line:84%
started that
inhibiting telomerase

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:84%
is the best way to fight
cancer, not producing it.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.089 align:middle line:90%
But what is--

00:26:16.089 --> 00:26:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Maybe you should
define what telomerase is.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Oh, we haven't
defined telomerase.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have not.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: OK.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Telomerase is-- so back
in the early 1990s,

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:84%
we knew that cancer
cells seemed to never run

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:84%
into this problem
of short telomeres.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.995 align:middle line:90%
It was-- what is happening?

00:26:37.995 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:84%
If you take a human
cell in a Petri dish,

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and divide it and divide
it in a Petri dish,

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:84%
it would divide at only
like about 50 times,

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.680 align:middle line:90%
and then it stops.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
Hayflick limit,

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.566 align:middle line:84%
and the cells reach a
point called senescence.

00:26:52.566 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Now cancer cells don't do that.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was found
that the telomeres

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:58.880 align:middle line:90%
don't shorten in cancer cells.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was found
that the telomeres are really

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:84%
short in cancer cells, they
just don't get any shorter.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Then it was also discovered that
our human reproductive cells

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:90%
also don't have that problem.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.950 align:middle line:84%
When our human
reproductive cells,

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
the cells that produce our
sperm and our eggs, divide,

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.200 align:middle line:84%
they don't get
telomere shortening.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:90%
And so what was going on here?

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.217 align:middle line:84%
And if they did shorten, then
that would mean our children

00:27:23.217 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:84%
were going to be born
with shorter telomeres

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:84%
than we have, and their children
would be born with shorter--

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We'd be extinct.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:28.995 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: We'd be extinct.

00:27:28.995 --> 00:27:30.140 align:middle line:90%
So something was going on.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So back in the early days when
I was a Geron Corporation,

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:84%
we were looking at cells that
don't have telomere shortening

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:90%
to find out why not.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, we discovered
an enzyme called telomerase.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:47.070 align:middle line:84%
It's produced in 85% to
95% of all cancer cells,

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's also produced only
in our reproductive cells.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the only normal
cell in our body

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:84%
where there's significant
levels of telomerase produced,

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.900 align:middle line:84%
enough to keep the
telomeres from shortening.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So we discovered this
enzyme in, I think,

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:84%
1993, somewhere
in the mid 1990s.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
first things we did

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.570 align:middle line:84%
was to put it into normal skin
cells grown in a Petri dish,

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and we found they
became immortal.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.970 align:middle line:84%
By the scientist's
definition of immortal,

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:84%
meaning that they never
reach the Hayflick limit.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:90%
They never got senescent.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.669 align:middle line:84%
They just kept dividing
and dividing, and they--

00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
weren't cancerous.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: They weren't cancer.

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is often confusing.

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:34.226 align:middle line:10%
The real definition of cancer
is lack of growth control.

00:28:34.226 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:84%
All our cells
divide, but they're

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:90%
told to stop at a certain point.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
growth control.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Cancers are where you
lose the growth control.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: And the interesting
thing about cancer cells

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.140 align:middle line:84%
are they express a lot of
telomerase, and as a result,

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.410 align:middle line:90%
they're immortal.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at
certain diseases,

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
like a very common
one is called CLL,

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:90%
chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:10%
And what happens in this disease
is our white blood cells,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:10%
they normally have a
certain life expectancy,

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:09.310 align:middle line:10%
and in CLL, because the
telomerase is active,

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:middle line:10%
every time the cell divides,
instead of a little bit

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:10%
of telomere length coming
away, this telomerase

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.450 align:middle line:10%
acts to stick it back on.

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So you'll start with a
white cell count of 5,000,

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.260 align:middle line:90%
which is normal.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And it should stay around 5,000,
and that's the normal range.

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But in this disease of
this type of leukemia,

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.580 align:middle line:84%
because the cells don't divide,
as because the cells don't die,

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and as the new cells are
formed, the next year your count

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:35.855 align:middle line:90%
is 10,000.

00:29:35.855 --> 00:29:37.614 align:middle line:90%
The next year it's 20,000.

00:29:37.614 --> 00:29:38.905 align:middle line:90%
Then the next year it's 80,000.

00:29:38.905 --> 00:29:40.440 align:middle line:90%
And the next year it's 150.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And it just keeps going up
and up and up, and eventually

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.100 align:middle line:84%
it kills patients,
because they have

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.580 align:middle line:84%
too many of these beneficial
white blood cells,

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.560 align:middle line:84%
because the cells
just don't die.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's really typical of
cancer is the cells don't die.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:54.439 align:middle line:90%
They're immortal.

00:29:54.439 --> 00:29:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: But if the
telomere's shortened,

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.970 align:middle line:84%
the cells would die because
of the cell division.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.190 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
it's interesting.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.652 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously people are
saying, wait a minute, but--

00:30:05.652 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: What
we'd like to learn

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.920 align:middle line:84%
is how we can make
ourselves copy cancer.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
express more telomerase

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:16.010 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't
die, and we also

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:20.285 align:middle line:84%
want to know how we can stop
this telomerase from protecting

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:84%
the cancer cells,
so we can kill them.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:23.150 align:middle line:90%
So we're interested.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.005 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are working
in both directions.

00:30:25.005 --> 00:30:26.421 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: The
simple way to think

00:30:26.421 --> 00:30:30.090 align:middle line:84%
of it is that a cell lives
longer if it has telomerase.

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.780 align:middle line:84%
That is true for normal
cells and our cancer cells.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just like
eating carbohydrates.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.430 align:middle line:84%
When you eat, you're feeding
all the cells of your body,

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.660 align:middle line:90%
including your cancer cells.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Now are we going to cure our
cancer by starving ourselves?

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
figure out some way

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:54.710 align:middle line:84%
of allowing our normal cells
to benefit from the things

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that cancer's benefiting
from without the cancer

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.440 align:middle line:84%
cells benefiting anymore
than they already are or even

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:90%
less than they are.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Now what has been
shown is that when

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:11.820 align:middle line:84%
we inhibit telomerase
to cure cancer cells,

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:84%
that only makes the
telomeres shorter.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.430 align:middle line:84%
The cells go into a
stage called crisis

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.062 align:middle line:84%
if they're not
already in crisis.

00:31:17.062 --> 00:31:18.520 align:middle line:84%
They go into a
stage called crisis,

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of chromosomal
rearrangements occur.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the
cell with various mutations

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.610 align:middle line:84%
learns how to keep
the telomeres long

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:28.666 align:middle line:84%
through some other mechanism
besides telomerase.

00:31:28.666 --> 00:31:29.540 align:middle line:90%
And this is the big--

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
this teaching science?

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, it's
teaching us that--

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean cancer cells
are so hardy, and as you say,

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.969 align:middle line:90%
immortal.

00:31:35.969 --> 00:31:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Cancer's been
a big problem since long

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:40.025 align:middle line:84%
before Nixon declared
a war on cancer.

00:31:40.025 --> 00:31:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But what are you
learning about it?

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:46.450 align:middle line:84%
It seems like that would be
one of your greatest teachers

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.975 align:middle line:84%
to unlock the secrets
of immortality.

00:31:48.975 --> 00:31:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I think what
we're learning now,

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.035 align:middle line:84%
and we're on the verge of it,
is the best way to fight cancer

00:31:54.035 --> 00:31:56.850 align:middle line:84%
is to actually keep
telomeres long.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Because then we don't
get the mutations

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:90%
that cause anything else.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Now we can also inhibit--
we can first find ways

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:84%
to poison telomerase
positive cells,

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.500 align:middle line:84%
but do it in a way that doesn't
allow telomere shortening.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, the
cancer cells would die,

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and then after the
cancer cells die,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
then turn on telomerase
and all the other stuff.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:84%
You could actually do
it at the same time,

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.910 align:middle line:84%
because most cancers are
already telomerase positive.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.210 align:middle line:84%
But you can turn it on
in the non-cancer cells

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
after the cancer's died, and
then lengthen the telomeres

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.282 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy tremendously
better health.

00:32:37.282 --> 00:32:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Has this been done?

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is this being
experimented with now?

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: No telomerase
inducer has been discovered yet

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:48.930 align:middle line:84%
that is potent enough to
actually lengthen telomeres.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.562 align:middle line:84%
Now some things on
the market right now

00:32:50.562 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:84%
have been shown to
be potent enough

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to lengthen the
shortest telomeres.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But the average telomeres
still get shorter,

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't done
enough research yet,

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:84%
but I'm speculating
right now that these--

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:90%
let's say an example is TA-65.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Another example is
Product B from Isagenix.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Both of these are natural
products that we have shown

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.960 align:middle line:84%
in our lab do induce the
production of telomerase

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.900 align:middle line:90%
in human cells.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
TA-65 has actually had a
clinical study now completed,

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.340 align:middle line:90%
and they've got more underway.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.000 align:middle line:90%
So has Isagenix.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's been shown that
when people are taking TA-65,

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:30.410 align:middle line:84%
their shortest
telomeres will actually

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.390 align:middle line:84%
get a little bit longer,
even though the longer

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.640 align:middle line:90%
ones will still get shorter.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:84%
The shortest one gets
a little bit longer,

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and that seems to provide
tremendous health benefits.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's
happening is they'll

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.910 align:middle line:84%
get a little bit shorter,
and then stop there.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And so low levels of telomerase
will allow the shortest ones

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.070 align:middle line:84%
to maintain themselves, whereas
the other ones are still

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:90%
getting shorter.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's questionable how
long these kind of treatments

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.760 align:middle line:84%
will take, but my
company is trying

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.940 align:middle line:84%
to produce even stronger
telomerase inducers that

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.289 align:middle line:84%
will actually lengthen even
the average telomere length.

00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
something like that,

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.284 align:middle line:84%
then that's when we can
start asking these questions.

00:34:11.284 --> 00:34:12.409 align:middle line:90%
What will it do for cancer?

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.034 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll be the
first one to admit,

00:34:14.034 --> 00:34:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm 99% percent certain that
telomerase will actually

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.739 align:middle line:84%
decrease the risk
of getting cancer.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It's short telomeres
that cause cancer.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.739 align:middle line:84%
I think the lack of telomerase
is actually causing more cancer

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:90%
than telomerase could ever do.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.854 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some people
might be saying, well,

00:34:30.854 --> 00:34:33.100 align:middle line:84%
aren't you messing
with mother nature?

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.429 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't the body
essentially structured in

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:40.192 align:middle line:84%
such a way that it has its
own perfect mechanisms?

00:34:40.192 --> 00:34:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: We've been
doing that forever.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Eyeglasses are a
perfect example of that.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:42.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:42.905 --> 00:34:43.900 align:middle line:90%
We have been.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.600 align:middle line:90%
What is?

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Eyeglasses.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Eyeglasses.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:46.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I understand what you're saying.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:84%
If only cancer cells
and reproductive cells

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:56.370 align:middle line:84%
have normally high amounts of
the secretion of telomerase,

00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:01.650 align:middle line:84%
then is it, I mean, you've
already answered the question.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it kind of messing with
the potentials of the body

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:07.910 align:middle line:84%
to introduce that in
for all cells to enjoy?

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Well,
living longer is really

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:84%
what the goal of
medicine has been.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: So that's
what we're doing.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
there's anything.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No
different than taking

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.130 align:middle line:84%
vitamins or minerals
or anything else.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:20.588 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: We're
using antibiotics

00:35:20.588 --> 00:35:22.350 align:middle line:90%
to treat a bad infection.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.110 align:middle line:84%
We're taking out a
ruptured appendix.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just sounds so
profound and so essential

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:30.870 align:middle line:84%
talking about life on
that level of chromosomes.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to ask you too, the
products you were talking about

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.900 align:middle line:84%
are almost all
botanically based?

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Some of them are.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.190 align:middle line:84%
The ones available
in the United States.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:43.500 align:middle line:84%
There's other products,
skin care products

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.600 align:middle line:84%
that are available in
South Korea and Australia,

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.205 align:middle line:84%
New Zealand, some
places in China, Japan

00:35:50.205 --> 00:35:55.350 align:middle line:84%
that are-- and hopefully
soon in the UAE and Denmark.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:84%
These are skin products
that will contain

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.670 align:middle line:84%
synthetic chemicals
that are very

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.260 align:middle line:90%
powerful telomerase inducers.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Still not powerful enough
to actually reverse

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.144 align:middle line:84%
aging, but plenty powerful
enough not to slow down aging.

00:36:08.144 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, when I say
they're not potent enough

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.850 align:middle line:84%
to reduce aging, even
the natural products

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.970 align:middle line:84%
are showing age reversal
in testimonials and stuff.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.754 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know
really how to measure

00:36:18.754 --> 00:36:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a very
new science still.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Very,
very new science.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You referred
to a test earlier.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.930 align:middle line:90%
How reliable is the test?

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Is it like a blood test where
you're just getting a snapshot,

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.750 align:middle line:84%
but it's a dynamic that's
changing all the time in terms

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.950 align:middle line:84%
of telomere length, or
how reliable is this test?

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Well,
it's new technology.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's not as reliable
as it needs to be,

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.130 align:middle line:90%
but it's what we have so far.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's been
perfected every year.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.706 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a perfect test yet.

00:36:49.706 --> 00:36:51.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I assume you
both have taken this test

00:36:51.705 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:84%
or have repeatedly,
and you're learning

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.820 align:middle line:84%
about what's happening
in your own bodies,

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and what are you
both discovering?

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.222 align:middle line:84%
And I assume you're
using product?

00:36:59.222 --> 00:36:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.170 align:middle line:90%
You're using product.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.930 align:middle line:84%
You're using your
protocols, and what are you

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:03.888 align:middle line:90%
finding in your bodies?

00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:90%


00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I've been
finding that my running has

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.150 align:middle line:90%
improved dramatically.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:84%
At 60 years old, I broke
every distance record

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever had.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I've been running--
competing and running

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:23.070 align:middle line:84%
since I was 10 years
old, but when I was 60,

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I broke my-- I didn't
break my one-mile record,

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.925 align:middle line:90%
but I broke my 5K record.

00:37:29.925 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't break my 10K record,
but I broke everything

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:36.390 align:middle line:84%
above that, so my half marathon,
my marathon, my 50-mile,

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:39.260 align:middle line:90%
my 50K, my 100K, my 100-mile.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.160 align:middle line:90%
All those records fell.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:84%
My ultra marathon running was
only since I was in, we'll say,

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:84%
early 40s, which
was 20 years ago.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:55.890 align:middle line:84%
But I still broke all
those records at 60,

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and really, the only
thing I've been doing

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:01.900 align:middle line:84%
is doing everything I can
to lengthen my telomeres.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I've also seen age
spots disappear

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:06.610 align:middle line:84%
on my hands and my vision
getting better, and like three

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:08.367 align:middle line:84%
ophthalmology
appointments in a row.

00:38:08.367 --> 00:38:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is primarily
from the various products that

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:84%
are being developed, and
you've been embracing?

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Historically, I'm
a pharmaceutical scientist.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.008 align:middle line:84%
I've been involved in a
lot of pharmaceuticals,

00:38:17.008 --> 00:38:20.660 align:middle line:84%
so I tend not to
believe in testimonials.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:84%
But I've been through so
many clinical studies,

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I kind of like find myself
immune to placebo effects,

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.317 align:middle line:84%
but what's going on
with me, I don't know.

00:38:30.317 --> 00:38:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not
a placebo effect.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.820 align:middle line:84%
You have very young
looking hands, by the way.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:34.695 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Thank you.

00:38:34.695 --> 00:38:37.780 align:middle line:84%
But I think, I'm
not going to stop

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.310 align:middle line:90%
taking my telomerase inducers.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing everything
I can to keep

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.457 align:middle line:84%
my telomeres as
long as possible.

00:38:42.457 --> 00:38:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
your experience, Terry?

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Well, I
do a lot of things

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:52.010 align:middle line:84%
for trying to slow down and
reverse the aging process.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And telomere lengthening
strategies are one of them,

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:01.370 align:middle line:84%
but I do things hormonally, I
do things detoxification wise,

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.340 align:middle line:90%
so I do a lot of things.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Do a lot of
supplementation, et cetera.

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that as
I go year by year,

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:15.400 align:middle line:84%
the clock is not really
winding down as quickly as it

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.910 align:middle line:84%
is for many of my friends,
people of my own age

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:19.420 align:middle line:90%
that I see.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it is possible
to slow down the aging

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.660 align:middle line:84%
process quite a bit by doing
any of these strategies.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And by putting
them all together,

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:33.410 align:middle line:84%
it can create a very robust
mechanism for, essentially,

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:36.109 align:middle line:90%
moving into your later years.

00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: How often do you
go to high school reunions?

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.899 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: I don't
do that anymore,

00:39:39.899 --> 00:39:42.740 align:middle line:84%
because I went to a
40th college reunion,

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and I still have
nightmares about that.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:46.970 align:middle line:90%
There's a disconnect there.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.761 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I go to my
high school reunions,

00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:51.175 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like, they're
a bunch of old people now.

00:39:51.175 --> 00:39:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: They definitely say,
Bill, how come you're so young?

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:55.638 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:39:55.638 --> 00:39:56.180 align:middle line:90%
It's sad.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:56.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking about
all the things you do,

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.550 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with detoxing,
hormone supplementation,

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.450 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Now doing that array
of things, protocols,

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:10.022 align:middle line:84%
does that have the net effect
of lengthening the telomeres?

00:40:10.022 --> 00:40:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSMAN: Absolutely.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.000 align:middle line:90%
I believe that they do.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're doing
all of these things combined,

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.210 align:middle line:84%
whereas for you, you're all
exercising and obviously

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:90%
eating well.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:21.870 align:middle line:84%
But you're really looking
more to the pharmaceutical,

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.980 align:middle line:84%
whether botanical or whatnot,
the pharmaceutical view

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.430 align:middle line:90%
of lengthening the telomeres.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I'm not focused
on anything anymore.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm focused on everything.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On everything.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.554 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:30.554 --> 00:40:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I don't know if we
can say that, unless, Terry,

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.761 align:middle line:84%
you have some data that
suggests otherwise,

00:40:34.761 --> 00:40:37.640 align:middle line:84%
that you're actually lengthening
telomeres, or just decreasing--

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Decreasing
the breakage.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Decreasing-- OK.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Decreasing--

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.217 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Slowing down
the rate of shortening.

00:40:44.217 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And now a lot of
people watch the film,

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and say, who's the
guy with the big beard

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.760 align:middle line:90%
and the British accent?

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And they want to know a
little more about-- he's

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.500 align:middle line:84%
a fascinating character
that's carried

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.350 align:middle line:84%
throughout the film,
The Immortalist."

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And his name is
Aubrey, Aubrey de Grey.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And tell us a little
bit about him,

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.790 align:middle line:84%
because people
watching this are going

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.949 align:middle line:84%
to want to know more
about him as well.

00:41:07.949 --> 00:41:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I would almost
consider Aubrey de Grey

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.960 align:middle line:90%
one of my best friends.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:17.640 align:middle line:84%
He and I have known each other
for maybe 10, 15 years now.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.845 align:middle line:84%
We both share a very big passion
about trying to cure aging.

00:41:22.845 --> 00:41:24.470 align:middle line:84%
We have different
approaches and stuff.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:25.803 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's his background?

00:41:25.803 --> 00:41:28.010 align:middle line:84%
His background-- well,
that's a good question.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: He's an engineer,
I believe by training.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:31.455 align:middle line:90%
He's an engineer right now.

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:33.038 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's
obviously a genius.

00:41:33.038 --> 00:41:34.027 align:middle line:90%
He's a brilliant guy.

00:41:34.027 --> 00:41:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: He actually
hasn't been somebody that's

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.210 align:middle line:84%
worked in the laboratory
doing science,

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:84%
but he sure studied it a
lot because of his obsession

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.150 align:middle line:90%
to cure his own aging.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to
be younger again,

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.480 align:middle line:84%
so that's why he and
I are good friends

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.720 align:middle line:90%
is we share that same passion.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.650 align:middle line:84%
But he's also very,
very open-minded.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:57.977 align:middle line:84%
He's a sponge for
learning new things.

00:41:57.977 --> 00:41:58.560 align:middle line:90%
He's learning.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.480 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to put together the
models to explain everything,

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.850 align:middle line:84%
because he just wants to
really be younger himself.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.810 align:middle line:84%
He's not looking for
fame and glory, which

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.380 align:middle line:90%
is one thing I like about him.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.560 align:middle line:90%
He can't wait to be a nobody.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he has amassed a
very high degree of knowledge

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.010 align:middle line:90%
in the area.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:14.635 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes.

00:42:14.635 --> 00:42:15.269 align:middle line:90%
Extremely high.

00:42:15.269 --> 00:42:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.060 align:middle line:90%
And he took that knowledge.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to roll a
bit of video in a minute.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:84%
He took that
knowledge to England

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.580 align:middle line:90%
into an academic environment.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about the
group he spoke in front of.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: This was a debate.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Colin Blakemore is a
scientist in England

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:36.030 align:middle line:84%
that argued that we
shouldn't be doing anything

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.400 align:middle line:90%
to extend lifespan.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've never been really
positive about debates,

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:45.540 align:middle line:84%
because they got these
rules and stuff like that.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.279 align:middle line:90%
So we don't really--

00:42:47.279 --> 00:42:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're now
looking at the outcome.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:50.945 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to show
a little clip of how

00:42:50.945 --> 00:42:52.042 align:middle line:90%
Aubry presented.

00:42:52.042 --> 00:42:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: He did a
great job presenting.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was mostly
medical students and people

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.450 align:middle line:90%
he was speaking in front of?

00:42:58.450 --> 00:42:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I don't know
who the audience was.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.820 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:01.572 align:middle line:90%
So I think--

00:43:01.572 --> 00:43:03.822 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I would imagine
it was just general public.

00:43:03.822 --> 00:43:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: General public.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:05.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:06.030 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at how Aubrey spoke

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.740 align:middle line:84%
about the notion of our
rights to immortality

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.490 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the soundbite
is going to say.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:16.992 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.992 --> 00:43:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DE GREY: If you oppose
this motion, in other words,

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.130 align:middle line:84%
if you're thinking that you
don't want to defeat aging

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:26.000 align:middle line:84%
entirely, then you must be
holding one of two positions.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Either there is
some age at which

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:32.010 align:middle line:84%
you think it is good
for people to get sick,

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:36.110 align:middle line:84%
or there is some age at which
you think it is good for people

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.400 align:middle line:84%
to die, even if they're
perfectly healthy.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.150 align:middle line:84%
They both sound pretty
ageist, don't they?

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:44.280 align:middle line:84%
The only reason that
we regard medicine

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.770 align:middle line:84%
for old people in
a different way

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.228 align:middle line:84%
than medicine for young people
today is because of the fact

00:43:48.228 --> 00:43:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have good
medicine for old people today.

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.524 align:middle line:84%
There is not an argument for
not developing that medicine.

00:43:53.524 --> 00:43:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Many people, when we
talk about this question,

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.231 align:middle line:90%
they say, oh, dear.

00:43:56.231 --> 00:43:57.620 align:middle line:90%
What if we have too many people?

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:59.770 align:middle line:84%
What we have is a dramatic
decline in the death

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:02.000 align:middle line:84%
rate, people carrying
on being born,

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.620 align:middle line:84%
far too many people, massive
environmental problems,

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.820 align:middle line:90%
don't want to go there.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we will But
maybe we won't.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:12.720 align:middle line:84%
We know nothing
about what the birth

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.060 align:middle line:84%
rate is going to be
100 years from now.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.010 align:middle line:84%
We know nothing at all
about other technologies

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:19.580 align:middle line:84%
that may reduce our
carbon footprint

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.955 align:middle line:84%
and thereby increase
the carrying

00:44:20.955 --> 00:44:23.550 align:middle line:84%
capacity of the planet,
thereby eliminating the problem

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:24.830 align:middle line:90%
in another way.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.230 align:middle line:84%
The scenario that we
should be avoiding

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.160 align:middle line:84%
is a scenario in which
humanity of the future

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.840 align:middle line:84%
looks back and blames us
for not developing medicines

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:84%
against aging, and thereby
for condemning them

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.920 align:middle line:84%
to an unnecessarily miserable
old age and an unnecessarily

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.070 align:middle line:84%
early death, just
because we thought

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:45.649 align:middle line:84%
we were so clever about how
the world was going to be,

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:48.065 align:middle line:84%
and we thought that it was
actually doing them a favor not

00:44:48.065 --> 00:44:49.580 align:middle line:90%
to develop these medicines.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.567 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be blamed
by our descendants,

00:44:51.567 --> 00:44:52.900 align:middle line:90%
and I don't think you do either.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.686 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:44:55.686 --> 00:44:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In this casual debate,
he ended up losing the debate,

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and part of it was
because people simply

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.670 align:middle line:84%
can't embrace that
our human race,

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:05.490 align:middle line:84%
along with the other
species as well,

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:07.464 align:middle line:84%
don't have a built-in
expiration date.

00:45:07.464 --> 00:45:09.130 align:middle line:84%
That's hardwired into
us, and we already

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.200 align:middle line:84%
know from the realm
of research that's

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.810 align:middle line:84%
being done in the field of
how mind affects physiology

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.580 align:middle line:84%
in quantum science from
Bruce Lipton's work

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, epigenetics,
that the mind very much affects

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.970 align:middle line:84%
all aspects of the
body's functioning.

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yes.

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't understand why
Aubrey lost that debate.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:35.156 align:middle line:84%
I thought he did a great
presentation in support of it.

00:45:35.156 --> 00:45:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think, again, it's
the resistance to this one

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:38.950 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Are we entitled to live past
our normal expiration date

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.660 align:middle line:90%
as a species?

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:48.140 align:middle line:84%
You feel that we should not
expect that we must die,

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that we should become
exempt from the process

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:53.320 align:middle line:90%
of physical death?

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
there's lots of reasons

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.990 align:middle line:90%
why we should be living longer.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The question is why do we
have such short lifespans

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.570 align:middle line:90%
to begin with?

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
best explanations

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.820 align:middle line:84%
for that is that
bottom line is there's

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.270 align:middle line:84%
no evolutionary advantage
to living longer

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.600 align:middle line:84%
than it takes to
raise our young.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.980 align:middle line:84%
After that, we just
get in the way.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And so in an
evolutionary sense, if we

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:24.140 align:middle line:84%
want to adapt to a
changing environment,

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.730 align:middle line:84%
we have to be shuffling
our genes all the time.

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And the way to shuffle
our genes the best

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:36.310 align:middle line:84%
is to allow our children to
find mates and reproduce and et

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:37.070 align:middle line:90%
cetera, et cetera.

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And if the old, let's
say, animals or humans

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:45.080 align:middle line:84%
don't die off, then the
young could never compete.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
that's why we evolve

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.150 align:middle line:84%
this whole business of
shortening our lifespans.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:56.990 align:middle line:84%
But humans now, we've gotten--
I know several examples

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:58.420 align:middle line:84%
of why I would
disagree with what

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to say-- but we've
gotten smarter than evolution.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We have learned how to
adapt by using our brains.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Adapt to changing
environments and things.

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we can
survive as a species

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:20.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot better by undoing all the
things that evolution has done,

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and including creating
an aging process.

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.385 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Well,
just consider what

00:47:25.385 --> 00:47:30.190 align:middle line:84%
an enormous waste it is
when an individual dies.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean a person
at 80 years of age

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.880 align:middle line:84%
has all of those
years of experience

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and all that wisdom that has
been achieved through all

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:46.070 align:middle line:84%
of those decades of
living, and when they die,

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:84%
that disappears from-- I
mean, the economic costs

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:52.460 align:middle line:84%
are enormous, and if we
didn't have that loss,

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.100 align:middle line:84%
it would be a boon
to civilization,

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.130 align:middle line:84%
to humankind to have all of
this additional knowledge

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:00.630 align:middle line:84%
be available for a
longer period of time.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're only supposed
to live for 30 years

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.110 align:middle line:90%
evolutionarily.

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:07.410 align:middle line:84%
15 years to become sexually
mature, then reproduce,

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and then another 15 years to
raise the next generation.

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Then at 30, the aging
process kicks in,

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:14.310 align:middle line:90%
and we're supposed to go away.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, we've been increasing
that steadily until now.

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Many people are living
into their 80s and 90s,

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and I think in the decades
later in this century,

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:27.930 align:middle line:84%
it's going to go beyond
150 years into 200,

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and then people will
be living in centuries.

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be a whole
different ball game for us.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you feel that
also that it's our birthright,

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.720 align:middle line:84%
if not to achieve
immortality, certainly

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.310 align:middle line:84%
to be working
toward immortality?

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Well, I think
that, certainly, most of us

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:51.130 align:middle line:84%
believe that life is
inherently good and valuable.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:53.110 align:middle line:84%
We love the fact
that we're alive.

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:54.790 align:middle line:90%
We look forward to the next day.

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is an incredible
blessing to all of us

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.210 align:middle line:84%
to have this gift
of life, and I think

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:03.140 align:middle line:84%
that anything we can
do to extend that.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.010 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
think that, well,

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:08.604 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to live to be
120, because I'll be decrepit,

00:49:08.604 --> 00:49:11.020 align:middle line:84%
I'll be in a wheelchair, I'll
have a poor quality of life.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
we're talking about.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.510 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about--

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Extending
quality of life.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:20.306 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Yeah, where they
say that 60 is the new 40,

00:49:20.306 --> 00:49:21.986 align:middle line:90%
and now 80 is the new 60.

00:49:21.986 --> 00:49:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we're just going

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.550 align:middle line:84%
to continue to do that to where
people will be 100 and 120

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and still enjoying a vigorous
life into the future.

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So extending life
like that, I think,

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:36.210 align:middle line:84%
is an extremely
valuable thing to do.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: And maybe
the reason Aubrey

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.390 align:middle line:84%
lost that debate
is you're right.

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the people in the audience
couldn't comprehend that

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:45.100 align:middle line:84%
completely, because
it was so new to them.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that if people
thought about it more,

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and they realized
that we're not talking

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:51.960 align:middle line:84%
about creating a
lot of old people.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.880 align:middle line:84%
We're creating a
lot of old people

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.096 align:middle line:90%
that are young and healthy.

00:49:55.096 --> 00:49:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
where a lot of people

00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.050 align:middle line:84%
go with that, if they've given
it any consideration at all,

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:04.270 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, my god, what if
we start living to be 200?

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.640 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the
planet, the population,

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.230 align:middle line:84%
the size of the
population, the resources?

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Who gets the jobs if you're
healthy and 120, and you've got

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.520 align:middle line:84%
a 30-year-old that's
starting a family?

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.620 align:middle line:84%
How do you even
begin to reconcile

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.320 align:middle line:84%
all of these knocked
on effects off--

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.069 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I have a
lot of faith in humans

00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and their ability to survive
to different things happening.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I think the world wide
web is the best example.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was introduced
and pushed on to all of us,

00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:34.619 align:middle line:90%
and we all adapted very quickly.

00:50:34.619 --> 00:50:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
going to be the same.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that, let's
say, 100 years from now, maybe

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.250 align:middle line:84%
200 years from now, we
have a cure for aging,

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and now the population
is suffering

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.956 align:middle line:84%
from all these problems
of overpopulation.

00:50:46.956 --> 00:50:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think a bigger problem
is, how would the young ever

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:52.180 align:middle line:84%
compete for jobs if the
old people never retire?

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's happening now.

00:50:53.595 --> 00:50:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well,
it's always happened.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:55.305 --> 00:50:58.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, but more so now.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: I think
that 200 years from now

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:05.299 align:middle line:84%
if all these problems
existed, and somebody said,

00:51:05.299 --> 00:51:06.840 align:middle line:84%
we should put
something on the ballot

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.972 align:middle line:84%
and vote on, should we ban
the cure for aging, nobody's

00:51:09.972 --> 00:51:12.180 align:middle line:84%
going to vote in favor of
banning the cure for aging.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:12.495 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:51:12.495 --> 00:51:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
think they are.

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:14.020 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they are,
but I want to throw in--

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: We'll find
some other solution.

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:19.509 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: We also need
to think about the fact

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:22.330 align:middle line:84%
that we will very likely
have the possibility

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:26.090 align:middle line:84%
to live virtually, and in
these virtual environments

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that we live, we won't use
up a lot of the resources.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean just a little
bit of electricity to--

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And I want to bring a
more esoteric aspect

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:40.700 align:middle line:84%
to the conversation,
and that is the majority

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.500 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, the various
religions of the planet,

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.230 align:middle line:84%
tend to embrace the whole
notion of reincarnation.

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you start taking
into consideration,

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:53.490 align:middle line:84%
say there is the karmic
wheel, and we come back,

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and we just learn, refine,
learn, refine, come back again.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Then does the length of the
lifespan of the physical body

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:03.980 align:middle line:90%
have the same import?

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Because you say so
much is lost when

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.610 align:middle line:84%
you die at the age of 80 of
experience and knowledge.

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSMAN: Right.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And this idea of immortality
means an eternal life,

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and eternity is a
really long time.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So if we go from living 80
years to living 300 years or 500

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:22.220 align:middle line:84%
years, that's still just a
drop in the bucket compared

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.530 align:middle line:90%
to eternity.

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So these other philosophical
and religious views,

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:33.660 align:middle line:84%
whether they're on
rebirths or reincarnation,

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.990 align:middle line:84%
you still have a lot
of time to deal with.

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, absolutely.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:40.069 align:middle line:84%
But you understand
the question is,

00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:45.210 align:middle line:84%
is a fear of no longer
existing, perhaps,

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:50.692 align:middle line:84%
one of the motivating factors
behind longevity research?

00:52:50.692 --> 00:52:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSMAN: Well, absolutely.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that people that
are involved in this

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.050 align:middle line:90%
would like to not have to die.

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a longevity clinic,
people come to my office,

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:04.474 align:middle line:84%
and when you go to a
doctor's office, they'll say,

00:53:04.474 --> 00:53:05.640 align:middle line:90%
what's your chief complaint?

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Why are you here?

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you how
many people have said,

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:09.840 align:middle line:90%
because I'm mortal.

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't want to die.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:14.230 align:middle line:84%
People are taking this
idea that immortality

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:15.272 align:middle line:90%
may be around the corner.

00:53:15.272 --> 00:53:16.646 align:middle line:84%
They're taking it
very seriously,

00:53:16.646 --> 00:53:18.090 align:middle line:90%
and they want it for themselves.

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
let's extend it out

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:24.730 align:middle line:84%
to those who say, OK, I may
die, but I'll be back, maybe

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:26.130 align:middle line:90%
as my own grandson.

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I'll be back, and I'll be
experiencing life again.

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some
knocked on memory

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.750 align:middle line:84%
that's contained within the
soul or the greater being

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:36.050 align:middle line:90%
that comes with that.

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:38.150 align:middle line:90%
More experience, new vehicle.

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.800 align:middle line:90%
So how does that part factor in?

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.265 align:middle line:84%
Would you say if a
person were embracing

00:53:44.265 --> 00:53:46.390 align:middle line:84%
the notion of reincarnation,
would it fit the same?

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: These are
not mutually exclusive.

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: Just because we can
live a longer period of time,

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:56.810 align:middle line:84%
whether it's 150 years or
500 years, nonetheless,

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:59.800 align:middle line:84%
if these other religious
concepts of reincarnation

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.710 align:middle line:84%
are true, you still
get to come back.

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:04.266 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop there.

00:54:04.266 --> 00:54:05.890 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be one or the other.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:07.170 align:middle line:90%
It could easily be both.

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that
is an argument,

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:10.148 align:middle line:84%
which is, hey, we're
going to come back anyway.

00:54:10.148 --> 00:54:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So what difference if
I last to be 120 or 80?

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.605 align:middle line:84%
There is that argument
from many people.

00:54:15.605 --> 00:54:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: What we are
is an accumulation of all

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.850 align:middle line:84%
of our memories and things we've
learned and things like that.

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we come back, we don't
bring those back with us.

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we're starting
from scratch again,

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:30.160 align:middle line:90%
so all that is still lost.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
agree with Terry.

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:34.780 align:middle line:90%
It's mutually exclusive.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.300 align:middle line:90%
We can still come back.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.360 align:middle line:84%
We can still die and
come back, but why not--

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead of 80, you
just get a couple hundred.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:41.886 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah.

00:54:41.886 --> 00:54:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's do 200 years from
now instead of 100.

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:46.001 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
is I don't look

00:54:46.001 --> 00:54:48.000 align:middle line:84%
at-- you had mentioned
when you first brought it

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.500 align:middle line:84%
up that there's a fear
of dying, essentially.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:52.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't look at it that way.

00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I just, I love living.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I would like to live
as long as I can.

00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.470 align:middle line:84%
As long as I'm enjoying it,
I want it to keep on going.

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.970 align:middle line:84%
If something happens to
me, and suddenly I've

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.660 align:middle line:84%
realized that the
rest of my life

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:08.010 align:middle line:84%
is going to be really
miserable and stuff like that,

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:12.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe the choice is to let
myself go and come back

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.446 align:middle line:90%
as somebody else.

00:55:13.446 --> 00:55:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Get a new body.

00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Start again.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Get to go through all the dating
and romance and hormones of 15

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.253 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:55:19.253 --> 00:55:21.015 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah.

00:55:21.015 --> 00:55:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whether that's
a good thing or bad thing.

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.950 align:middle line:84%
But it is an argument
about what fuels

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:29.430 align:middle line:84%
this search for longevity,
because you can't help but get

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:32.750 align:middle line:84%
religious and ethics and
philosophical issues involved

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:33.540 align:middle line:90%
in this subject.

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, I can tell
you that the-- I was really

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.890 align:middle line:84%
worried about what like
the Catholic Church

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:40.855 align:middle line:84%
thought about what we
were doing and stuff.

00:55:40.855 --> 00:55:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And one time I was
on an airplane,

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and there was a woman
that I sat next to,

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and she was in her whole nun
habit and stuff like that,

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:49.560 align:middle line:90%
outfit and stuff like that.

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So I just talked to
her, and it turned out

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:53.890 align:middle line:84%
she was a writer for
the Catholic Church.

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And she was
traveling, because she

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.620 align:middle line:84%
speaks at a lot of
different things.

00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And she ended up writing a
chapter in my first book saying

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:03.800 align:middle line:84%
that what we're doing
is the right thing.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.590 align:middle line:84%
It's part of it, as
she put it, God's will.

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:08.440 align:middle line:84%
God kicked us out of
the Garden of Eden,

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.710 align:middle line:84%
because we did some wrong
things, but God wants us back.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:13.390 align:middle line:84%
He wants us to
find our way back.

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:16.902 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is
regaining our immortality

00:56:16.902 --> 00:56:19.110 align:middle line:84%
like we had when we were
still in the Garden of Eden.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.740 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
couple minutes left,

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.620 align:middle line:84%
so how did you both feel about
the film "The Immortalist,"

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and what was the overarching
message of the film?

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREWS: Well, let me
say, my first thought was, I

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:37.170 align:middle line:84%
was terrified when I was
going to first see it.

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:40.530 align:middle line:84%
I saw it at the South by
Southwest Film Festival.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:44.560 align:middle line:84%
But I was blown
away at how gifted

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.070 align:middle line:84%
the directors are, and
the people that put

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:50.710 align:middle line:84%
that together-- the directors
and everybody else involved.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:53.540 align:middle line:84%
The music is just
unbelievably good.

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Forget about me and
Aubrey and Terry.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the way these guys
just took a lot of scenes,

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:01.860 align:middle line:84%
they spent four
years filming us,

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and then put all this
together into an absolutely

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:10.650 align:middle line:84%
fantastic, entertaining
account of the research.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there was a
really heart rending moment

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:16.280 align:middle line:84%
with one of the people that
was involved in the documentary

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:18.894 align:middle line:84%
that all of you had to contend
with when it comes to life.

00:57:18.894 --> 00:57:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Yeah.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.235 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was
actually three people.

00:57:21.235 --> 00:57:24.194 align:middle line:90%


00:57:24.194 --> 00:57:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
speaking of Randy.

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: OK.

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:26.600 align:middle line:90%
So Randy Lee.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.340 align:middle line:90%
He was very into this research.

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:31.360 align:middle line:84%
He's a friend of mine
from high school,

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and he came to work with me,
because he was very passionate

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:35.470 align:middle line:90%
about our research.

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And at the beginning of the
filming of this documentary,

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:42.170 align:middle line:84%
he had no idea, but later on,
he discovered he had cancer.

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And still during the
filming of this documentary,

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:47.150 align:middle line:90%
he passed away from his cancer.

00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But Leonard Hayflick's
mother died during the thing,

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:50.990 align:middle line:90%
and so did Aubrey's mother.

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So you're all dealing
with mortality

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.080 align:middle line:84%
up close and in your
face during this.

00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.080 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDREWS: And my father
is not doing well,

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.100 align:middle line:10%
and he believes that I'm
still going to come through

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:07.680 align:middle line:10%
with something to cure his
problems, and I'm hoping I can.

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a very fast race.

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is, indeed.

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GROSSMAN: And I
think that, you know,

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:18.830 align:middle line:84%
the main purpose of a
film is to entertain,

00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and I found the film
very entertaining.

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:23.140 align:middle line:10%
I enjoyed it a great deal.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:26.870 align:middle line:10%
I think that Jason and
David, the directors,

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:30.260 align:middle line:10%
did a fantastic job of that, and
I was enthralled to watch it.

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:31.817 align:middle line:90%
It really hooked me.

00:58:31.817 --> 00:58:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, we invite all of
our viewers to watch.

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:37.000 align:middle line:84%
If they haven't already
seen it, now they know you,

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.280 align:middle line:84%
so there's even more
incentive to take a watch.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.340 align:middle line:84%
So again, thank you
so much for your time

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and helping explain this
exciting new science

00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:45.290 align:middle line:90%
to all of us.

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDREWS: Thank you.

00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GROSSMAN: Thanks, so much.

00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:48.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can watch the
film, "The Immortalist," which

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:50.234 align:middle line:10%
features the lives
of a few researchers

00:58:50.234 --> 00:58:52.380 align:middle line:10%
in their personal
search for longevity

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.860 align:middle line:10%
here on Gaiam TV
under Documentaries.

00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
