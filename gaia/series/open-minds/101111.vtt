>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Every so often,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:10%
I encounter someone with
such a profound understanding

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:10%
of their subject
that it inspires.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Randall Carlson is
a 37-year Freemason

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
who has devoted his life
to the true understanding

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred effects of
geometry, geology, geomancy,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.700 align:middle line:90%
and several other disciplines.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
His knowledge has been
embedded in his work

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
as an architectural
designer and master builder.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
His goal is to revive lost
knowledge and human dignity

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:84%
toward the goal of
creating a new world based

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
on harmony, freedom,
and spiritual evolution.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So right off the top, I
said you're a Freemason.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:90%
So some people, oh, Freemason?

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Because there are so
many conspiracy theories

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:84%
about all of the
secret societies.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I wanted to
do is just set you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.210 align:middle line:84%
up first by talking about
your own life, what took you

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
into Freemasonry,
what it actually

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:84%
is compared to what conspiracy
theorists might believe

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
it is, and the implications,
because we hear

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.655 align:middle line:84%
things in weird rituals,
say, for example,

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:90%
with skull and bones.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RANDALL CARLSON: Sure.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just launch in
and tell us about yourself

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.219 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: Well, my
interest in Freemasonry

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:10%
goes back to the early
'70s when I really

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:10%
got into studying
ancient architecture

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.580 align:middle line:10%
and realized that there was
a body of encoded knowledge.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:10%
And we could find it in many
continents, most succinctly

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:10%
preserved, I think, in
European architecture,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:10%
and it was predominantly
in the Gothic cathedrals

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.020 align:middle line:10%
where we found it.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But it goes all the
way back to Egypt.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:90%
It goes back to Sumeria.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.220 align:middle line:90%
We find it in Southeast Asia.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.250 align:middle line:84%
We find in pre-Columbian
Mesoamerica.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.436 align:middle line:84%
And what we basically
find is that architecture

00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:90%
had a symbolical function.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:10%
And that's what very
much intrigued me,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.610 align:middle line:10%
was this idea that there
was information encoded

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.436 align:middle line:10%
in buildings, in
structures, in the design,

00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:10%
in their orientation
to the world

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:10%
and to the cosmos at large.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And so as I got into the idea
of symbolical architecture,

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I would encounter over and
over again the Freemasonic

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Order and the idea
that there had

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
been a tradition throughout
history of preserving knowledge

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and a methodology for
encoding this knowledge

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
into these great
works of architecture.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I had been studying this
stuff for about five years,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and then I just happened to
meet a couple of Freemasons.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.210 align:middle line:90%
One was writing a book.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
The other one was very much
of an esoteric Freemason.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And they sponsored me
into the fraternity.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.185 align:middle line:84%
So I was initiated
in 1978 and have been

00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:16.940 align:middle line:90%
an active Freemason since then.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I rose through the ranks
and became master of one

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:84%
of the largest lodges
in Georgia in 1999.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's a very
gratifying association.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:84%
But when I got into it all
of this conspiracy stuff

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:90%
didn't exist.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.030 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
come along with the internet.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.634 align:middle line:84%
And-- excuse me-- but I try to
point out that Freemasonry, now

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
that I've known hundreds
and hundreds of Freemasons,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
not one that I've
known has been involved

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:90%
in any kind of conspiracy.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's easy to
invoke conspiracy

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking about a,
quote unquote, "secret order."

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And really, there's not too much
that's secret about it anymore.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can go online,
and the whole ritual

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
is there for somebody
who wants to get into it.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even going
back to the 19th century

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
there were exposes where the
ritual had been published.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
that the secrecy goes back

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:84%
to the Middle Ages when
heretics were being crucified,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
when they were being
burned at the stake.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And basically, any
kind of an organization

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
that had the appearance
of being heretical

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:84%
could undergo
immense suppression.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a time--
there have been many times when

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Freemasonry has been outlawed.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
When Stalin took over in the
Soviet Union, it was outlawed.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
When Hitler took
over in Germany,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Freemasonry was outlawed.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
When Mao took over in
China, it was outlawed.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a long
history of suppression.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But what Freemasons are
really all about is, I think,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:84%
primarily two things-- doing
good works and preserving this

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.972 align:middle line:84%
corpus of symbolism that
we've inherited from--

00:05:10.972 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very ancient times.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: --the ancient
world, very ancient times, yes.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I think they've
just gotten a bad rap.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at American history,

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
yes, Freemasons were certainly
involved in the revolution,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't a Masonic
enterprise per se.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:84%
It was that a lot of the people
involved In it were, in fact,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Masons, but a lot
of them weren't.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the history
of Freemasony in this country,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that, I think, it was
14 of the American presidents

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:90%
have been Freemasons.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.987 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: The last
Masonic president,

00:05:45.987 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:90%
do you have any idea who it was?

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, who?

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.491 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Gerald Ford.

00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Gerald Ford.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: We have not
had a Masonic president

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:90%
since Gerald Ford.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.336 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
No, I should have known
that, but I didn't know that.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And prior to him was
Harry Truman, and prior to him

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.072 align:middle line:90%
was FDR.

00:05:59.072 --> 00:06:00.494 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: But I
like to point out

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
that 22 of the
American presidents

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:90%
have been Episcopalians.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.639 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to invoke
conspiracies and "puppet

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.805 align:middle line:84%
masters," it's clearly going
to be the Episcopalians

00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:12.482 align:middle line:90%
more so than the Freemasons.

00:06:12.482 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that is
interesting in and of itself.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think that you take us
down a whole different rabbit

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:90%
hole than where we're going.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: But I think
you get my point.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: So if we
look at recent history,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
we don't really see
too many Freemasons

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:90%
in positions of power.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.584 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why is that?

00:06:27.584 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: I think,
for one thing,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Freemasonry has
been-- its membership

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
has been on the decline
since its peak in the 1950s.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.857 align:middle line:84%
And at the time,
coming out of World War

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:44.820 align:middle line:84%
II, a lot of the individuals
who were in positions of power

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:90%
also happened to be Freemasons.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But then it's just as the
generations have turned over--

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I think my generation, not
nearly as high a percentage

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:84%
of individuals my age became
members of the fraternity

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:84%
as, say, my father's
and grandfather's age.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:90%
And things changed.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Before the advent of television
and all of the various things

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
that occupied us in the
post-World War II era,

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
there weren't a
whole lot of outlets

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:84%
for social
interactivity and so on.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it had
a lot of popularity

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.500 align:middle line:84%
simply for that reason,
if no other reason.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
like the Shriners,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Elks Lodge,
Oddfellows, there were

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.344 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different
groups at the time.

00:07:28.344 --> 00:07:30.884 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Now, the Shriners,
I should mention, actually they

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:90%
are all Freemasons.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is a
prerequisite to be

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.760 align:middle line:84%
a member in good standing
of the Masonic Fraternity

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:90%
in order to become a Shriner.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And they usually
referred to the Shrine

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:90%
as the playground of the Lodge.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually my
first exposure to the craft

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:84%
was that my grandfather used
to take me to the Shrine Circus

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.370 align:middle line:90%
as a little kid.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.996 align:middle line:10%
I had no idea--

00:07:52.996 --> 00:07:54.828 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's what
I remember as a kid is

00:07:54.828 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:10%
the Shriners and the parades and
giving money to the children's

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.524 align:middle line:10%
hospitals and so forth.

00:07:58.524 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And they raised
millions of dollars

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
for, like you just mentioned,
the children's hospitals,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.950 align:middle line:84%
the Scottish Rite Hospital for
crippled and burned children

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:90%
in New York-- Rite Hospital.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And they subsidized
for, I mean, orphanages

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.080 align:middle line:90%
all over the country.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they raised
huge amounts of money

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:90%
for charitable purposes.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.959 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, is one of
the most important functions

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:90%
that they do.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And the other function is
that they preserve this corpus

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge, as I mentioned.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's certainly, I
think, apparent that not

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
that many Freemasons
really understand

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.505 align:middle line:84%
the full depth of the symbolism
that they're entrusted with.

00:08:40.505 --> 00:08:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was going

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
because when you talk about
the notion of secrecy,

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
this goes back to the temples
from the most ancient times,

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:84%
where that knowledge
wasn't necessarily shared

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:90%
with the public at large.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:54.971 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Correct.

00:08:54.971 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was to be
used for high purpose

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:90%
with integrity at the time.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to say, as
with everything else in life,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:84%
there weren't corrupt forces
that also sprang out of it

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:84%
or had access to some
of the knowledge.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:90%
That's just the human condition.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But the intention
was to preserve

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.434 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that was sacred,
was sacred for a purpose.

00:09:16.434 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And there's no
question that an ambitious

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:84%
individual seeking to
gain advantage in society

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.610 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't or couldn't utilize
these kinds of venues to expand

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.334 align:middle line:90%
their network, to--

00:09:30.334 --> 00:09:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Expand their
power base, yeah.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.833 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: To expand
their power base, yeah.

00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And my suspicion is, from what
I know about Franklin Roosevelt,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.840 align:middle line:84%
that that was kind of his
motivation for getting

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.589 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:09:41.589 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, you have a lot

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
of individuals who are
just there primarily

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.450 align:middle line:90%
to do the charitable work.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I've seen
recently is that there

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a sort of
a revival of interest

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:84%
in the esoteric parts of
the craft, which I think is

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:90%
a very important development.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.935 align:middle line:84%
And recently, I'd say
within the last 10 years,

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
we've brought in a lot of
younger brothers in their 20s

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and 30s that are
very much interested

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.069 align:middle line:84%
in the meanings and the--
what is behind this symbolism?

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which it makes
sense because the desire

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
for this kind of
knowledge is kind

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.327 align:middle line:84%
of rising in general
through the public at large.

00:10:21.327 --> 00:10:23.535 align:middle line:84%
So of course, people are
going to find wherever there

00:10:23.535 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:84%
are saturated amounts
of that information,

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:90%
they'll be attracted to it.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.049 align:middle line:90%
So this is a good thing?

00:10:28.049 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes, I would say so.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And recently, I mean, with
the internet and with books

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:84%
like "The Da Vinci
Code" and things,

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.700 align:middle line:84%
it has helped to popularize and
bring to more popular attention

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.870 align:middle line:90%
the existence of the craft.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just they're an
easy target because they

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:84%
don't seek to engage in a
public debate or discourse.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they're an
easy target for those

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.120 align:middle line:84%
who want to start pulling
all kinds of strands together

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
to try to build this case for
conspiracy, or Illuminati,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.990 align:middle line:90%
Personally I don't buy it.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there
are conspiracies.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.355 align:middle line:84%
I just don't
believe that there's

00:11:09.355 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
a grand conspiracy where
there's one unified

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:90%
plan for global domination.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Because even amongst
the elites, there

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:84%
are differing,
conflicting agendas,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.454 align:middle line:90%
and that's just the reality.

00:11:20.454 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
important point

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:84%
because people in
general, I notice,

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:84%
are very comfortable
with assigning

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.500 align:middle line:84%
the full range of human
traits and desires and agendas

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:84%
to people at the middle to
lower socioeconomic range.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:84%
But not so much when you
go to the top of that range

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:90%
socioeconomically.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:84%
People start getting pasted
with just specific agendas, when

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.099 align:middle line:84%
it's as varied across the
board, whether you know how

00:11:48.099 --> 00:11:49.890 align:middle line:84%
to use power and money
and have it mastered

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:90%
or whether you're a pauper.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be the same
spectrum of human behavior

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:90%
for good and for worse.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would like
to see Freemasonry

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:84%
restored to a position
of respectability.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that
that's going to happen

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:84%
is just basically through
knowledge, people becoming

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:15.246 align:middle line:84%
informed, and not
taking this simple path

00:12:15.246 --> 00:12:19.310 align:middle line:84%
of-- because it is, it's a
very oversimplified model.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.894 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:19.894 --> 00:12:21.351 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And I
would always say--

00:12:21.351 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They with a
capital T. We've all done it.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.357 align:middle line:84%
Whoever "they" are,
whatever is obstructing

00:12:26.357 --> 00:12:28.190 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you
would like to see happen

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:90%
becomes part of "they."

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: "They."

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that undefined "they."

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And so part of, I think,
what went down here

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:84%
in terms of discrediting
is Skull and Bones

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:90%
and information that got out.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Then Bush, Baby
Bush, people thought

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.212 align:middle line:84%
how sophisticated could this
be if Baby Bush is in there?

00:12:51.212 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, right.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.336 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you got
Kerry and everybody else.

00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So talk about Skull and
Bones compared to the Masons.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: I'm not that
informed on Skull and Bones,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:84%
other than the fact that
they're a fraternity.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:90%
They're a Yale fraternity.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:84%
They have adopted
quasi-Masonic rituals.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.189 align:middle line:84%
But they have really no
affiliation with Freemasonry

00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
at all, other than the
fact that, yeah, I'm

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
sure that if you went
through and started plumbing

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.160 align:middle line:84%
the rolls of membership,
you could find here's

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:84%
some Skull and Bones members
that became Freemasons, right?

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But as organizations,
they basically

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:84%
have nothing to do
with each other.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.172 align:middle line:84%
They do have some parallels, I
think, in symbolism, I think--

00:13:34.172 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ritual.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: --because in all
of the rituals of the mystery

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:84%
traditions, they all
incorporate this idea of death

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:90%
and resurrection, right?

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.501 align:middle line:90%
They all do, see?

00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
an interesting topic.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Freddy
Silva, and his new book

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:84%
called "The Lost
Art of Resurrection"

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that talks about this
in some great depth.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's an absolutely
fascinating subject

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:84%
because it's not necessarily
what we think it is.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Right.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
what we think it is.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And my take on
that is essentially

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:84%
that it's a
recapitulation of what,

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
on an individual level, what
our species has undergone.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Our
species has undergone

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.230 align:middle line:84%
a death and resurrection,
maybe even more than once.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:24.539 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into that
discussion down the road here.

00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, so that's just
setting up who you are

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:90%
and why you became involved.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, you
then applied it

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:84%
through your
highly-developed skills

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.300 align:middle line:84%
as an architectural
designer and builder.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: To the extent
that I've been able to.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, is when you're
out there in the marketplace,

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.844 align:middle line:84%
you're very much having
to sell a project.

00:14:44.844 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And for me, I
consider it very fortuitous

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:84%
if I get somebody as
a client who says,

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let's incorporate
some sacred geometry.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's incorporate some
symbolism into this project.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:84%
More and more now, as
I'm getting out there

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and people are becoming
more aware of this,

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
that there is this possibility,
the interest is increasing.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hoping even
doing things like this,

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing right here,
to increase the interest

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to let people know that there
is kind of a revival of this,

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:84%
if you will, technology
or this methodology that

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:84%
has this long history going back
to the very dawn of our written

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we see that
architecture was

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:84%
a means of conveying
symbolical information

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:84%
from the very beginning
of our history.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.980 align:middle line:90%
But it also was more than that.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I think, it, in
effect, served almost

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:90%
as a sort of a technology.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
you're right on that.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: I mean, this gets
into the term you used earlier,

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:54.315 align:middle line:84%
geomancy, the idea that there
are forces in the planet,

00:15:54.315 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:84%
whether you want
to look at those

00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:00.400 align:middle line:84%
in terms of geomagnetic forces,
or telluric energies, whatever

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:90%
you want to call those.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.490 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that the
planet itself is

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:90%
suffused with an energy field.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
There's gravity forces, and
there's geomagnetic forces,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and these are subject to
all kinds of processes.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
main ones would

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.970 align:middle line:84%
be astronomical in
that our planet is

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.326 align:middle line:90%
part of a larger system.

00:16:22.326 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you look at it--
if you were to look at it,

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.670 align:middle line:84%
if you were to be able
to see it physically,

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:84%
whether it's on earth or
whether it's the cosmos,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
we're talking
about grid systems.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.284 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about grid systems.

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:35.830 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about-- the idea here

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:90%
is fractal self-similarity.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And in effect, you
mentioned earlier the quote

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that I like to use by
Protagoras, which is "Man

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:90%
is the measure of all things."

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
love that quote,

00:16:45.225 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to
really explain it to us.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well, the idea
is is that the geometry

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, the
geometry of the earth,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:84%
essentially is the
geometry of us.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And we are, each one of
us, a walking embodiment

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:90%
of sacred geometry.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:84%
And well, we can give
some simple examples.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.470 align:middle line:84%
If we take the
traditional cubit, which

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:84%
comes from the Latin
cubitus which means forearm,

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.109 align:middle line:84%
right, it was the distance
from elbow to fingertip, right?

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think at this
stage of the game,

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
everybody's heard of the golden
section, the divine proportion,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, in mathematical
terms, it's simply the idea

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:84%
that if you have-- we'll
start with the simplest, which

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:90%
is a line.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And we can divide that
line in such a way

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:84%
that we create two
asymmetrical lengths.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:90%
We divide it down the middle.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:84%
They're both equal, and that's
a static division, right?

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we move off that middle,
we've created an asymmetry,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.170 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.753 align:middle line:84%
And there's going
to be a relationship

00:17:45.753 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
between the small part
and the large part.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's one place where
we can make that division such

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that the relation of the
small part to the large part

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same
as the relation

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.040 align:middle line:90%
of the large part to the total.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:90%
That's the golden section.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then it goes
back into its symmetry.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.665 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the human anatomy,
if we take the cubit, elbow

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
to fingertip, that distance--
if you feel right now,

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Regina, on your wrist,
feel your finger up there.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel around,
there will be a little space.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
That space is called
the space of Destot.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.420 align:middle line:84%
That right there
in your wrist joint

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:84%
divides your cubit in that
golden section relationship.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.780 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's the ratio?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: The ratio
in numerical terms

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.809 align:middle line:90%
is 1.618 rounded off.

00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So the standard
golden-- yes, ratio.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:35.928 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Right.

00:18:35.928 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:90%
1.61803.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.675 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that is a
living example of that ratio.

00:18:39.675 --> 00:18:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.466 align:middle line:90%
But that's just one example.

00:18:41.466 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at your
fingers-- take your fingertip,

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:90%
look at this.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:84%
The first digit from
tip to first knuckle,

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.900 align:middle line:84%
then from first knuckle
to second knuckle,

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.397 align:middle line:84%
is exactly that
same relationship.

00:18:53.397 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.771 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: If you're
standing up and you're

00:18:55.771 --> 00:18:58.200 align:middle line:84%
letting your arms hang
loosely at your sides

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.520 align:middle line:84%
where your fingertips touch
your thighs, that divides

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:84%
your whole height so that
the large part is on top,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.422 align:middle line:90%
the small is on the bottom.

00:19:07.422 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you take
your whole height,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.671 align:middle line:84%
and you measure from
the floor to your head

00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and divide it by
this golden section,

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:84%
and you put the small
section at the top,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:84%
then that division
defines your navel center.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.750 align:middle line:90%
And it goes.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:22.162 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's in the
structure of the face.

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, there's dozens
and dozens of different ways

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that that particular ratio
manifests in the human anatomy.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But we find it expressed
throughout all life forms

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
in some form or another.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.514 align:middle line:84%
And here's what's
interesting, is

00:19:35.514 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that it seems that the more
evolved the life form, the more

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:90%
saliently that ratio appears.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So you can find it in
a horse, but it's not

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:84%
found as much as you find
it in the human anatomy.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:84%
You can find it in
flowers and in plants.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.970 align:middle line:84%
It's also found in certain
mathematical sequences, one

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:90%
being the Fibonacci--

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.336 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fibonacci
sequence, yes.

00:19:59.336 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: --where each
number in that sequence

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.690 align:middle line:10%
is the sum of the
two that came before.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:10%
And in effect, geometrically
it's the same thing,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:10%
as we're saying that
here's this total length,

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.790 align:middle line:10%
and it's the sum of
this and this, see?

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:16.612 align:middle line:10%
And when you take the numbers
of the Fibonacci sequence--

00:20:16.612 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:10%
it would start out 1, 1, 2, 3,
5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, and each
one of those numbers

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:10%
is the sum of the
two proceeding.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:10%
And if you take them as a
ratio of each successive pair,

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:10%
5 over 3, 8 over 5, 13
over 8, what you then see

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:10%
is you take the decimal value
of that ratio, and as a limit

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:10%
it approaches the
golden section.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:90%
But it never gets there exactly.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
It just keeps getting
closer and closer and closer

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.370 align:middle line:90%
the bigger your numbers are.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:57.007 align:middle line:84%
So 144 over 89 is going to be
closer than say 55 over 34.

00:20:57.007 --> 00:20:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And as you keep going
through that sequence,

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
closer and closer,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.578 align:middle line:84%
but you'll never
actually get there

00:21:01.578 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:84%
until you're out
somewhere in infinity.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:90%
And at that point, it converges.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
"Asymptotically" is
the term that you

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.669 align:middle line:90%
would use mathematically.

00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So what's arising in my
mind is, on one level,

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
the nature of life on
this planet in the cosmos

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:90%
in this sense is asymmetrical.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: It has to be.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet the
Platonic solids,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and for the most part in what
we find ourselves resonating

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:84%
with for our own
comfort, sometimes even

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:40.530 align:middle line:84%
for our own
orientation, maybe even

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:84%
to drop away from a sense
of chaos, is symmetry.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.445 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Symmetry.

00:21:45.445 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the interface

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:84%
between the essential
asymmetry building--

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the asymmetrical
building blocks of life

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:90%
and the need for such symmetry.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: The problem--
perfect symmetry is static.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: You have to
have some asymmetry.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.935 align:middle line:90%
Asymmetry is dynamic.

00:22:03.935 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, right.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: That's what
sets things into motion.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the tension that occurs
between the asymmetrical parts

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.390 align:middle line:90%
of a system.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you've got
this perfect symmetry,

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.747 align:middle line:84%
then things fall into balance
and they become static.

00:22:18.747 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:90%
There's no further--

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.038 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
true, and it seems

00:22:21.038 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:90%
that we're often seeking that.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you have,
say, a person's face

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
that is terribly
asymmetrical, things are not

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.080 align:middle line:84%
in a normal proportion,
for example,

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.610 align:middle line:90%
you can't reconcile yourself.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
even orient yourself

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
toward another person
just because something

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:90%
might be asymmetrical.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: But on
the other hand,

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.882 align:middle line:84%
if you saw a face that
was perfectly symmetrical,

00:22:42.882 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't look right.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.173 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You wouldn't see them.

00:22:45.173 --> 00:22:46.288 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't see them.

00:22:46.288 --> 00:22:48.496 align:middle line:90%
It'd be background noise.

00:22:48.496 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Nobody has a
perfectly symmetrical face.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Everybody's-- things
are a little different from one

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:90%
side to the other.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:02.135 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think, part of the
dynamism of organic existence.

00:23:02.135 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.218 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was just
reflecting on it

00:23:04.218 --> 00:23:07.110 align:middle line:84%
because of such beautiful
symmetry in the Platonic solids

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and the various forms
of geometry that

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:90%
are used to create structure.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Right.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:17.871 align:middle line:90%
And I wish I had my models here.

00:23:17.871 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:90%
I oftentimes work with models.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.610 align:middle line:90%
You don't have your toys here.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: I don't
have my toys, no.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm grasping for invisible toys.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.922 align:middle line:84%
But the set of five
Platonic solids,

00:23:28.922 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:84%
they actually have a
nesting relationship

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that is embodied in
the golden section.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So that you can start out
with the simplest ones-- well,

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
if you start out
with an icosahedron,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and then you expand
it in a certain way--

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.772 align:middle line:84%
and it's difficult to
explain-- but it grows

00:23:47.772 --> 00:23:51.730 align:middle line:84%
by an additive and a geometric
process simultaneously,

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
which is based upon
the golden section.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:59.200 align:middle line:10%
And the dodecahedron to me,
which is the most beautiful

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.879 align:middle line:10%
of the Platonic solids, is 12--

00:24:00.879 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: 12, yeah.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: --pentagonal faces.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, the pentagon is like
the pure geometric embodiment

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:10%
of the golden section.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a pentagon
with five sides, right,

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and you connect alternate
vertices, you get a pentagram.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.455 align:middle line:84%
The relationship of one
side of the pentagram--

00:24:17.455 --> 00:24:21.350 align:middle line:84%
it's a five-pointed star--
to one side of the pentagon

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:24.800 align:middle line:84%
is the perfect golden
section relationship, see?

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally,
the five has always

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
been the numerical
representative

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:90%
of the human domain.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:84%
We have our five fingers,
our five appendages, our five

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:90%
senses.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we're based
upon the golden section, which

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.140 align:middle line:84%
is derived from the relationship
between-- it's actually

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:48.030 align:middle line:84%
the square root of
5 plus 1 cut in 1/2.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:84%
The square root of 5
plus 1 divided by 2

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:90%
gives you the golden section.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the golden
section is derived

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.970 align:middle line:84%
not from two, or three
or four, but from five.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:59.609 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:59.609 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:90%
So I have a quick question, OK?

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.312 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: OK.

00:25:03.312 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just from
architecture, and just

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:84%
for a moment here
before we start

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.990 align:middle line:84%
moving on to what these
sacred numbers have meant

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and how we've
misinterpreted them.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So for right now,
from what we've just

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:84%
talked about about
form, geometry,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.719 align:middle line:84%
these ratios such as the golden
ratio, what is the most--

00:25:25.719 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and I know everybody's
different-- but what

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:32.494 align:middle line:84%
would be an ideal structure
for a human being to live in?

00:25:32.494 --> 00:25:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well, this
has been, I think,

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.980 align:middle line:84%
one of the goals of
architects for generations

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:90%
and generations.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
going to be found

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.620 align:middle line:90%
in modernist architecture--

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I don't think so.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a little
bit of a loaded question,

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:45.436 align:middle line:90%
but I'm curious.

00:25:45.436 --> 00:25:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: --or brutalist.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:52.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, the architect Le
Corbusier developed a system

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:10%
that he called a modular
that was essentially

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.610 align:middle line:10%
based on the height
of a 6-foot man,

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:10%
and then derivative from that
were all of the golden section

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:10%
relationships.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.540 align:middle line:84%
That might be one place to
start, one place to experiment.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I think when you look
at temple architecture

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
throughout history,
what you're trying

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to do is-- I used
the term earlier,

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:90%
"fractal self-similarity."

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Or another term that kind of
applies to the same concept

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:90%
is scale invariance.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:84%
The idea here is that
the temple serves

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:29.980 align:middle line:84%
as a mean between two domains,
the human domain and the larger

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:84%
domain of the landscape and
ultimately the planet itself.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that-- like
the brutalist architecture,

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.665 align:middle line:84%
the architectures they had
in fascist Germany was very--

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: --monumental.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so horrible.

00:26:43.815 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And it was not at all
derived from the human scale.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
It was meant to
overpower and intimidate.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:84%
That was the psychological
objective of it.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, on the other hand,
I think like if you

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.750 align:middle line:10%
take the work of somebody like
Christopher Alexander, who

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.110 align:middle line:10%
has developed a whole
pattern language based

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:10%
upon a whole sort of an organic
architecture derived ultimately

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:10%
from the human scale.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:10%
And this was sort of pioneered
by Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.745 align:middle line:10%
And he was the one
who developed the term

00:27:13.745 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:10%
of "organic
architecture," the idea

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:10%
that the scale of the
structure should somehow

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:10%
relate to the human scale.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And whether he deliberately
incorporated dynamic symmetry

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and sacred geometry
into his architecture,

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:90%
he probably didn't.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.630 align:middle line:10%
But he had such an
intuitive sense about it

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:38.194 align:middle line:10%
that it's there in many
examples of his buildings.

00:27:38.194 --> 00:27:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's what we're

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to do here is
that the building serve

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.957 align:middle line:84%
as a medium between the human
scale and the larger scale.

00:27:48.957 --> 00:27:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're a sensitive
being, a human being,

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:90%
you can feel.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example, I was in
an apartment that was very,

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.930 align:middle line:84%
to me, brutal, just
cold, right angles

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:07.710 align:middle line:84%
with the very trendy lofty thing
with your big ducting, aluminum

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.110 align:middle line:84%
pipes running
across the ceiling.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Very industrial.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Industrial
markings on the ceiling

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that the workers
intentionally didn't cover up

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:90%
when they left or were raised.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling on
the mind was horrible.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Where in my home,
for example, there

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.350 align:middle line:84%
are very few right
angles and lots

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:90%
of archways, loads of archways.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.040 align:middle line:90%
Even windows are arched.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And there, people
walk in and say--

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I had this one kid
who was 16 years old

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.520 align:middle line:84%
one time was just
kind of loping along.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And he came into the
house, and he stopped cold

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and he goes, dude, you
can breathe in here.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion
of breath and movement

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.611 align:middle line:84%
in these circular spaces,
like Steiner's Goetheanum,

00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:90%
the original Goetheanum.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Yes,
there's a good example.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:50.747 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:28:50.747 --> 00:28:52.538 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: Well, I'm
not an expert on that,

00:28:52.538 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:10%
other than the fact that I'm
sure that he was attempting

00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:10%
to embody that principle, the
principle that the building

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.690 align:middle line:10%
itself incorporated
organic form and then

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:10%
served as that mean that
allowed humans to access

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.340 align:middle line:10%
a higher level of things.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is what we find
in all sacred architecture

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.670 align:middle line:84%
throughout history from all
over the world, this idea

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that there is a pattern
there, and that pattern

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.436 align:middle line:84%
is reflective of some
higher order of things.

00:29:21.436 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.860 align:middle line:84%
You could say the
cosmic egg, in a sense,

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and his interlocking
domes are a beehive,

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.770 align:middle line:84%
which is also symbolic in a lot
of these ancient traditions.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:29.395 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:29:29.395 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, the beehive is a
very prominent Masonic symbol--

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: --which you find--

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:33.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's
why I brought It up.

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.140 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But we see that
there is a pattern.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, for most of the
time if not all of the time,

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.285 align:middle line:84%
that pattern is a reflection
of the higher cosmic patterns.

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:50.910 align:middle line:90%
So Sedona is a good example.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.230 align:middle line:10%
If you go just to
the east of Sedona,

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:10%
you're in the Chacoan territory,
which covered the whole San

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:10%
Juan Basin.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Chacoan people had
a civilization or a culture

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:08.070 align:middle line:84%
based upon a cosmic pattern
whose center, whose locus,

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:90%
was Chaco Canyon itself.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But outlying from
Chaco Canyon are

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:20.780 align:middle line:84%
all of the temples, the
signal towers, various effigy

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.830 align:middle line:90%
locations, sites of pilgrimage.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what's interesting
that if you actually

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:84%
trace the pathways of
this pattern, which

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:36.670 align:middle line:84%
covers at least 10,000 square
miles, what you're effectively

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:84%
doing is translating
a cosmic pattern

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.460 align:middle line:90%
onto the surface of the Earth.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
doing a pilgrimage

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.360 align:middle line:84%
from Chaco Canyon to some
of the outlying areas,

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.810 align:middle line:84%
there's a very interesting--
not too far from here,

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.047 align:middle line:84%
near Durango is a place
called Chimney Rock.

00:30:53.047 --> 00:30:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard of it?

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.671 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've heard
of Chimney Rock.

00:30:55.671 --> 00:30:56.990 align:middle line:90%
I've never been there, though.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: It's worth going to.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a celestial
observatory that was

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:90%
part of this Chacoan system.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you go along
these pathways

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:11.020 align:middle line:84%
that link these various sacred
centers in this Chacoan system,

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.500 align:middle line:84%
what you're in effect doing
is you're tracing on Earth

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.310 align:middle line:84%
the pathways of the sun
and the moon and key

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.600 align:middle line:84%
stars as they would translate
to the Earth itself.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So in some cases, you might
be following a pathway,

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and where that
pathway intersects

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.130 align:middle line:84%
the line of the horizon
might be the exact position

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.150 align:middle line:84%
on the horizon
where the moon will

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:36.070 align:middle line:84%
set in its maximum northerly
limit every 18.61 years.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you know that
time and you're

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:42.040 align:middle line:84%
making that journey,
that pilgrimage,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.940 align:middle line:84%
you're essentially
following the moon.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you're siting the
distant horizon, which

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.630 align:middle line:84%
is the objective
of your pilgrimage,

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.610 align:middle line:84%
the moon is either going
to be rising or setting

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:55.039 align:middle line:90%
at that position.

00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's only going to
be at that position,

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:00.460 align:middle line:84%
say, once every 18.6 years,
and that is quite remarkable

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's very
similar to what we find

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.930 align:middle line:90%
all over the ancient world.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:08.880 align:middle line:10%
The Gothic cathedrals that
were dedicated to Notre Dame

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.190 align:middle line:10%
create an effigy on the
landscape of northern France

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:16.910 align:middle line:10%
of the constellation of Virgo,
which is interesting and hardly

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.870 align:middle line:10%
coincidental that those very
cathedrals were dedicated

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:10%
to the Virgin.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:22.156 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:22.156 --> 00:32:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And so here you
have a star map translated

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.100 align:middle line:90%
onto the landscape of France.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.741 align:middle line:84%
I think that Scott Onstott has
talked about that, I believe.

00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:30.324 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:30.324 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:90%
We talked about that.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Scott has gone really far into
deciphering these patterns.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, he's
doing really good work.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:38.616 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah.

00:32:38.616 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:90%
It's good stuff.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's easier for the skeptic,
the reductionist thinker,

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.410 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh, you're just
playing with numbers.

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But what the
Pythagoreans understood

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.589 align:middle line:84%
was that God played
with numbers.

00:32:51.589 --> 00:32:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So now we get to the heart
of this conversation.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:59.850 align:middle line:84%
As I was going
through your work--

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:84%
we're going to just
talk about, say,

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:03.970 align:middle line:84%
three numbers, the
most common ones people

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:05.560 align:middle line:90%
will have heard about.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But let's go first to the number
9 because the number of thing--

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.180 align:middle line:84%
here, I have copious notes--
the number of things that

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:84%
reduce to the number 9 and the
numerological value of what

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:84%
number 9 means is
really shocking when

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:24.980 align:middle line:90%
people start looking into it.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So I would like you
to share with us all

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.950 align:middle line:84%
of the different numerics that
reduce to 9 on this planet

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:34.146 align:middle line:84%
and in the cosmos and
in time and in space.

00:33:34.146 --> 00:33:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Oh, my goodness.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, kabbalistically, the
number 9 symbolizes completion.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:43.050 align:middle line:84%
It's completion of the
decad before we start

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:46.140 align:middle line:90%
a new cycle on a higher level.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Now we're at 10.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But so counting the
numbers 1 through 9, right?

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And the sacred alphabets were
based on this denary system,

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:84%
where the Hebrew alphabet, for
example, started with aleph,

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and when you got to
yud, it was 10, right?

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But then each letter would
represent a numerical value,

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.510 align:middle line:90%
as did the Greek alphabet.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:13.230 align:middle line:84%
See this is pre-Arabic numeral
system, Hindu-Arabic numeral

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:16.330 align:middle line:84%
system, where now we've got one
set of symbols for our numbers

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.239 align:middle line:84%
and one set of symbols
for our alphabet.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
one and the same.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:19.719 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: One and the same.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had
the same value.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.347 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: They had
the same value, yeah.

00:34:22.347 --> 00:34:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So an aleph was 1, a bet was
2, gimel was 3, dalet was 4.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And classic
numerology even now recognized

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.464 align:middle line:84%
that every letter
has a numeric effect.

00:34:32.464 --> 00:34:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think probably modern
numerology derives ultimately

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.880 align:middle line:90%
from these ancient systems.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.780 align:middle line:84%
But they were basically on
units, tens, and hundreds, see?

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, 9 in that was sort of the
completion of the first decad.

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So it had this symbolism
of completion, right?

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But like you just said, so
many of these sacred numbers,

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:84%
if you reduce them
kabbalistically, you

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:03.930 align:middle line:84%
take this single digit-- let's
take the number of, let's say,

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.990 align:middle line:84%
we could take the number
of miles in the moon.

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.984 align:middle line:90%
2,160 miles measures the moon.

00:35:08.984 --> 00:35:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, we only get this
number, of course,

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:15.060 align:middle line:84%
if we use miles, not kilometers
or anything else, miles.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:20.682 align:middle line:84%
Now, 2,160, if we add 2 and
1 and 6, of course, we get 9.

00:35:20.682 --> 00:35:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reduces to 9.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.348 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Right?

00:35:22.348 --> 00:35:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the
so-called Great Year,

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.020 align:middle line:84%
the model of this
great cycle that

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
was recognized by many
of the ancient cultures,

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.795 align:middle line:84%
which is actually a real
astronomical phenomenon.

00:35:32.795 --> 00:35:34.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the precession
of the equinoxes.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The equinoxes, yes.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:35.735 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:35:35.735 --> 00:35:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And so the Earth's
axis is swinging around

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:84%
like this at 50
arcseconds per year.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.190 align:middle line:84%
That means that if
you think of a degree,

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:50.260 align:middle line:90%
a degree is 60 minutes, right?

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Each minute is 60 seconds.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So 50 arcseconds is
just a little less

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.910 align:middle line:90%
than a minute of arc.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.490 align:middle line:84%
What does that translate into
in something that we can grasp?

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking
at the full moon,

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that 2,160-mile
diameter full moon, it,

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.140 align:middle line:84%
to use the mathematical
term, subtends,

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.710 align:middle line:90%
or covers one half of a degree.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you had two full
moons tangent to each other

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:90%
in the sky, that's one degree.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.210 align:middle line:84%
If we had 720 of
them, like strung

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:25.080 align:middle line:84%
on a string of beads that
would encompass the Earth,

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:90%
each pair would be one degree.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:28.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at
the system itself

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:84%
of dividing a circle, 360
degrees times 60 times

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:38.529 align:middle line:90%
60, all of those--

00:36:38.529 --> 00:36:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It all keeps
reducing it back out to 9.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: They all
come reducing back to 9.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:49.700 align:middle line:84%
In one full circle, if we take
just the number of seconds,

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.085 align:middle line:84%
right, seconds of arc,
which are extremely tiny

00:36:52.085 --> 00:36:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and have no practical daily use,
but are important, for example,

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:01.230 align:middle line:84%
if you're trying to measure
the proper motion of a star,

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:05.690 align:middle line:84%
a distant star, against the
backdrop of a galaxy, where

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:09.310 align:middle line:84%
it's so small you need
these really refined numbers

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.240 align:middle line:90%
to do it, right?

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So astronomers will
use arcseconds.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:18.726 align:middle line:84%
But in a full circle,
there's 1,296,000, 1,296,000.

00:37:18.726 --> 00:37:21.520 align:middle line:84%
You add those up, and you're
ultimately going to get 9.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 9.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.686 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah.

00:37:22.686 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all the
geometrical structures.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.265 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
really interesting.

00:37:27.265 --> 00:37:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: The Platonic solids.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, right.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't matter if
it's tetrahedron, octahedron,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.505 align:middle line:84%
icosahedron, dodecahedron,
star tetrahedron--

00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --keeps coming back.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:90%
It all comes back to 9.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Comes back to 9.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I think,
again, we're looking

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:51.740 align:middle line:84%
at our number systems
are expressive of this--

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.930 align:middle line:84%
ultimately if you want to
think of it as designed,

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:55.690 align:middle line:90%
this cosmic design.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, there's this
underlying template of reality.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's expressed
in the architecture

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of the solar system, in the
architecture of a galaxy,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.820 align:middle line:90%
of a spiral galaxy.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.180 align:middle line:84%
It's expressed in
the number systems

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.650 align:middle line:84%
because the number systems
we have evolved essentially

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:17.710 align:middle line:90%
come from us.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:84%
A denary system is
based upon the fact

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.370 align:middle line:90%
that there's 5 and 5 is 10.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, you see, if you
combine the 10 with the 6

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.670 align:middle line:84%
is where we come up
with what's referred

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to as the sexigesimal
system, which

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.690 align:middle line:84%
is the division of
a circle into 360.

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I think mathematical
historians have suggested

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:40.300 align:middle line:84%
that the Sumerians are the
first ones in history who

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.730 align:middle line:84%
are recognized to have
used a sexigesimal system.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is believed that they
did so because they believed

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:52.660 align:middle line:84%
that, once upon a time,
the length of the year

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.859 align:middle line:90%
was exactly 360 days.

00:38:54.859 --> 00:38:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was going to get to next.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about cycles
of time and how 9 factors

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:02.260 align:middle line:90%
in repeatedly.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well, when we look
at the full precessional cycle,

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.140 align:middle line:84%
right now, it's
measured-- it's slightly

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:84%
more than 50
arcseconds per year.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if
that is necessarily

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:84%
going to hold exactly steady
throughout the whole cycle,

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.340 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:16.630 align:middle line:90%
It's just that--

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just what
it's doing now.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: It's
what it's doing now.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's
likely that that's not

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.050 align:middle line:84%
going to be constant
throughout the whole system.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But the traditional number
associated with the Great Year

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:31.220 align:middle line:90%
is 25,920 years.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.400 align:middle line:84%
If you open an
astronomy textbook,

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.380 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes it'll round
it off to 26,000, right,

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and they figure
that's close enough.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Certainly 25,920
is actually closer

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.040 align:middle line:84%
to what the real number
would be if it was slightly

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.970 align:middle line:90%
more than 50 arcseconds.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you do assume it
rounded off at 50 arcseconds,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.810 align:middle line:84%
then it works out to be
one degree every 72 years,

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, which is interesting
because that's very, very close

00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:59.830 align:middle line:90%
to an average human lifespan.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, one degree, if you
think of the Great Year

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:05.690 align:middle line:84%
model, this circle, and it's
the vernal equinox moving

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.250 align:middle line:84%
through each of the
12 constellations,

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:12.950 align:middle line:84%
each of those 12 constellations
has a sign associated with it.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.830 align:middle line:84%
The constellation gave
its name to the sign.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, the constellations
themselves

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:20.870 align:middle line:90%
vary in size considerably.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:10%
But the signs that
bear those same names,

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:10%
they have been idealized at
exactly 1/12 of the circle.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it bears the same
relation as the 12 months

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.050 align:middle line:84%
due to the annual
year, the solar year,

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:37.560 align:middle line:90%
the 12 hours on the clock face.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got the 12
months of the Great Year.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you take
1/12 of that 25,920,

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.260 align:middle line:84%
it's 2,160 years,
which is interesting

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.560 align:middle line:84%
because now we just said
that the moon measures

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.850 align:middle line:90%
in miles in 2,160 miles.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:84%
But the month of the Great
Year-- and the word "month"

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:03.550 align:middle line:84%
essentially comes from the word
"moon," right, is 2,160 years.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the same number
in one hand measuring

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.300 align:middle line:84%
a spatial relationship,
on the other hand,

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:90%
a temporal relationship.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:16.642 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: So time and space
linked by this common number.

00:41:16.642 --> 00:41:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Of course, then the
skeptic says, yeah,

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.720 align:middle line:84%
but that's only if
you measure in miles.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.330 align:middle line:84%
But then I point
out, but again, see,

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:29.410 align:middle line:84%
the mile is derived from the
human yardstick because a mile,

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:84%
the word itself mile
comes from the Latin mil,

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.880 align:middle line:90%
which means 1,000.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And a mile has always
been traditionally

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.900 align:middle line:90%
1,000 human paces.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
wondered about that.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.495 align:middle line:84%
But a pace is actually
not one step, but two.

00:41:41.495 --> 00:41:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Two.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.328 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's the completed.

00:41:43.328 --> 00:41:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So people get tripped up when
they hear that the first time.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.090 align:middle line:90%
I thought, no, that's not right.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.107 align:middle line:84%
A normal pace is only
about 2, 2 and 1/2 feet.

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought,
oh, wait a minute.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a full pace.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.805 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:41:54.805 --> 00:41:56.992 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to try
to mark off 1,000 paces,

00:41:56.992 --> 00:41:58.450 align:middle line:84%
what's going to be
easier, counting

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.579 align:middle line:90%
every step, or every time--

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One, two,

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: --saying your
right foot hits the ground?

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, yeah.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I just wanted
to clarify that for someone

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.161 align:middle line:90%
listening saying, uh-uh.

00:42:06.161 --> 00:42:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And the ratio between
the average human pace

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and the length of the
average human foot is 5.28.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.847 align:middle line:84%
And so 1,000 of those
gives us the 5,280 feet--

00:42:19.847 --> 00:42:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's organic.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:21.971 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: --of the mile.

00:42:21.971 --> 00:42:23.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's very organic, yes.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on that
ratio between-- and see,

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.760 align:middle line:84%
that was considered to
be a very special ratio.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.510 align:middle line:84%
See, it's our feet that
anchors to the Earth, isn't it?

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It's our pace that moves us
about the face of the Earth,

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:38.830 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the Book of
Revelation, the climactic book

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.680 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible, St.
John the Divine

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.610 align:middle line:84%
is given this vision of the
Holy City descending out

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:54.660 align:middle line:84%
of heaven, right, and he
describes it as a cube.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:84%
"And the city
lieth foursquare--"

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.245 align:middle line:84%
and the length and the
height and the breadth of it

00:42:58.245 --> 00:43:01.960 align:middle line:84%
are equal, 12,000
furlongs, right?

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.180 align:middle line:90%
What is a furlong?

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, anybody out
there who likes

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.600 align:middle line:84%
to bet on the races, horse
races, knows what a furlong is.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.880 align:middle line:84%
It's one eighth of a
mile, or 660 feet, right?

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, the mean
diameter of the Earth

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:20.720 align:middle line:90%
is very close to 7,920 miles.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Earth varies because
it's really an oblate spheroid.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.960 align:middle line:84%
It spins on its axis, and
because it's plastic somewhat,

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.455 align:middle line:90%
it bulges towards the equator.

00:43:29.455 --> 00:43:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
got a belly bulge.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:32.098 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Got a belly bulge.

00:43:32.098 --> 00:43:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, it does
because that belly bulge

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.570 align:middle line:90%
keeps it stable.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Without that, it's going
to be rocking chaotically.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:43.164 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:43.164 --> 00:43:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: And probably
the highest life

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.090 align:middle line:84%
form on Earth would be
something very, very primitive.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, an amoeba.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.471 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Yeah,
an amoeba, exactly.

00:43:49.471 --> 00:43:49.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But now if you take
an idealized sphere

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to represent the Earth that
would have the same surface

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:00.060 align:middle line:84%
area and volume
as the Earth, it's

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:04.520 align:middle line:84%
basically a sphere
7,920 miles in diameter.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's somewhat more than
the mean diameter of the Earth,

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:84%
but it's been frequently
used as-- oftentimes,

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.350 align:middle line:84%
you even see it rounded
off to 8,000 miles.

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:18.910 align:middle line:90%
But 7,920 miles is close enough.

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the
diameter of the Earth

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:24.182 align:middle line:84%
if you drew a diameter, say,
from the Tropic of Cancer

00:44:24.182 --> 00:44:26.390 align:middle line:84%
in the Northern Hemisphere
to the Tropic of Capricorn

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:29.240 align:middle line:90%
in the Southern, 7,920 miles.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, think
about 7 plus 9 plus 2

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.810 align:middle line:90%
is 18, it gives us a 9, right.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:39.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go back to
the furlong that we find.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:84%
The furlong is derived
from-- the original writing

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:84%
of it was in Greek, and the
word was stade, from which

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.090 align:middle line:90%
we get the word stadium.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it was the
length of the footrace,

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.170 align:middle line:90%
or the race around the stadium.

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.670 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:59.090 align:middle line:90%
That's where we get the stade.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:02.490 align:middle line:84%
The English counterpart to the
Greek stade was the furlong,

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's one eighth of the
English mile, or 660 feet.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you take the
ratio of the furlong

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.060 align:middle line:84%
to the inch, which is
derived from the width

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:18.620 align:middle line:90%
of the human thumb, it's 7,920.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So that furlong--
and I've done this.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I've gone out with a long
fiberglass tape on a parking

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.700 align:middle line:90%
lot and marked out a furlong.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And then if you sit there
and you put your thumb down,

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.300 align:middle line:84%
your thumb to that furlong
is exactly the same

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.350 align:middle line:90%
as a mile to the Earth.

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you're
diligent, yeah.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.680 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.305 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why
you're able to bring

00:45:38.305 --> 00:45:41.054 align:middle line:84%
such extraordinary correlations
between these numbers.

00:45:41.054 --> 00:45:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.904 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've tutored
lots of kids in math,

00:45:43.904 --> 00:45:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of the things
that I always have fun doing.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:46.424 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:46.424 --> 00:45:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I wish you'd been
my math teacher.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.688 align:middle line:90%
I slept through most of that.

00:45:48.688 --> 00:45:50.907 align:middle line:90%


00:45:50.907 --> 00:45:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: OK.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's take the next step.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.160 align:middle line:90%
We go to 12,000 furlongs.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you take
12,000 furlongs

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and convert that to feet, 12,000
times 660 is 7,920,000 feet,

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.520 align:middle line:84%
or the diameter of
the Earth raised

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.790 align:middle line:84%
three orders of magnitude,
which is very interesting.

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:16.520 align:middle line:84%
But now if we take and
translate that into some number

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.550 align:middle line:84%
that we can grasp, I
mean, who can picture

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:22.390 align:middle line:90%
what 7,920,000 feet is, right?

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:23.835 align:middle line:90%
Convert it to miles.

00:46:23.835 --> 00:46:27.810 align:middle line:84%
You divide it by 5,280
to convert it to miles,

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:30.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's 1,500 miles, right?

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go 1,500 miles.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:34.604 align:middle line:90%
What's 1,500 miles?

00:46:34.604 --> 00:46:35.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not as big as the moon.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:38.210 align:middle line:90%
That's 2,160, right?

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.620 align:middle line:84%
It's considerably
smaller than the Earth.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.190 align:middle line:84%
It's smaller than any of the
planets in the solar system.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It is actually about the size
of what an astronomer would

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:49.200 align:middle line:90%
call a planetesimal, right?

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, take the
diameter of the Earth

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and set it in relation
to this diameter

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.735 align:middle line:84%
of this hypothetical holy
city, and what you discover

00:46:57.735 --> 00:47:02.250 align:middle line:84%
is that ratio is exactly 5.28,
the ratio of the human pace

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:03.280 align:middle line:90%
to the human foot.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, 1,280, yeah.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, it is.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.896 align:middle line:84%
And this could go
on and on and on.

00:47:08.896 --> 00:47:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the point.

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in your
presentations, you

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.270 align:middle line:84%
have tables that show
these direct correlations

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:16.620 align:middle line:90%
and these reductions.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, you
say, OK, I've got it.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So that leads to much
bigger questions, of course,

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.800 align:middle line:84%
like how in the world
can this happen?

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:31.250 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about two
other numbers, 144, 144.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Most people when
they think of 144,

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:38.540 align:middle line:84%
other than the inches
in a square foot,

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:43.860 align:middle line:84%
they're looking at 144,000 that
are saved upon the Rapture.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.430 align:middle line:84%
That's probably-- those are the
two most common thoughts when

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.095 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the number
144 or 144,0000.

00:47:50.095 --> 00:47:53.210 align:middle line:90%
What is it actually?

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Why is that number associated
with salvation, for example,

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.920 align:middle line:90%
in that text?

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well, it
shows up-- geometrically,

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.146 align:middle line:84%
it shows up in the
star tetrahedron.

00:48:02.146 --> 00:48:03.520 align:middle line:84%
You know what a
star tetrahedron?

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I do.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:04.643 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: OK.

00:48:04.643 --> 00:48:06.215 align:middle line:84%
You have a
tetrahedron, which is--

00:48:06.215 --> 00:48:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I live in Sedona.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:07.910 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:08.940 align:middle line:90%
I have one hanging in my window.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: All right.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Star tetrahedron.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:15.100 align:middle line:10%
Well, each tetrahedron is
measured by 720 degrees.

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.890 align:middle line:10%
So the star tetrahedron was
measured by 1,440 degrees.

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:22.190 align:middle line:10%
So there's a geometric
correlation to that.

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:24.330 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of
Revelations, it's the wall

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.800 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the Holy
City that's measured

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.000 align:middle line:90%
by 144 cubits, these things.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the standard Hebrew
cubit was a foot and a half.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So then if you convert
144 cubits to feet,

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:44.740 align:middle line:84%
you get 216 feet,
or again, times 10

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.430 align:middle line:90%
is the diameter of the moon.

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of those key
numbers within this pattern,

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:55.860 align:middle line:84%
within this hierarchy of
fractal self-similarity.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a story about
Joseph of Arimathea,

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.845 align:middle line:84%
who removed the body of
Christ from the cross

00:49:01.845 --> 00:49:06.955 align:middle line:84%
and carried the holy grail
into Britain and founded

00:49:06.955 --> 00:49:07.455 align:middle line:90%
Glastonbury.

00:49:07.455 --> 00:49:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Glastonbury, yeah.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:08.790 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:09.498 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Right.

00:49:09.498 --> 00:49:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And in the stories, he
created a small circular hut,

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and then it was surrounded
by 12 huts around it,

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:23.810 align:middle line:84%
where each of his 12
disciples would live.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:24.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a model right there
of the Holy City, you see?

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:33.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the model that we find
over and over again in Jesus

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:37.280 align:middle line:84%
with 12 disciples,
Hercules with 12 labors,

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.140 align:middle line:90%
Buddha with 12 disciples, right?

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.330 align:middle line:90%
It goes on.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And geometrically, if
you have 12 spheres

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.170 align:middle line:84%
of exactly the same size,
they will cluster perfectly

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.865 align:middle line:90%
around a 13th.

00:49:48.865 --> 00:49:50.560 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
geometric clustering.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So in all of this stuff, there's
a geometric analog, you see.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what we're
ultimately talking about here

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:06.270 align:middle line:84%
is we're looking behind
the outer forms of things

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:10.200 align:middle line:84%
to see that there is a
pattern behind the outer form.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And we can recognize and
describe this pattern

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:15.460 align:middle line:84%
by means of these
numbers, and these numbers

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.234 align:middle line:84%
can describe patterns
both in space and in time.

00:50:18.234 --> 00:50:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And in time.

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.774 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:50:19.774 --> 00:50:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And supposedly
Solon's information

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.900 align:middle line:84%
about ancient
Atlantis was that it

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.875 align:middle line:84%
was laid out on these exact
same numeric principles.

00:50:28.875 --> 00:50:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.730 align:middle line:84%
What we get from there
is that there is a model.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.655 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have created with
my architectural software

00:50:34.655 --> 00:50:38.455 align:middle line:84%
a model of the Atlantean city
based upon Plato's description.

00:50:38.455 --> 00:50:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And didn't they
use the word stade as well?

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: They used
the word stade, yes.

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:42.673 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:42.673 --> 00:50:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Each of these--

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.383 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which would
have been passed

00:50:45.383 --> 00:50:47.980 align:middle line:84%
down to the Greeks and
Egyptians, Greeks, Romans,

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.606 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Because
Plato's "Dialogues"

00:50:50.606 --> 00:50:51.480 align:middle line:90%
are written in Greek.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: So he would
have used the word stade.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:51:00.185 align:middle line:84%
But according to the
transmission, Plato,

00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:04.530 align:middle line:84%
it was Critias the Younger who
got it from his grandfather

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Critias the Elder who
got it from, I believe,

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:10.564 align:middle line:84%
his uncle Dropides,
who got it from Solon.

00:51:10.564 --> 00:51:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Right.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
a couple hundred

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:13.650 align:middle line:90%
years removed, as I recall.

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:13.724 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:51:13.724 --> 00:51:15.223 align:middle line:84%
It was couple hundred
years removed.

00:51:15.223 --> 00:51:16.250 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Plato's account,

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:23.340 align:middle line:84%
it was transferred
to Solon on by

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:27.690 align:middle line:84%
these elderly Egyptian
priests, who presumably

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:29.260 align:middle line:84%
would have preserved
this knowledge

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:33.450 align:middle line:90%
for many, many centuries.

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the point being,
OK, there are lots of points.

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:41.410 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we have
this amazing overlay

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:45.030 align:middle line:84%
of sacred numbers and forms
through time and space

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that our whole life is imbued
with, everything on our planet,

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.960 align:middle line:90%
our cosmos is imbued with.

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, that begs the
question, how did that happen?

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:57.300 align:middle line:84%
There has to be some kind
of intelligence involved.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:01.680 align:middle line:84%
What is your perception of how
all of this grace came to be?

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well, this is
the teleological question.

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Is it design?

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:09.455 align:middle line:84%
And if you're oriented
to-- excuse me--

00:52:09.455 --> 00:52:14.010 align:middle line:84%
if you're oriented towards
that interpretation, as I am,

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:18.484 align:middle line:84%
yes, it reflects intelligence
throughout the universe.

00:52:18.484 --> 00:52:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An extreme
intelligence.

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Extreme intelligence.

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And that what we're
seeing here is a glimpse

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:28.600 align:middle line:84%
of this ultimate
pattern, which serves

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:33.740 align:middle line:84%
as the matrix upon which the
whole of creation is sustained.

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:34.900 align:middle line:90%
That's how I look at it.

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're ultimately derived
from that same pattern.

00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're like
walking embodiments

00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:41.970 align:middle line:90%
of these cosmic relationships.

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: And--

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sorry, go ahead.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well, so
that ultimately we're

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:53.100 align:middle line:84%
referring all of these things
back to the human dimension.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, the
idea of the temple

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:58.490 align:middle line:84%
is the mean that
serves-- because anytime

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:02.070 align:middle line:84%
you've got two incommensurable
numbers in mathematics, the way

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:05.880 align:middle line:84%
to bring them into harmony is
to introduce this third that

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.940 align:middle line:84%
relates to each of
them in a certain way

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and then can serve as a
unifying force between them.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.240 align:middle line:84%
That was a function
of the sacred temple.

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It served as the geometrical
mean between the human scale

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and the planetary scale.

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And probably the
most significant of all those

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:26.540 align:middle line:90%
would be the Great Pyramid.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Certainly yes.

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:29.810 align:middle line:84%
In our day and age,
the most significant

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is the Great Pyramid,
which embodies

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:35.092 align:middle line:84%
this incredible geometry
based upon the golden section.

00:53:35.092 --> 00:53:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same
thing, same numbers.

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:39.350 align:middle line:84%
It all keeps coming back to
the same thing reflective

00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:41.560 align:middle line:90%
of Earth's dimensions herself.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we scale
the Great Pyramid

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.980 align:middle line:84%
up by a factor of
43,200, which is

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:50.430 align:middle line:84%
one of the preeminent
sacred numbers.

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if
you think of this.

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.340 align:middle line:84%
In a 24-hour day, Earth
turns on its axis.

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Once that 24-hour
day is measured

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.040 align:middle line:84%
between a point on the
surface of the Earth

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and the position of the
sun-- so that if you picture

00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:08.680 align:middle line:84%
the sun as an orb with
a very precise dot

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:13.400 align:middle line:84%
right in the center, just like
the astrological symbol, right?

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.070 align:middle line:90%
OK

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, Earth turns on its axis.

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And each time a meridian
line exactly lines up

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:22.720 align:middle line:84%
with the center of the sun,
that's one 24-hour day.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:27.850 align:middle line:90%
24 hours times 60 is 1,440.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So there's 1,440
minutes in that cycle.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Then you multiply that times
60, and it's 86,400, right?

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Add one zero on the
end of that, and it's

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:44.600 align:middle line:84%
864,000, the measure of the
sun's diameter in miles, right?

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It's also the measure
of one of the great ages

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:52.390 align:middle line:84%
in Vedic system
called the Dwapara

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:56.260 align:middle line:90%
Yuga, which was 864,000 years.

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And the whole system of
the yugas was based--

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cycle of Brahma.

00:55:00.115 --> 00:55:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But the yugas, the kalpas,
the whole cycle of Brahma

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:10.480 align:middle line:84%
was based upon this
number 432, right, 432.

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So we find that showing up in
frequencies in musical scales.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.220 align:middle line:84%
In, I think, the
Phrygian mode, I believe,

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:21.990 align:middle line:90%
is where you find 432.

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I would have to reference
my notes on that

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.582 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not a
professional musician,

00:55:26.582 --> 00:55:28.415 align:middle line:84%
but it's been pointed
out to me by musicians

00:55:28.415 --> 00:55:32.810 align:middle line:84%
that these numbers are
embedded in the musical scale.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
higher octave of C

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and the octave is right in there
about 243 cycles per second.

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:43.576 align:middle line:10%
But then the next octave up is
528 cycles per second, right?

00:55:43.576 --> 00:55:44.242 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:44.242 --> 00:55:44.530 align:middle line:10%
That's correct, yeah.

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:45.113 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: OK.

00:55:45.113 --> 00:55:48.230 align:middle line:10%
So there's that 528
relationship again.

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.593 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: OK.

00:55:49.593 --> 00:55:51.730 align:middle line:84%
But in the yugas,
in the kalpas, it's

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:54.350 align:middle line:90%
based upon this number 432,000.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:58.560 align:middle line:84%
432,000 times 2,
864,000, times 3

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:02.670 align:middle line:84%
is 1,296,000 years
in this great cycle.

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, remember I said that
the total number of seconds

00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:09.480 align:middle line:84%
in a circle geometrically
is 1,296,000?

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So again, now the same
number measuring space

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.510 align:middle line:90%
and measuring time.

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the thing is,
people from many, many-- no one

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:19.632 align:middle line:84%
even knows how far
back-- understood this.

00:56:19.632 --> 00:56:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Right.

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They knew it.

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And this was the language of
the planet and of the cosmos.

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And the people and
those with knowledge

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.930 align:middle line:90%
were imbued with this knowledge.

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:32.380 align:middle line:84%
We forgot it all,
for good reason.

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And that it comes
to the cycles--

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:38.240 align:middle line:84%
our second conversation is
going to be about the cycles

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and where they
indicate catastrophe.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:40.925 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes.

00:56:40.925 --> 00:56:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there's
a natural beginning

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.740 align:middle line:90%
and end to everything.

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Right.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that's
conversation two.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.153 align:middle line:84%
We only have a few
minutes left in this one,

00:56:48.153 --> 00:56:50.629 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get to a couple
more numbers before we go.

00:56:50.629 --> 00:56:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll start fresh on
that subject when we come back.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: OK.

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:56.870 align:middle line:90%
360.

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Once upon a time,
there were considered

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.260 align:middle line:90%
to be 360 days in the year.

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.440 align:middle line:84%
That makes perfect sense
based on all these numbers.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.110 align:middle line:84%
305 doesn't make
any sense-- I mean,

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:08.420 align:middle line:90%
365 doesn't make any sense.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can get into
some esoteric background.

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I talked to Jose Arguelles
before he died about this,

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and he had a very specific
opinion about how that

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:19.500 align:middle line:90%
got inserted into our matrix.

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.270 align:middle line:84%
In the time when
365 were used, you

00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:24.540 align:middle line:84%
said that five of those
days were out of sync

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.670 align:middle line:90%
and considered unlucky.

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:29.397 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
for a couple minutes.

00:57:29.397 --> 00:57:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Well, I think--

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did we ever move
out of 360 days to the year?

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: I don't know
the answer to that.

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.320 align:middle line:84%
See, there's two possible
interpretations of that.

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.810 align:middle line:84%
A literal
interpretation, I guess,

00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:45.170 align:middle line:84%
there was once a time
when the year was

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:49.140 align:middle line:90%
360 days relative to the sun.

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:49.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of brings us back
to what you were bringing up

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:56.100 align:middle line:84%
in our first conversation
was this relationship

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:58.440 align:middle line:84%
between the Earth and
the sun maybe perhaps

00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.770 align:middle line:90%
being sort of out of sync.

00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:03.270 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is is that if
we look at all of the planets,

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:07.080 align:middle line:84%
we can see that with a little
bit of tweaking and adjustment

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.010 align:middle line:84%
the orbital periods
of all the planets

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:11.380 align:middle line:84%
will fall into line with
these sacred numbers,

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:14.620 align:middle line:84%
but none of them
hit exactly, right?

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's kind of like perhaps--
here's one possible metaphor.

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:24.210 align:middle line:84%
If you have a machine that's
based upon critical timing,

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:25.962 align:middle line:84%
like just your
automobile, for example.

00:58:25.962 --> 00:58:27.920 align:middle line:84%
You know what happens
when your automobile when

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:29.560 align:middle line:90%
the timing gets off.

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Blump, blump, blump.

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:33.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not smooth, right?

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I look at the solar
system as if maybe somehow

00:58:36.350 --> 00:58:39.290 align:middle line:84%
it's slightly out of
phase, out of adjustment.

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:41.417 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it never was.

00:58:41.417 --> 00:58:42.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that it ever was.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But the way I look
at it is that if we

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:50.370 align:middle line:84%
look at these patterns
and the numbers derived

00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:53.620 align:middle line:84%
from these patterns, I
think maybe one possible way

00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.300 align:middle line:84%
to interpret this
is that somehow

00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:57.920 align:middle line:84%
the ancient peoples
on this planet

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.200 align:middle line:84%
had such an intuitive or
intellectual understanding

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:05.010 align:middle line:84%
of this that they were
able to actually describe

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:08.210 align:middle line:84%
the idealized
blueprint of creation.

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And that gives us a
standard upon which

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.690 align:middle line:84%
to compare the
idealized blueprint

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:19.180 align:middle line:84%
with the actual real model
that we're inhabiting.

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:21.150 align:middle line:84%
As a builder, I know
that there's always

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:23.560 align:middle line:84%
a deviation between
the blueprints

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.860 align:middle line:84%
as the architect draws them and
the final structure that gets

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:27.360 align:middle line:90%
built.

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that could be the
simple answer to how we ended

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.880 align:middle line:90%
up with those five extra days.

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Yes, or could be.

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, another
possibility, though,

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:40.910 align:middle line:84%
is that something upset
the balance of things,

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's where this extra
five and a half days comes from.

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:46.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, and I don't
know that anybody does know.

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:48.336 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One more
question very quickly

00:59:48.336 --> 00:59:50.320 align:middle line:90%
because we're about out of time.

00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.300 align:middle line:90%
666.

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:55.330 align:middle line:84%
How has that been misconstrued
into the mark of the beast?

00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: OK.

00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:01.380 align:middle line:84%
666 has traditionally been a
number associated with the sun.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And typically, I think you
have to look at it this way.

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:09.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
look at the Earth right

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:15.980 align:middle line:84%
now orbiting the sun, every
second that goes by the Earth

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:25.420 align:middle line:84%
has moved in that orbital circle
18.5 miles per second, right,

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.310 align:middle line:90%
18.5.

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:28.729 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do the math on it.

01:00:28.729 --> 01:00:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll see
is that what that

01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:36.110 align:middle line:84%
translates into as miles per
hour is 66,600 miles per hour.

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are a
number of-- going back

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:41.322 align:middle line:84%
to what we were talking
about earlier-- the Gematria,

01:00:41.322 --> 01:00:43.990 align:middle line:90%
the numerical value of words.

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of
key words and names

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
in both the Old and
New Testament that

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
have the numerical value
of 666, and they're all

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:54.750 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
sun one way or another.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did it take
a negative connotation

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:58.720 align:middle line:90%
as almost demonic?

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: Well, OK, a simple
way of thinking of that

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
is imagine yourself naked
in the middle of the desert.

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
The sun isn't going to feel
like such a benevolent force

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.130 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, put yourself--

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.109 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Still, that's
a rather skewed--

01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: Extreme.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --extreme view--

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: It is.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.238 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of the sun.

01:01:17.238 --> 01:01:19.780 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: But on
the other hand,

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.340 align:middle line:10%
see, this gets us into a whole
other interesting question

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.340 align:middle line:10%
regarding the
variability of the sun.

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:26.042 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:28.000 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: And the
assumption that the sun is--

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.458 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I see
where you're going.

01:01:29.458 --> 01:01:30.450 align:middle line:10%
>>CARLSON: Yeah, yeah.

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
The assumption that the
sun is a steady state.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And what we find
is that cultures

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that lived in tropics or
in desert environments

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
have a different relationship
with the sun then,

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.992 align:middle line:90%
say, the Scandinavians.

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLSON: So I think you can
look at it-- in most cases,

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we, of course, look at
the sun as a benevolent force.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But there may be
times when it could be

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:55.702 align:middle line:90%
perceived as not so benevolent.

01:01:55.702 --> 01:01:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to end on that note

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:59.345 align:middle line:90%
and pick it up on the same note.

01:01:59.345 --> 01:02:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: OK.

01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.552 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Randall.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARLSON: This is fun.

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:05.671 align:middle line:10%
In our next
conversation, we're going

01:02:05.671 --> 01:02:07.440 align:middle line:10%
to be speaking about
these cosmic patterns

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.410 align:middle line:10%
and cycles of catastrophe.

01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
According to
Randall, these events

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.210 align:middle line:84%
have been encoded in
myth, sacred geometry,

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and mystical architecture
throughout the ages,

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.120 align:middle line:84%
telling us of our history and
warning us of upcoming events.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
