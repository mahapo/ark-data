00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: When was
the last time you simply

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:10%
sat and listened to music, eyes
closed, the rest of the world

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:10%
shut out?

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Today, music is more
used as background

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.730 align:middle line:84%
to a busy, even frantic life,
often adding even more noise.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Gary Malkin is with us today
to speak about the richness

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and depth our lives take
on when we give sound

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:90%
our full attention.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even when we don't
give it our full attention,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:84%
because you create
ambient music just

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
like background noise
in cafes yourself.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So Gary, let's start with--
almost your entire life,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:84%
you've been a musician,
but at what point

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:84%
did you start realizing
that music could be used

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
to aid in healing and alter
states of consciousness

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.066 align:middle line:84%
and-- how did that all
come about for you?

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:10%
>>GARY MALKIN: There
are many incidents

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:10%
all throughout my
life, but the one

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:10%
that I remember that's the
earliest was when I-- you know,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:10%
I started playing
the piano just by ear

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:10%
when I was five years old,
and apparently I could

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.890 align:middle line:10%
play anything I could hear.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:90%
I just sat down.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.168 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that when
there were-- you know,

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a typically
dysfunctional Jewish family

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.062 align:middle line:84%
where everybody was, you
know, like Woody Allen movies,

00:01:28.062 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
constantly interrupting
each other.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered
that when I was--

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:84%
it was just too much for me,
because I was a sensitive kid,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I'd go to the piano and
create a sanctuary for myself,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:90%
and I'd self-soothe.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:84%
On some level of
my being, I don't

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:84%
know if I was aware of
it, but on some level

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I recognized that everything in
the house started chilling out.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.545 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
Pavlovian experience, where

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I'd start to play
for my own well-being

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and then all the fights
started to subside

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and people started
getting more centered.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think on
some level I sensed

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
that there was a connection
between the music

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:90%
and the environment in the home.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's when I
started getting hooked to it,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
interesting, yeah.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.896 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder how many
people-- I did the same.

00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:84%
I'd come home from
school, drop the books,

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and start playing the piano,
and just play and play

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:90%
until I was calm.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.274 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: I think it
saved my life, honestly,

00:02:15.274 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
because I had this
experience where

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.050 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
presence wasn't very

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
common in this very
dysfunctional-- and loving,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:90%
but very busy family.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of
having a place that

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
was completely
whole and complete,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and have a place to just
resonate in the beauty of music

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.052 align:middle line:84%
was just a life-saving
experience.

00:02:34.052 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well and
as you said, you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:84%
helped heal the background noise
of your life in that household,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.076 align:middle line:84%
Did anyone ever comment on
it when you were growing up?

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Did they like you to play, or
did they find your practice

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
annoying or-- how did the rest
of the people in your family

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.152 align:middle line:90%
experience your music?

00:02:48.152 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: I didn't grow
up in a musical family.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, she was in the
kitchen cooking, and she said,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Gary, play "Happy
Talk"-- you know,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
a typical Jewish
Brooklyn mother--

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and there was one song she
loved from "South Pacific,"

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:90%
and I just thought, oh my god.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So I knew how to get her really
happy by just playing this one

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:90%
song.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, but there was
something, just in response

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
to your question, that
was-- fast forward

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:84%
to when I was just beginning
my film scoring career,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and I was watching the audience
on the opening night of a New

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.206 align:middle line:90%
York film festival.

00:03:19.206 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
documentary I did

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
that was about promoting
anti-nuclear-- an understanding

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:84%
of how nuclear
energy was affecting

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:84%
our lives in peacetime, and
how it was causing cancer

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:90%
from the downwind and all that.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
back of the audience,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.708 align:middle line:84%
and there was this
part of the film where

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:90%
it was so filled with despair.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.191 align:middle line:84%
And people were not
breathing, and you could just

00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
feel the place thick with
this energy of just like, ugh.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And then this theme
that I came up

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
with that was meant
to communicate hope,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
suddenly this oboe line came
in and I literally almost saw

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:90%
the air lift.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I heard people
breathing more deeply.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:90%
I was about 28 years old.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment to
me, as beginning my career,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that I went, oh my god, this
is so much more than just

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:90%
entertainment or show business.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:90%
It drives the emotions.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's what
isn't particularly well

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
understood a lot of times
in production in general,

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle line:90%
is how important the music is.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I used to produce
documentaries and lots

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
of other shows, and for
me it was always backward.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Usually, the musical
score is added last.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I had to hear
the sound of the music that

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
was going to accompany
the story before I ever

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:84%
saw the real story
or even the imagery--

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Yeah.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because people
live in their emotions

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:84%
when they're watching
these, and the music is

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:90%
what drives the emotions.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Totally.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, and music is the universal
language of the heart, right?

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: So if
you-- that says a lot

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.686 align:middle line:84%
about your emotional
intelligence,

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't have a
bottom-line grounder of what

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
it is emotionally
that you're feeling,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.644 align:middle line:84%
everything else is all just
noise and separate parts.

00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well and
in a story, you

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.775 align:middle line:84%
want to know the emotional
message that's being delivered.

00:05:00.775 --> 00:05:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: That's
the bottom line.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to be clear on it.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Right.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And music is
what takes people to it.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: It's
amazing, isn't it?

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.038 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really is.

00:05:07.038 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So amidst all of this, you
ultimately saw yourself--

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and as you explain
yourself to be,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
it's a different kind of-- a
music and health innovator.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Not a sound healer,
which I was kind

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:90%
of erroneously calling you.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what that means.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Well you know, we're
experiencing a renaissance

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.250 align:middle line:84%
of quantification, you
know, proof everywhere

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
around the power of
music and sound healing.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And right now, there's
a great leveling

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:84%
in the great tent
of sound and music,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:84%
because with neurological
studies and all this stuff,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:84%
we're actually seeing what
happens to our bodies,

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.580 align:middle line:84%
our minds, our
biological systems, when

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:84%
we expose ourselves to
that kind of listening

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:90%
and those kinds of sounds.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So I back-doored into
this through the power

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:90%
of film music.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was-- I wanted
to be John Williams.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.728 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wanted to
be a film composer.

00:05:55.728 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So my way into understanding
how human beings are affected

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
by music came through 25 years
of scoring television and film

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:90%
and commercials.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And I had a television show
called "Unsolved Mysteries"

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.010 align:middle line:84%
that I scored for
15 years, which

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.135 align:middle line:84%
was enough to drive me
crazy, but it was wonderful.

00:06:12.135 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:90%
It was a great team.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.661 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and that's
a very specific genre,

00:06:15.661 --> 00:06:18.302 align:middle line:84%
creating very specific
emotional responses.

00:06:18.302 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Well yeah,
it was happy and sad

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:90%
and everything in between.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But when I started to really
explore the idea of-- well,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:84%
it was really out of
my own need for healing

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
when a major loss
in my life happened.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I actually was drawn
to that, like how can I

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.580 align:middle line:84%
create the soundtrack
for my life

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:84%
at this point when loss has
hit me in a debilitating way.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
was drawn to create

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
this product with
Michael Stillwater called

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.260 align:middle line:90%
"Graceful Passages."

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And what it was was
taking spoken messages

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
around loss and
around transitions

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and scoring it in
a way that enables

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:84%
us to hear when we're so wigged
out by loss that we actually

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.116 align:middle line:84%
can't even hear words anymore
without that score that you

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:90%
were talking about, right--

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: --working
on documentaries.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So I came through this process
as a film composer looking

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
at how profound it is to receive
wisdom with film score music,

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and how biologically,
physiologically, spiritually,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
emotionally things
change in our ability

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
to be present in the
moment, to be engaged

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:84%
with our relationships, to
meet our transitions with more

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.120 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, you know?

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So over the launch of this thing
called "Graceful Passages,"

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
which was about 15
years ago, I started

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:84%
to explore, well,
my god, if music

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
can be the digestive enzyme
that allows us to process

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.205 align:middle line:90%
the main course of life--

00:07:45.205 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.621 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: --if it
can actually enable

00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:84%
us to assimilate
the meaning when

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
we're lost in new
transitions-- birth, death,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and everything in between--
you know, as they say,

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, what is it--
pain is inevitable,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
but suffering is
optional, right?

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.828 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: If there's a way
to alleviate the suffering

00:08:00.828 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:84%
by assimilating it with
music, by understanding it

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:84%
with your heart before
you even-- your mind does,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:90%
what else can it do?

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I started
to look at the greatest

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:90%
challenges in our life.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:90%
How we prepare for birth?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:90%
How we go through birth?

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, the pregnancy
issues, the bonding issues.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
How do we deal with
burnout with caregivers?

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:84%
How do we face the
3:00 AM moments

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:84%
when you're waiting for a
diagnosis with a cancer--

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
when you're worried
about cancer?

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal
with the end of life

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
when somebody is giving
you a terminal diagnosis?

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
These are these
bottleneck moments

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
that you notice in films
have very particular film

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
scores to make you feel
very particular things.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Well, what if
life is so complicated

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
now that we need a
private film score

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to help us assimilate
emotionally

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.530 align:middle line:90%
what's really going on?

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.037 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's how
things have gotten today.

00:08:49.037 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And we can talk more about that.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think that's a
really beautiful way to put it.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And I notice the
same thing, where,

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:84%
if there's a large
shift in life,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.360 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like I'm not fully
comfortable finishing whatever

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:84%
that is until I find the
right piece of music.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And then that piece
will always forever

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:84%
be linked to that time in life,
and that particular transition,

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:90%
as you call it.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's really important
to find the music.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: No, it's true.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it's interesting.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
The most common
association people

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:84%
have-- I love that you
said that-- is nostalgia

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:90%
associations, you know.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So like, we know that
song that was playing

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:84%
when we had our
first kiss, you know,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.747 align:middle line:84%
or those moments in
high school or whatever.

00:09:27.747 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's very important.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.732 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when someone's
dying, when you ask them,

00:09:31.732 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, what is the music
that you remember, many people,

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:84%
like, gravitate to
those pieces of music

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.085 align:middle line:84%
that bring back their
life review, you know?

00:09:38.085 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: But there's
also a new understanding

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:84%
that this health innovation,
music and health innovator

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
title that I've
recently adopted,

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:84%
leads us to, which is, you
know, we've always-- we've

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:90%
been in the age of information.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, IQ was the
most important, remember,

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.230 align:middle line:90%
in the 40s and 50s.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Then, we started integrating
holistic-- integration

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:90%
of holistic medicine.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And over the last 30
years, finally we're there.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're no longer in
the age of information,

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:90%
we're in the age of integration.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:84%
But now, coming in, that I
believe is the next big wave,

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
is the age of
vibrational intelligence.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.840 align:middle line:10%
Instead of EQ,
emotional intelligence--

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.200 align:middle line:10%
which is from holistic
integrative health-- I'd

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.060 align:middle line:10%
say VQ, for vibrational
intelligence,

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:10%
becomes how sensitive
are we to the resonance

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:10%
in the room, in our hearts,
in this engage between one

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:10%
another.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And music is the life
blood of vibration.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.800 align:middle line:90%
It's resonance.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The medium.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: It's frequency.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:90%
It's like the unified field.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:84%
We can't hear all
the vibrations,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
like the light spectrum,
but they're there.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So what if we can develop
VQ, vibrational intelligence,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.817 align:middle line:84%
in a way that uplifts our
game, makes us more empathic--

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: --connects us.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about--
and on an ambient level

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:84%
alone, because you've worked
with music for environments.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So when you're-- do you have
to have a very specific kind

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
of request, or maybe mandate,
for environmental music?

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you're
in an office space

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
where you have to
have really clear

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.594 align:middle line:84%
left brain attention,
what kind of music?

00:11:20.594 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:84%
How do you go about
creating that?

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.944 align:middle line:84%
Give us some ideas of some of
the notes and chords and such

00:11:25.944 --> 00:11:27.110 align:middle line:90%
that you would use for that.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Well, you're
bringing up my newest passion.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.847 align:middle line:84%
It's not something--
when I was 17,

00:11:32.847 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:90%
I was a big fan of Erik Satie's.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, that [SINGING]
da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: That
came and everybody

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.547 align:middle line:84%
embraced it like Pachelbel's
Canon was everywhere, you know?

00:11:42.547 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every--
and it's true there.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that in
a little bit, universally

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:90%
beloved tunes.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Right.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know, pieces.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.863 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Yeah, I can think that
Mozart thing from that famous

00:11:51.863 --> 00:11:53.845 align:middle line:84%
movie, [SINGING]
da-da-da-da-da-- yeah,

00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:84%
these things have
vibrational resonance, right,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.125 align:middle line:90%
to a certain kind of energy.

00:11:58.125 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm really passionate about
this subject right now.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's a new passion, because
ironically, when I was 17,

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
the Satie love, he
created this concept that

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:84%
happened in the
Paris exhibition I

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.927 align:middle line:84%
think in the late 1890s
called furniture music.

00:12:11.927 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
name of my private--

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Furniture music?

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Furniture music.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.256 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually the name
of my publishing company.

00:12:17.256 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And what it refers
to is, his belief

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.830 align:middle line:90%
was music is like furniture.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:84%
It sets the tone of a room
and makes you feel differently

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
when it's in the
room, right, and when

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:90%
it's strategically designed.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is way back
in-- many people consider

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:84%
the godfather of the
impressionist music movement,

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:90%
right, with Debussy and Ravel.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: So why--
how funny that now,

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.020 align:middle line:84%
after a 30-year career, this
is where I'm most passionate.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working with a company
called Aesthetic Audio Systems.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about it.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.482 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Well, Don Campbell
was one of our heroes

00:12:48.482 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:84%
from "The Sound and
Music Healing World."

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And Don Campbell wrote the
book-- he's from this area,

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:90%
in Colorado.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
He wrote the book "The
Mozart--" "The Mozart Effect--"

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Right?

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.169 align:middle line:84%
And he has done a lot of
understanding about how music

00:13:01.169 --> 00:13:02.460 align:middle line:90%
affects different environments.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of the
most advanced hospitals

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.790 align:middle line:84%
in the world that utilizes his
theories is here in Colorado.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And he, through
Aesthetic Audio Systems,

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
developed a way of designing
music for the waiting room,

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
for the pre-op, for the post-op,
for pain resolution, for that

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
health care green
room, the health

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:84%
care-- to recharge
and deal with burnout.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So he had these
zones, and he created

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
a hardware and a software
with his company that

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:84%
addressed this nuance
of vibrational ambient

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.660 align:middle line:84%
need for people to have
certain musical supports

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
for certain outcomes and certain
ideal ways of being, right?

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Aesthetic
Audio Systems does.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, Don died
a few years ago.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.737 align:middle line:84%
And his partners
were looking who

00:13:44.737 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
can be the one that
could replace him.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And I am so humbled by being
the one that they chose.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: We're
designing-- and I'm

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:84%
excited about this--
we're designing new tuning

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
systems for music that
bring greater stillness,

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and we're designing what I
call music for sacred space,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
or music for mindfulness
in this thing

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.750 align:middle line:90%
called "The Exhale Series."

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I've found is there's
a lot of slow music out there

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:84%
that chills you out, like that
music we just referred to,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.490 align:middle line:90%
that-- I forget-- "Madigan".

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:90%
I forget that film.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Elvira Madigan".

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: "Elvira
Madigan", thank you.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:90%
The score.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: But there
isn't a lot of slow music

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
that creates space to invite
you to live and do and be

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and engage and write
and-- most of it

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
is continuously
designed to be engrossed

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:90%
in the musical experience.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.075 align:middle line:84%
But what we need
more of is music

00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:90%
that has more spaciousness.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Furniture music.

00:14:37.283 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Furniture music.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And so this sacred space
piano improvisation music

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I've developed-- and other
types of music and instruments--

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
is designed to create
a musical idea,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and in it has the
rise and the fall,

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.005 align:middle line:84%
the breath and the-- like
life and the death, the birth

00:14:53.005 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:90%
and the death, right.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:84%
It has intrinsically in it
this initiation like the wave,

00:14:59.100 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:90%
and this relax.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:90%
And then there's space.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And something happens
autonomically to us

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.750 align:middle line:84%
when we are in a space where
there's that music that

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:84%
not only relaxes
us, but it engages

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:84%
a kind of mindful
alertness that allows

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:84%
us to step into our environments
and do what we came here to do.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's a very--

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: To be who
we came here to be.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a
natural kind of rhythm.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I've heard CDs,
meditative CDs, where

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.170 align:middle line:84%
breath is used, for
example, which I always

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
have found that to be very
powerful because you're falling

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
into a resonance with
the rhythm, you know,

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.524 align:middle line:84%
and toward whatever
end it's being used.

00:15:36.524 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if someone's
gasping for air,

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
that's a whole different deal,
but you know what I'm saying.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Of course.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just what you-- I
guess I'm just reflecting back

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.830 align:middle line:84%
the value in what you
just said, is anything

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:84%
that creates this cyclical
unconscious kind of patterning

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.200 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Well, they call it--

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That you fall
into resonance with.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're calling it in the
music therapy world, which

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.199 align:middle line:84%
is, you know, used
to be-- might still

00:15:56.199 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:84%
be one of the fastest-growing
fields in medicine,

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.725 align:middle line:90%
is entrainment.

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Entrainment, yes.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Right.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And so breath sends a signal
consciously and subconsciously

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:84%
to entrain like the mirror
neurons that you know about

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:84%
in our brain, it
actually creates

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
this remembering
that innately we're

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:84%
healthiest when we're in this
state of 70 beats per minute,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Or the-- you
know, the true sound healers

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.366 align:middle line:84%
that know this stuff for
real, because, like I said,

00:16:21.366 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I back-doored into this--
there is a state that's

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
optimal for human physiology
and human consciousness

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:90%
and human wellness.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.255 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, you know Peet's,
the coffee shop Peet's--

00:16:31.255 --> 00:16:32.088 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Of course.

00:16:32.088 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:90%
It's my favorite coffee.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.131 align:middle line:84%
The man who founded Peet's was
ahead of the game on that one.

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:84%
He understood that, if people
were going to be in his coffee

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
shop, he wanted to have
a certain coherence,

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:84%
so he only allowed
classical music.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, he has since
passed away, but that

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:52.520 align:middle line:84%
remained in the charter
that, into the future,

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.642 align:middle line:84%
that Peet's shall only
play classical music.

00:16:55.642 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: I didn't know that.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:90%
That's so great.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
You notice it doesn't
matter where you go,

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:84%
it's still classical
in all of the Peet's.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Wow.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I have
to say, depending

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:84%
on-- you know, if
I'm writing a script,

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:84%
for example, if I need
to be in a certain space,

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
often I'll go to Peet's
because that frequency is

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.190 align:middle line:84%
the one that's going to allow
for the most upliftment, rather

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.631 align:middle line:84%
than the randomness of
Pandora's coffee house

00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
mix somewhere, which could
be anything and, you know,

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.897 align:middle line:84%
very disturbing
to your thoughts.

00:17:21.897 --> 00:17:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Well, your product
placement sponsorship

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.396 align:middle line:84%
should be really
happy about this.

00:17:25.396 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:84%
We should contact
Peet's right away.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
well, their espresso

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
is a little heavy
for me, but anyway.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So another thing
you're working on

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:84%
is you're working with
a researcher at Antioch

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.520 align:middle line:90%
University in New England.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And what is-- and it's called
Five Portal Collaborative,

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:90%
the Five Portal Collaborative.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Well,
technically, it's

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:84%
a little bit premature,
because we're just

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:48.947 align:middle line:90%
building this vision now.

00:17:48.947 --> 00:17:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, can
you talk about it?

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.238 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: But I'm
really proud about it--

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
yeah-- because I feel like we
still don't have the tools yet

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:84%
to measure what I believe
will be the new most

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.246 align:middle line:84%
burgeoning part of
health and wellness,

00:18:02.246 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that I think is an
essential part of cleaning

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
up and improving why--
how we age and die

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
is the role of arts in
the health care world.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Because when you deal
with arts, you're

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:84%
dealing with the great healer--
the greatest healer, which

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
is nature, which is
beauty, which is color,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:90%
which is creativity, right.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you can strategize
those forces, which

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:84%
are direct from God-- you
know, the best things in life

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:84%
are free-- but when you can
strategize these resonant tools

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to create certain
environments, you

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:84%
create what I think
we're going to need today

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.342 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the stresses
and the challenges

00:18:38.342 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and the fears that
are actually coming up

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that are as a result of being
so addicted to digital devices.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: My fear right
now is that this belief

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.120 align:middle line:84%
that "I think, therefore
I am," that Descartes said

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
in the 1800s or
whenever, has become

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.244 align:middle line:84%
a bit of an imbalance
and a sickness that has,

00:18:59.244 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:84%
shall we say-- a sickness
might be too strong,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
but that the imbalance
means that we're all so

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.500 align:middle line:84%
word, verbal, mental,
linear-driven that--

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.100 align:middle line:84%
but neurolinguistics
programming,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:84%
this form of communication, NLP,
says that our communication is

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:90%
only 7% of our exchange.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So what about the
other 93, right?

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So the Five Portal
Collaborative is about how do we

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:90%
change the way we learn?

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can also
change the way we heal,

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and which I'm working on
a lot with, as I said,

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:84%
birth and death and
everything between.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:84%
But what if we change the
way we learned so that,

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:84%
instead of a mind only-- I
mean, you know the great cliche

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.390 align:middle line:84%
of academia is they're just
all minds and they're on these

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.884 align:middle line:84%
white towers and blah, blah,
blah, and they're all--

00:19:43.884 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Disassociated from the
reality on the ground, usually.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:10%
>>MALKIN: Well, another way to
put it, though, in Five Portal

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.490 align:middle line:10%
language-- I'm using
the term Five Portal,

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.156 align:middle line:10%
and I haven't even
secured the term yet,

00:19:52.156 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:10%
so I shouldn't have said
that-- but Five Portals refers

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.540 align:middle line:10%
to the mindfulness explosion
that's happening in our culture

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:10%
has happened because of the
scientific quantification

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.605 align:middle line:10%
of what neuroscience is showing
what happens with a meditating

00:20:03.605 --> 00:20:04.405 align:middle line:10%
brain.

00:20:04.405 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:90%
And we know now.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's amazing research
with Richard Davidson and Dan

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Siegel, and the marriage of
spirituality and biological

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.950 align:middle line:90%
facts, right?

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:84%
But what about that
part of us that

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.020 align:middle line:84%
bypasses our heart and our soul
and our spirit and our bodies,

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
even in the
mindfulness practice?

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.800 align:middle line:90%
I call it a spiritual bypass.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of people
who are still in mindfulness,

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:84%
but what about a
wholehearted mindfulness that

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:84%
has to do with mindfulness in
the intelligence of your body,

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:90%
your centering, your gut brain?

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.920 align:middle line:84%
What about mindfulness in the
intelligence of your soul?

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
As Thomas Moore says, the
intimate, sexual, story,

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:84%
personal, your
friends, the things

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:84%
you love, what about
mindfulness in your spirit?

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Spirit intelligence is access
to things larger than you,

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%
right, which is all
other intelligence,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:90%
all other vibration, right?

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And what about access to all
those intelligence-- body,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:84%
mind, heart, spirit,
and soul, right?

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.825 align:middle line:84%
Heart intelligence,
which, as you know maybe,

00:21:05.825 --> 00:21:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if other people
know, HeartMath for 20 years

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:90%
has developed this idea.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:90%
And you use the word coherence.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is, if
we're not working

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.430 align:middle line:84%
with all the engines
working, and we're not

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
engaged in any one of
those five portals,

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
depriving ourselves

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:84%
of the ability to
really empathically,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
compassionately, intelligently
communicate with one another.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And that means Putin
and Obama right down

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:84%
to our own internal
experience, right.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So I-- that's what it's
is about, the learning

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:90%
with all the engines working.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
that is very necessary.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I think
about it, it brings

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:84%
to mind-- you were talking about
those type of holistic healing

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.230 align:middle line:90%
of bringing all frequencies in.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And probably about--
almost 30 years ago,

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I did a story in Germany
at the Wegman clinic, which

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:84%
is a clinic based
on Rudolf Steiner's

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
anthroposophical medicine,
and it uses all frequencies.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.892 align:middle line:84%
I went into the
color chambers, and--

00:21:59.892 --> 00:22:00.808 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: I love that.

00:22:00.808 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They use sound,
eurythmy, the dance,

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.396 align:middle line:90%
they use nature.

00:22:04.396 --> 00:22:05.770 align:middle line:84%
All the rooms
look-- it's cancer.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Cancer-- it was primarily
then a cancer clinic.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it
is now-- looking out--

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.780 align:middle line:84%
every room looks out on
beautiful grassy and treed

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
areas.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:84%
The food is holistic
and tastes good.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing
that for years.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.607 align:middle line:90%
It's basics.

00:22:20.607 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: We've been living in
a culture that disparages that,

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Or has.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:25.920 align:middle line:90%
But now we're in a window.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.004 align:middle line:90%
There's an opening, right.

00:22:27.004 --> 00:22:28.378 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
say, the thing I'm

00:22:28.378 --> 00:22:30.160 align:middle line:84%
excited about around
Antioch University

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
is I didn't know that
their mission was,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.170 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you don't learn
for the purposes of making

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:84%
the world a better
place-- you know,

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.605 align:middle line:84%
they have five campuses
all over America,

00:22:38.605 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and they said then you're
wasting-- you know,

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.604 align:middle line:90%
then you should be ashamed.

00:22:41.604 --> 00:22:42.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's for.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And their mission is
see, feel, and act.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.236 align:middle line:84%
So their intention is
to take how you learn

00:22:48.236 --> 00:22:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and actually have
it be something

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:84%
that will leverage the place--
the world to be a better place.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
again-- and I mean,

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I sound like a
broken record here.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, I'm a fan.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.020 align:middle line:90%
You know, another commercial.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with the
education system in the Waldorf

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:84%
system-- and there are other
charter schools doing this

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:84%
now-- where it is
all integrated.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't start with
the intellectual pursuit

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
until the other
parts have already

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:90%
been integrated and developed.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: My daughter was at
Waldorf school, so I totally--

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
totally get-- yeah.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's not like the
models aren't there to do this,

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.412 align:middle line:84%
it just needs to
go mainstream now.

00:23:18.412 --> 00:23:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Well, it
needs to be integrated

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.262 align:middle line:90%
in a non-fundamental way.

00:23:21.262 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And you know, one of
the things that Antioch does

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is it's one of the few
graduate schools in New

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.449 align:middle line:84%
England of anthroposophy
and of Waldorf teachers.

00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And not to promote--
here we're doing

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Peet's and Waldorf's here.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.100 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
more importantly,

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:90%
to come back around to music--

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.648 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: What does music
have to do with this.

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:37.669 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: John O'Donohue,
the famous mystic

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.370 align:middle line:84%
who died a few years ago, the
Irish monk, talked about beauty

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.816 align:middle line:90%
as the great healer.

00:23:44.816 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful work, by the way.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Oh, god.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was beautiful.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And music is the
universal language of emotion.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Nature is the resource
for what people call biophilia,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:90%
the love of nature.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.530 align:middle line:84%
We are now understanding that
these things heal us, right,

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.104 align:middle line:84%
and create the conditions in
which our immune system is

00:24:02.104 --> 00:24:03.770 align:middle line:84%
a lot happier and a
lot more successful.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We just have
to give them a priority.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little--
if you don't mind--

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: No, no, thank you--

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --specifically,
because I kind of like

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.560 align:middle line:84%
the sciencey nuts and
bolts of things, and--

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Me, too.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
how we experience music.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about major
chords versus minor chords,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to
extend the conversation

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
into various cultures
of the world,

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
because maybe where major
chords might work well

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.690 align:middle line:84%
for the American population
to inspire a certain mood, not

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
necessarily true in
the Asian countries.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: True.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.412 align:middle line:84%
I swear, it's as if
you'd known me for years,

00:24:36.412 --> 00:24:37.870 align:middle line:84%
because for you to
say this is just

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:90%
like giving candy to a baby.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:84%
When I was 17, I went to
Oberlin and I was a double major

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:84%
in-- well, first I went to USC,
and then I went to Oberlin.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was a double
major in ethnomusicology

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:90%
and composition.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was intuitively
drawn to how

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:84%
the musics of different
cultures expanded my awareness.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.330 align:middle line:84%
What I now know is that, when
you actually subject yourself

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.120 align:middle line:84%
to music that you're
not familiar with,

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.840 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
expand your ability

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:84%
to relate to other, to
the things that are not

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:84%
familiar to you, in a way that's
transferable so that you're

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.955 align:middle line:84%
more accepting and more
resilient to expose yourself

00:25:13.955 --> 00:25:16.330 align:middle line:84%
to things that are different
than you, which is something

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:84%
we really need in
this culture today

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:84%
based on all the fear
of differences, right.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Xenophobia
is a word that's

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:90%
popping up all over the planet.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Exactly, right?

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: So that level
is one of the basic levels

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I love about exposing
yourself to different musics

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.180 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Brings you-- makes you embrace
the human range of experience,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.020 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And through-- I call the
ethnic music of a culture

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
the hieroglyphic thumbprint
of a culture's soul, right.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:84%
But on the level that
you're talking about,

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:84%
there are definite
emotions that are not

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:90%
correlative in all the cultures.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I went to-- I'm a big lover
of the Balinese culture.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a
gamelan and all that,

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:90%
which is a Balinese orchestra.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.990 align:middle line:84%
But be careful
what you wish for.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
During my honeymoon,
my wife and I

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.840 align:middle line:84%
got stuck for seven or eight
hours in one of these gamelan

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.362 align:middle line:84%
competitions, and we wanted
to kill ourselves after that.

00:26:05.362 --> 00:26:07.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it maybe
wasn't your vibe, necessarily,

00:26:07.895 --> 00:26:08.770 align:middle line:90%
your frequency range.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Well, it was--
We were-- Yeah, yeah.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's
talk about that.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.005 align:middle line:90%
What is that happens?

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you can even
boil it down to something

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:84%
as simple as major or
minor, or certain dominance

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.250 align:middle line:84%
of certain type-- certain
chords in certain cultures.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we often-- again,
if an American is listening,

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:90%
we can use John Williams.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:84%
You brought him up
earlier as an example.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Everybody resonates pretty much
with John Williams's music,

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:84%
which is why he's, what, the
most famous scorer of films

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:90%
in America?

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.185 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Well but
you know, I'm going

00:26:36.185 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:90%
to say something about this.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.761 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons I love
John Williams, and also

00:26:38.761 --> 00:26:40.497 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Newman and
Ennio Morricone,

00:26:40.497 --> 00:26:42.080 align:middle line:84%
these are the masters
of the film art.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.759 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
there's Philip Glass.

00:26:43.759 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: That's another genre.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A different deal.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:45.760 align:middle line:90%
A different genre.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: I mean, he's
crossed over into movies.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.546 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: But one
of the reasons I

00:26:48.546 --> 00:26:52.064 align:middle line:84%
love these composers
is, metaphorically,

00:26:52.064 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:84%
who these composers--
what they've

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:84%
done since Max
Steiner in the '30s

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:84%
is that they've been mapping
the musical emotional genome.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Right?

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what chords,
what genres, what timbres,

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:84%
what rhythms, what
melodies, what textures

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:84%
map to the emotional range
of the human experience.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To drive
us toward that end.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Right.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And they've mastered
it almost to the point

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:84%
where they're almost
influencing other cultures.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So now it's almost
become universal,

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
because what is the
largest export of America?

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.275 align:middle line:90%
Entertainment.

00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: The media
business, right?

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: The films
and everything,

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:84%
black marketed
everywhere no matter even

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:90%
if you're in Papua New Guinea.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, I've picked
them up for $1 in Chiang Mai.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Exactly, right?

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Laying down
in someone's truck.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Right.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there's
way much that we

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.160 align:middle line:90%
don't understand about this.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.120 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that there's--
if you would talk about major

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and minor, those are the primary
colors of the experience.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:84%
They're very obvious--
not to disparage

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.870 align:middle line:84%
it-- the very obvious
primary colors

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:90%
of the distinctions of music.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.945 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And the modes and
the Greek modes in early

00:27:55.945 --> 00:27:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Pythagorean time of talking
about the powers and energetics

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:90%
of each mode--

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: There were like,
you know, seven modes, right?

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:84%
But in the Indian
raga system, there

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.890 align:middle line:84%
are 5,000 ragas, which
is another form of mode,

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And every one of those
ragas was designed

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.850 align:middle line:84%
to create a certain
effect in the human being.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But it also-- they
had-- I studied with Ali

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Akbar Khan, Indian
classical music,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
when I was-- took my leave
of absence from Oberlin.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So I've had a lot-- my passion
in my film composing career

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:30.410 align:middle line:84%
has been about integrating
music from different cultures,

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:31.770 align:middle line:90%
and authentically so.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Not giving lip service
to it, if you will.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's get--

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: So those
distinctions, just to finish--

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Those
distinctions are yet

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:84%
to be fully understood
on why they work.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.812 align:middle line:84%
But I think they come down to
what the realm of intervals.

00:28:44.812 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And many people who
don't know what music

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:51.460 align:middle line:84%
is, the interval is the
actual vibrational frequency

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.830 align:middle line:90%
between one note and another.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And when Pythagoras
and Pythagorean tuning created

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.510 align:middle line:84%
it through the music of the
spheres, through mathematics,

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:06.500 align:middle line:84%
they noticed that it actually
occurs in nature, the pi ratio

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Fibonacci sequence,
these are all Pythagorean

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:09.930 align:middle line:90%
sacred geometric things.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, they correspond
to sounds, right?

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can alter those
sounds in a way that

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
effects the human body,
mind, heart, spirit,

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and soul in very unique
ways that we're just

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.250 align:middle line:90%
beginning to understand.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, and--

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: It's a heady topic.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is a heady topic.

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to go
back and have you speculate.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, having
spent time in Asia,

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.260 align:middle line:84%
having spent time in the Middle
East and India, and America,

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.880 align:middle line:84%
for example, whatever it is
that John Williams is appealing

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.940 align:middle line:84%
to in his music to the Western
emotional structure, what

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
is happening more in the
Eastern emotional structure

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.190 align:middle line:90%
with the music there?

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Totally different instruments,
different intervals.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Well--

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't-- I don't
know-- I don't-- you--

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Yeah.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.348 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't even
have the language,

00:29:53.348 --> 00:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
except that I know I
feel very differently

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's not-- I don't
feel as coherent.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Or--

00:29:59.010 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Personally.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: But here's
the beautiful thing--

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not that
that's a bad thing.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:90%
It might be pushing me.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: I love-- I
love that you said that,

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.870 align:middle line:84%
because this is the distinction
that I want to make.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the word
coherent is an accurate one

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.490 align:middle line:90%
to describe what you're saying.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, what is?

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: This is why I
said that sometimes exposing

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
yourself to things that
are not comfortable--

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.926 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: --or
familiar, sometimes

00:30:16.926 --> 00:30:19.810 align:middle line:84%
are simply because they're
not the neuronal pathways,

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:90%
for those of-- you know.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to explain that?

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Certainly not to you.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
need to explain.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Our neuronal pathways
are used to certain sounds.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.822 align:middle line:84%
And getting over
the unfamiliar--

00:30:28.822 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And certain cadences
and all of that, yeah.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.572 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: --can be an uplifting
and expanding experience that

00:30:33.572 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:90%
might not be about coherence.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:90%
It might be about unfamiliarity.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah--

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Discomfort
with the unfamiliar.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think we
all have this, where--

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Of course.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.189 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I listen to
mostly world music, right,

00:30:41.189 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:84%
so I'm-- a cross blend of
music from around the planet,

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.130 align:middle line:84%
but there are still certain
sounds that I just don't--

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Right.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, I mean--

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
don't do it for me.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.090 align:middle line:90%
They don't take me anywhere.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.006 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Arabic music
has like a half, like--

00:30:53.006 --> 00:30:55.914 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING] da-da-da-da-da-da.

00:30:55.914 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a little less
than the minor third.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And at first when
I heard it, it was like,

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.790 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.876 align:middle line:84%
And in Indian music,
south India has many,

00:31:02.876 --> 00:31:04.500 align:middle line:84%
many different what
they call shruti's.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.955 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING] da-da-da.

00:31:06.955 --> 00:31:07.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:31:07.755 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Right, right, right.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Sliding through.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And I was
singing Indian music,

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.660 align:middle line:90%
and I still do to some degree.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a great passion of mine.

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So I love this topic,
and I think that it's

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.070 align:middle line:90%
worth great-- more inquiry.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.683 align:middle line:84%
But I'll do one major
bold comment about it.

00:31:21.683 --> 00:31:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: The East
has been a place that

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.980 align:middle line:84%
has preserved more of what we
would call monophonic music,

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:31.806 align:middle line:84%
or where the note is more--
the music's more horizontal.

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's
a drone underneath--

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.945 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: --and
there's a melody--

00:31:34.945 --> 00:31:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: --that weaves over the
tapestry of the drone, right?

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: That's one note.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Ever since Palestrina
and Telemann and Bach,

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that's polyphonic, and that
has sometimes-- has harmonies.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Counterpoint.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: Five melodies
happening at once in a fugue.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
fundamental difference.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think-- this is
why one of my newest project

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:84%
is called "Divine 9
Tuning," "Divine 9 Music."

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a new tuning system
that's come out of Amsterdam.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:05.859 align:middle line:84%
And my newest product is going
to be called "All is Well."

00:32:05.859 --> 00:32:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And the music
subtitle, I don't know,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's basically using a new
tuning system where every note

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.500 align:middle line:84%
is divisible by nine, which is
the-- nine is the Pythagorean

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.375 align:middle line:90%
number of stillness--

00:32:16.375 --> 00:32:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And the pi
ratio and all the things.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And so every
note is divisible by nine,

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:29.880 align:middle line:84%
which makes the experience
be-- can I say deeply, deeply

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.040 align:middle line:90%
catalytic of a stillness state.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I created
a 46-minute track

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.660 align:middle line:84%
that's designed for, you
know, sessions, massages,

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and deep healing
sessions that-- where you

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.460 align:middle line:90%
let that music just infuse you.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you want
more information,

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.200 align:middle line:90%
go to divine9music.com.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Divine 9, OK.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: .com, yeah.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All
right, divine9.com.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: You're asking me
all my favorite questions.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.241 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm glad.

00:32:49.241 --> 00:32:51.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, I have just a couple
more before we wrap up.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do
with birthing someone

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:84%
into the world and
that phase of music,

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and then one that
you also work with,

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.640 align:middle line:84%
which is music to
transition and help people

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.170 align:middle line:84%
at end of life, which the boomer
generation who is now starting

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.200 align:middle line:84%
to go through that process
isn't handling very well, being

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.200 align:middle line:90%
the me generation.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Right.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Well you know, the
health care system

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.470 align:middle line:84%
has done an extraordinary
job in dealing

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.490 align:middle line:84%
with every other passage
except the end of life.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And
frankly-- I don't want

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.311 align:middle line:84%
to be harsh, although there's
a lot of things that are coming

00:33:23.311 --> 00:33:25.800 align:middle line:84%
out with especially Atul
Gawande's book called "Being

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.866 align:middle line:84%
Mortal," there is a lot
of new information coming

00:33:29.866 --> 00:33:31.240 align:middle line:84%
that really says
that we're still

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.429 align:middle line:84%
in quite a barbaric
time around facing

00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:35.470 align:middle line:90%
eldering and end of life.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And how we
dispose of the elders

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.660 align:middle line:84%
as trash, in a certain way,
and put them in nursing homes

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.792 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, drug
them and all this.

00:33:43.792 --> 00:33:46.280 align:middle line:84%
This is my greatest passion
and my greatest commitment.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.130 align:middle line:84%
If I had a year to live, all I'd
do is focus on the end of life,

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:53.232 align:middle line:84%
because its effect on everyone
in the culture is not just

00:33:53.232 --> 00:33:54.690 align:middle line:84%
for those who are
going through it,

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.260 align:middle line:84%
but for all of us who are
watching and supporting

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and loving the people we
love the most going through

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:84%
unbelievable endless
interventions that undermine

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:09.239 align:middle line:84%
the quality of life as they're--
what really needs to happen is

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:12.230 align:middle line:84%
we need to acknowledge that
there's something called sacred

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.870 align:middle line:84%
that isn't defined by a
religion but is defined

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:19.770 align:middle line:84%
by an inclusivity that includes
religion but doesn't define it.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And music and the arts are the
perfect non-dogmatic catalyst

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't bring an argument
about what faith are you

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.949 align:middle line:84%
before you go and what, you
know, bring in last rites.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's make it sacred on
a universal level that

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.530 align:middle line:84%
allows the beauty of
music to remind us

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:84%
that we're hardwired to be able
to say, I love you, thank you,

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, I forgive
you, goodbye,

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.989 align:middle line:84%
in the famous words of the
five things that-- Ira Byock,

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:84%
the famous doctor who-- so
we're hardwired to do that.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And what do we do
when we are actually

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.730 align:middle line:90%
about to lose somebody?

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.447 align:middle line:84%
Put them wires in,
do this intervention,

00:34:58.447 --> 00:35:01.030 align:middle line:84%
do this surgery no matter what
it's going to do to their life.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's an atrocity.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And we need to understand-- I'm
not saying that we don't need

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.520 align:middle line:84%
to do something about it when
it's trying to save a life

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.527 align:middle line:90%
if it's realistic, but--

00:35:09.527 --> 00:35:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, but what
you're speaking about

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.190 align:middle line:84%
is almost gratuitous, and it
is barbaric in its own way,

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.931 align:middle line:84%
what it puts that
person through.

00:35:16.931 --> 00:35:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: We're so hungry
to hold onto somebody,

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.513 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know
that we're hardwired

00:35:20.513 --> 00:35:22.350 align:middle line:84%
to die the way we're
hardwired to be born.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And so
when we're born,

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.710 align:middle line:84%
the other thing that
is now troublesome

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.480 align:middle line:90%
is the bonding process.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And the bonding-- new
studies have shown out

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:33.580 align:middle line:84%
of Germany that are
mind-blowing-- what's his name?

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I forget his name.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Schroth?

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.490 align:middle line:84%
He discovered a way of bonding
with the baby in the womb

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:43.160 align:middle line:84%
through different practices in
music that actually has created

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.324 align:middle line:84%
results so that the babies
sleep through the night,

00:35:45.324 --> 00:35:46.740 align:middle line:84%
they're less
collicky, and they're

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.430 align:middle line:84%
more in this state
of all is well--

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes perfect sense.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: --rather than the
shock into the world, right?

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are you
doing all is well movie--

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.142 align:middle line:90%
music now for both the--

00:35:54.142 --> 00:35:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: For the
beginning and end, yes.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beginning
and end of life?

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: Yes.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.473 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:35:57.473 --> 00:35:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Resonant Sounds,
or lisarafel.com.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.400 align:middle line:84%
We're doing actually a musical
called "Can You Hear Me Baby,"

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.651 align:middle line:84%
which is songs and stories
about love, sex and OMG birth.

00:36:06.651 --> 00:36:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wonderful.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:09.774 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And it's all
about basically like "Vagina

00:36:09.774 --> 00:36:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Monologues" on
pregnancy and birth--

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.553 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And around the
choices that we can make.

00:36:14.553 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Because again, the
doorways-- beginning

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.810 align:middle line:84%
of life, end of life-- have
ramifications and ripples

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.650 align:middle line:90%
that affect every part.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:26.060 align:middle line:84%
If we don't bond properly,
then that has ramifications

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
on the child's ability to
regulate and self-regulate

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and deal with issues
of resilience--

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.458 align:middle line:10%
>>MALKIN: And a sense
of feeling like all

00:36:32.458 --> 00:36:34.070 align:middle line:10%
is well and like
you're not looking

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.310 align:middle line:10%
through the world as an
enemy, but as a collaborator.

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:39.129 align:middle line:10%
So music strategically
designed to do

00:36:39.129 --> 00:36:40.670 align:middle line:10%
that is something
that I've developed

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:42.274 align:middle line:10%
with the "safe in
the Arms of Love--"

00:36:42.274 --> 00:36:43.190 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: All is well.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And all is
well at the end of life--

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.190 align:middle line:84%
that experience of
dropping into trust,

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:51.530 align:middle line:84%
as a child of a Jewish family
that has defined I suffer,

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:52.330 align:middle line:90%
therefore I am--

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: --has been a
major issue in my life.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think, as
a wounded healer,

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking
for ways to use music

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:84%
that can be practical tools to
help us trust that, even when

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.760 align:middle line:84%
we lose, even when things--
horrible things happen,

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.384 align:middle line:84%
that there's a-- kind of
looking at it from, like,

00:37:11.384 --> 00:37:13.550 align:middle line:84%
if the angels looked at it,
if you believed in them.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Or looking at it from
a larger perspective,

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:19.240 align:middle line:84%
we're not in control
of this, you know?

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: There's
something much larger

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.830 align:middle line:84%
holding us all, whether
you believe in God or not.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.079 align:middle line:90%
There's something much larger.

00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:25.780 align:middle line:10%
And I think the
power of music is

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.200 align:middle line:10%
it can wake us up
to that connection

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.090 align:middle line:10%
to something much
larger than ourselves.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:30.385 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:30.385 --> 00:37:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And that's
my goal in this life.

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:33.023 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:37:33.023 --> 00:37:34.660 align:middle line:84%
You are here to help
relieve suffering

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.337 align:middle line:84%
and to offer upliftment
through that frequency.

00:37:37.337 --> 00:37:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MALKIN: That's it.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I appreciate that.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.881 align:middle line:84%
>>MALKIN: And the doorways
are one of the biggest

00:37:40.881 --> 00:37:41.720 align:middle line:90%
places we can do it.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.870 align:middle line:90%
