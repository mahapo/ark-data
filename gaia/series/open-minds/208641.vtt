is the bonded and often intimate

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.620 align:middle line:84%
relationship between a human

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:84%
This extraordinary being
kept showing up in my dreams.

>>ROSE: Yes.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.740 align:middle line:84%
The spirit marriages-- they
happen because that there's

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:84%
some sort of co-creative project
that only you and your spirit

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:90%
beloved can do.

>>REGINA: Many years ago,
I interviewed Barbara Lamb,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:10%
and the topic of
our conversation

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:10%
was her spirit marriage
to a reptilian who

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:10%
was of a more noble type.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Today's guest, Dr. Megan Rose,
learned through her studies

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
that spirit marriage was
actually a thing historically

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:90%
and around the world.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Today, she's going to tell
us about this phenomena

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:84%
in which a human being is
married with a spirit being.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:90%
This is a really juicy topic.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:90%
I think people find this very--

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:84%
I found it intriguing when
I interviewed Barbara Lamb,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and that was maybe 15 years ago,
and I haven't talked to anybody

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.600 align:middle line:90%
about that since then.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.857 align:middle line:90%
So welcome, Megan.

00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Thank you so much.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.605 align:middle line:84%
I'm just thrilled
to be here today.

>>REGINA: May I read something
that I found on your site--

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Mm-hmm.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in your video
about spirit marriage?

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.550 align:middle line:84%
You read a little bit
of Thomas Moore's book,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
"Care of the Soul."

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:90%
And this was the quote from it.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.990 align:middle line:84%
"It's in the nature
of things to be

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
drawn to the very experiences
that will spoil our innocence,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:84%
transform our lives, and
give us necessary experience

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:90%
and depth."

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:90%
I wrote it down at the time.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:90%
I paused your video.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And I have to bring
that up because clearly

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.587 align:middle line:84%
you brought it up toward
the beginning of your talk,

00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:90%
so it was important to you.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So tell us why that is
important and then weave that

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:84%
into how you began
in this field.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Mm-hmm.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.010 align:middle line:10%
Well, the idea that it's sort
of spoiling our innocence

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.860 align:middle line:10%
and opening us up,
transforming us,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:10%
is what really I find so
juicy about that quote.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:10%
And in my own life I was--

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:10%
I'd done a master's in
seminary and religious studies

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:10%
and was kind of what I
considered to be pagan-lite.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But I had a very strong
upbringing where,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
in my Pentecostal
upbringing, where

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.685 align:middle line:84%
channeling the Holy
Spirit was just

00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:90%
sort of par for the course.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what we did.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Opening to
entities, opening to energy,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.225 align:middle line:84%
and letting it flow through
you, so that was part

00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:90%
of your being, your makeup.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yes.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.905 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:51.447 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had
a lot of experience

00:02:51.447 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:84%
in experiencing
external energies.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, my childhood
was the Holy Spirit primarily.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Although when I was an
infant, less than a year old,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I had a birth defect
in my kidneys.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And the minister, my mom, my
aunts, my grandmother, all

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
anointed with me with oil and
prayed the Holy Spirit fire

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:90%
into my body.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.577 align:middle line:84%
So this is like
before I can talk,

00:03:13.577 --> 00:03:15.150 align:middle line:84%
before I even know
what's going on.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I really trace my
opening back to that moment.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Because that's when the
veils between the world--

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:84%
before I even knew
that there should

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:84%
be a veil between the
world-- were thin for me.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was raised with just
this tremendous amount

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
of what I now understand
is chaukdi, this potency.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But as a child, it was just
me channeling the Holy Spirit,

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:90%
speaking in tongues.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did you see beings?

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.772 align:middle line:90%
Or did you see the Holy Spirit?

00:03:45.772 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Were these-- were there
any visual perceptions?

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.653 align:middle line:84%
Or it was mostly a feeling
moving through you?

00:03:49.653 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: It's the felt sense.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm mostly somatic in my
extrasensory capabilities.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.108 align:middle line:84%
And so it was this feeling
like your tail's on fire,

00:03:59.108 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's shooting out
the top of your head,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and everything around you
is vibrating at brighter

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.580 align:middle line:90%
and brighter speeds.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
So growing up like that, I
really only found two places

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
that I could really feel
grounded and safe in that.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:90%
And one was in nature.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I had a tree companion, an
oak tree, a live oak, a huge,

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
200 year old, and I
used to climb up into it

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.612 align:middle line:84%
and rest my spine
against the trunk--

00:04:26.612 --> 00:04:27.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I relate to that, yes.

00:04:27.945 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: --and sing to it,
and just sing and talk to it.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And so that was one of
the safe places where

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that amount of energy and that
extrasensory or otherworldly

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:90%
perception was really supported.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke to the
nature spirits.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:90%
I spoke to the tree.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, also,
in the Pentecostal

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
services of my
childhood, where I

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
was the kid with her little
arms raised in the front row,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
riding the [CHUCKLES] spirit.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, the
interesting thing

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:84%
is that it felt a lot like just
this powerful erotic energy

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.590 align:middle line:90%
flowing through me.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.900 align:middle line:90%
It felt wonderful.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.646 align:middle line:84%
And I think the adults in the
church would sort of think--

00:05:08.646 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's getting
out of control a bit here.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: But it's an
interesting corollary phenomena

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
between what the
Pentecostals are working with

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and what the shamanistic and the
spiritualists-type communities

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:90%
are doing.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the
same thing, but it's

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
just that it's got this very
regimented, highly structured

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
way in which it's allowed to be
done in the Pentecostal church.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:84%
It was all about the Holy
Spirit, which later I

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:84%
understood was just
Wisdom, Sophia,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
the goddess, the divine feminine
that was moving through me.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you go ahead, and
you're a very curious person.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:90%
You love education.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.950 align:middle line:90%
So you completed your master's.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, you were
pagan-lite at this point

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:90%
in religion.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And then this
something happened,

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and you learned about
this other thing.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead
and dive into it.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
First of all, give
us a definition

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:84%
of what spirit marriage
is, and then we'll

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.355 align:middle line:90%
kind of back into the story.

00:06:02.355 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: So spirit marriage is
the bonded and often intimate

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
relationship between a human
and an otherworldly being,

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:84%
or an extraordinary
being, is what

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I kind of prefer to call
them because sometimes they

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:90%
are of this world.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:90%
And it shows up transculturally.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
When I first encountered
this phenomenon, which

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.500 align:middle line:84%
was in my early 30s, I had gone
through a Kundalini awakening

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.400 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I-- I like
to say I was sort

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.342 align:middle line:84%
of like lit up on
the spirit realms,

00:06:36.342 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and I had to go through the
whole process of learning

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:84%
how to really safely and
sanely navigate that.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:84%
But this extraordinary being
kept showing up in my dreams.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was the same
being because my body responded

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the same way every
time they would appear.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And over the course
of a few years,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.165 align:middle line:84%
they started asking
me to marry them.

00:06:57.165 --> 00:06:59.205 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, was this
disconcerting at first?

00:06:59.205 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: Well, it
wasn't disconcerting.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:90%
It was more like perplexing.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.239 align:middle line:90%
Like, what?

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:06.156 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, yeah.

00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: Like, what do
you mean, marry you?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: But I had--
in seminary, we

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
had studied the Book of Enoch,
the early account of the angels

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:84%
marrying human woman,
and then they're

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:90%
giving birth to the Nephilim.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that appeared
in my mind, or I--

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
remembered that, yeah.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: --had this reference.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
well, this must--

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:90%
maybe this is a thing.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, I think this
might be a thing.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Because from my religious
studies, I remembered--

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I started remembering little
pieces like in the Vodou

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:90%
And so I was like, hmm.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:90%
So this was early 2000s.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think I like,
Netscape 2000ed it--

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: --to try
and figure out--

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.412 align:middle line:84%
and I think I just typed
in spirit marriage.

00:07:53.412 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if
that was the term,

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
but that's what I typed in
because the spirit wanted

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:90%
to marry me.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:90%
And Ida Craddock came up.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And there was a website
that had been put up

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to this woman who
was an early, 20th-century

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:84%
spiritualist and who
was married to an angel.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote this
beautiful treatise

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:90%
called "Heavenly Bridegrooms."

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.793 align:middle line:84%
And it really outlined--
she kind of gave me--

00:08:16.793 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
her name again?

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.165 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Ida Craddock.

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:19.965 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: And she
kind of gave me--

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:84%
she's been one of
my patron spirits

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:84%
because she kind of gave me the
primer or the basis of where

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:90%
to start looking.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.280 align:middle line:90%
And so I found--

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.438 align:middle line:84%
because she-- in that book,
"Heavenly Bridegrooms,"

00:08:34.438 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:84%
she talks about the
tradition of spirit marriage.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And she's done a pretty
good job of tracing it,

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
although she wasn't
an academic herself.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.640 align:middle line:84%
But she is somebody that,
like the ceremonial magicians,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:84%
have sainthood because
she was a sexologist.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.860 align:middle line:84%
She advocated for the
radical [GASP] idea

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that women should
enjoy sex, right?

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And, also, women sort of
embodied spirituality.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.222 align:middle line:84%
She was a forerunner
of that and this thing

00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:90%
called spirit marriage.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like, OK,
so I'm not off my rocker.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:90%
There's something here.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And I just need to
dig into it more,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and that the more I dug into it,
the more I became fascinated.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And also it was
enhancing my own contact.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about your
own contact for a little bit

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:90%
with this being.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So this being had
been appearing,

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and they asked
you to marry them.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.260 align:middle line:84%
What was the nature
of the being?

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.802 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
nature of-- what did

00:09:26.802 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:90%
your relationship develop into?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Mm-hmm.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So the nature of the
being was twofold.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So he showed up, and it
was mostly presenting

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:90%
as a male sort of energy.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It showed up as the either
an angelic-type being,

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.610 align:middle line:84%
like brilliant light or this
really chthonic, underworld,

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
erotic energy, and that was
sort of this darker energy.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And not dark as an evil,
but dark as in, like,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:84%
the loamy, rich, under-Earth,
where all the really great soil

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
is, like that kind of
Horned God kind of energy.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
showed up together

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
as twins, one
light and one dark.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they would show
up either one or the other.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that confused me because
I was like, is this two beings?

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Is this one being?

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to write
the dissertation--

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
to do the dissertation
kind of because

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that I was trying to
figure this out myself.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And being an academic, I thought
if I put my scholar hat on,

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.983 align:middle line:84%
and I look at this from
all across the globe,

00:10:39.983 --> 00:10:41.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe it'll help
me figure out how

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.675 align:middle line:90%
to figure out my own contact.

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did you
end up in a spirit

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:90%
marriage with this being?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yes.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So it took me about 10
years to really work

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:84%
through my own
preconceptions of what

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:84%
I had about the
underworld, about

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:84%
these deep, powerful,
potent beings.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to go
through some really

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.740 align:middle line:84%
decolonisation of
my own thinking

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:84%
as well as really understanding
the role, the role.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
had preconceptions--

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Sure.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --about what dark,
and loamy, and erotic meant.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Being raised Pentecostal,
those were no-nos.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Those are no-nos.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:23.965 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:23.965 --> 00:11:24.765 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: [CHUCKLES]

00:11:24.765 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did
you ultimately come

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:84%
to understand that it was
the full depth of one being?

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Mm-hmm.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was both
sides, both that were

00:11:33.655 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:90%
being brought to the table?

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:90%
So here's the interesting thing.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:84%
One of my teachers,
Craig Chalquist,

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
writes about our
own personal myth.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that came forward

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
was that I was in an experience,
or in a relationship,

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:84%
with these two beings
that are really one being,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.600 align:middle line:84%
but kind of like the Triple
Goddess, where she is her,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
but she has a few
different faces.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:84%
This being also had two
different faces, almost

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:84%
like a Janus character,
but more of this light

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of dark aspect.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you afraid
of the darker aspect?

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: There were
parts of me that were.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Like, intellectually
I got to the point

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
where I understood
what the role was.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But somatically, because
of all of that really

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
fundamentalist upbringing,
I had to really do

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:90%
some work around my--

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, that
dark, that underworld,

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:90%
it's all of our ancestors.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.190 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of it was about doing--

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and getting right
with my ancestors,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and doing ancestral
offerings and working

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:84%
to disentangle ancestral
karma, things like that.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is where--

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I should say that I began a
7-year initiation as a Faery

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Seership practitioner.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.915 align:middle line:84%
And that really helped me
because fairy world is all

00:12:47.915 --> 00:12:48.715 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:12:48.715 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's explain
that a little bit too.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Finish what you're saying and
then explain that to us a bit.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So I began my work as a
Faery Seership practitioner,

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:90%
apprenticing to Orion Foxwood.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's a 7-year-plus
apprenticeship where

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:84%
that's what we do, is we go into
the realms of the ancestors,

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and we go into the realms of
the fairy beings, which are--

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:84%
unlike what often is thought of
as, like, TinkerBell, sprite,

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that sort of Disneyana
version of a fairy being,

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
the fairy, as we sort of orient
around them with Faery Seership

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
is more of the ancient
primordial beings

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that came to this planet, helped
form and shape this planet,

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and then at some
point sort of receded.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's not unlike
JRR Tolkien's story

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:90%
of what happens with the elves.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
He, in fact, based his elf
characters on what we--

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:90%
what I refer to as fairy.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But they're very
similar in energy

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.050 align:middle line:90%
and in folkloric accounts.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this
apprenticeship really

00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:84%
helped me ground, disentangle,
and get really good and nice

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:90%
and rooted.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung says a
tree can only grow

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:90%
as high as the roots go deep.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: So I had to grow my
roots down really, really deep

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
to manage all of this shakti,
all of this potency energy

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you're
looking into an interfacing

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
with the Elemental
Kingdom, right?

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Mm-hmm.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, now,
how did that help you

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:84%
specifically on your
journey in your dream time?

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: It was
primarily in dreams,

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.100 align:middle line:84%
but then as I studied
and apprenticed,

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I developed other skills that
I could journey with and go

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
into journey and visual
states that helped me connect.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.655 align:middle line:84%
And also there's
tools and techniques

00:14:43.655 --> 00:14:45.655 align:middle line:84%
that we learned as Faery
Seership practitioners.

00:14:45.655 --> 00:14:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is this an
on-- for you, personally--

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:90%
an ongoing relationship, then?

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yes.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So, like I said, it
took me about 10 years

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:84%
to get to the point
where I really had

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:90%
a strong cosmological location.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And that was the point
where my contact, Gwyn,

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:84%
who is the Celtic or the Welsh
Lord of the fairy people,

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:84%
revealed himself to
me, like his name.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't uncommon in these
types of relationships, where

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.880 align:middle line:84%
we often go through
a time of testing

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:84%
or a time of really learning the
somatic nuances and the flavor

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:90%
of our contacts.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the name will
come right away, but often

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.580 align:middle line:84%
with the fairy people, it
comes quite a bit later

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
once you've demonstrated
a certain amount of trust

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and reliability.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So the interesting thing
about Gwyn is that--

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know this
before I received

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:90%
the name and the contact--

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
was that he actually has
a dark and a light face.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh,

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.797 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, yeah.

00:15:47.797 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: So a lot of
the folkloric accounts

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.968 align:middle line:84%
that I found later on verified
the experiential accounts I

00:15:52.968 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:90%
was having up until then.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.093 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, we're going
to-- in a little while,

00:15:56.093 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
what humans gain from this.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
from the other side,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle line:84%
from Gwyn's side, what are they
gaining from this experience

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:90%
with the human realm?

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: Yeah, well, they do
things that we can't, right?

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But we do lots of
things that they

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:84%
can't, like have a wonderful
embodied experience,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.395 align:middle line:84%
have an experience of art
and music and literature--

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Creativity.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: --creativity, exactly.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And we have wonderful
things we can taste

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and smell and touch
and experience.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And so-- in fact,
one of the women

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that I cite in my book is
married to a plant spirit,

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Ajo Sacha, which I
believe is wild garlic.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And she did a diet-- a
dieta-- with this plant,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:90%
and he married her.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, why would
you want to marry me?

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because the human
body is such a wonderful thing

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:90%
to experience.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a being
that has never been human,

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that is just this plant
spirit teacher that then

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.373 align:middle line:90%
wants to merge with this human.

00:17:04.373 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To have
that experience,

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
that five sense or more
beyond sense experience.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: And he said,
if you can just

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:16.319 align:middle line:84%
maintain a body that is
friendly to me, meaning not too

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
much toxins in her system,
then I can co-experience.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And then what she benefited
from was the wisdom

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.400 align:middle line:84%
that this plant spirit teacher
was willing and able to impart

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.340 align:middle line:90%
to her.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.098 align:middle line:84%
Before we go into more
of that-- because I also

00:17:33.098 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:84%
want to find out
things, you know,

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:84%
really practical
things like does this

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.717 align:middle line:84%
happen with people
who are already

00:17:37.717 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:90%
married to human people?

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Does this happen mostly
to single people?

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.715 align:middle line:84%
And, in your
experience, as you've

00:17:42.715 --> 00:17:44.340 align:middle line:84%
encountered many
through your research,

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.222 align:middle line:84%
of how this actually
works because I'm sure

00:17:46.222 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:90%
our audience will be curious.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, let's go into
the history of spirit marriage

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and what you dug up when you
were working on your thesis.

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And from around there,
just kind of hopscotch around

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:90%
the planet if that had--

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Sure, sure.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --shown up.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the earliest recorded
account that we have

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:84%
is in ancient Mesopotamia, so
the Sumerian sacred marriage.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And in this, the
priest or the priestess

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:90%
would marry the goddess Inanna.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And they would then
serve as her betrothed.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And there would be certain
rites that they performed.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the conversation
around the sacred marriage

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.420 align:middle line:90%
rituals--

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:84%
for academics, it's more, was
this just a visualized thing?

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Or was there two human proxies?

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to
offer that it actually

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:84%
was a royal sexual ritual where
the priest or the priestess

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
had a deep bonded intimate
relationship with the deity.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:90%
And we see evidence of this.

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you move into the Indic
traditions of North India

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and Nepal, you see
that spirit marriage

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
happens between a deity
or sometimes an Ishta Devi

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:84%
or Deva, which is
the chosen deity

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.800 align:middle line:84%
or kind of like the patron
saint of that practitioner.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But then sometimes you may
have your chosen deity,

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and then you may also have
a deity that you marry.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- that
example, I like

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
to think of kind of
like seasoning you.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're working with
your divine self, or your patron

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.942 align:middle line:84%
deity, that's like
your flavor already,

00:19:22.942 --> 00:19:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're just bringing
more of that flavor through.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But when you marry
a deity that is

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
maybe outside of
your regular ray

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
or your energy, your
seasoning, you're

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
bringing in something
that-- some skill,

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:84%
some tool that you didn't
even necessarily have before.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So that then is in
the Indian tradition,

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
it shows up in China as the
ghost marriage or the Ninshu.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was a fun
Netflix series that was out

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:90%
called "The Ghost Bride"--

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I wrote that down.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: --that was
all about that.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.125 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
anything about that.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: It was set
in Singapore, but--

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, now, I'll
have to check that out.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
That sounds quite
interesting, fun.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a whole
bunch of academic research

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.095 align:middle line:84%
about this Singapore
ghost bride marriages.

00:20:06.095 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some
of the other--

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Greece, this also--

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: Oh, well,
Greece, like, you know, I

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:14.320 align:middle line:84%
mean we hear more about the
Greeks sort of philandering

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:90%
with humans.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.620 align:middle line:84%
We don't hear as much about the
actual bonding and marriage.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.287 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't
make a commitment.

00:20:19.287 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: They didn't.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But I like-- I've relooked at
the myth of Cupid and Psyche.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think it actually is
a really shining example

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.870 align:middle line:90%
of a spirit marriage.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Because here we have
Psyche, who's a human woman.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And we have this sort of--

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.857 align:middle line:84%
to her, at least, this
unknown being, this spirit,

00:20:39.857 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:90%
this deity that's coming to her.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.780 align:middle line:90%
And she can't look at him.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:90%
She can't see his face.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's really, often,
what people go through

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.930 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning
unless they have

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
a very clearly defined
deity that appears to them

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.817 align:middle line:90%
and asks for marriage.

00:20:52.817 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's a period
of trying to figure out

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:84%
who you're talking to, which is
why discernment and discernment

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:90%
tools are so key.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're
going to get into that.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.463 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: But in the case of
Cupid, it took her a while.

00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And she had to go through
all of these trials.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And then she eventually
marries him, sees his radiance,

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and is herself transformed
by that marriage.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:90%
She's given immortality.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so also-- so
we have Africa, China, also

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Great Britain of people who
married fairy beings and such.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.215 align:middle line:84%
So the history of
this is global.

00:21:24.215 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: It's global.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's there
anthropologically.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:90%
It's there historically.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:84%
It's there in
spades in folklore.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And then also in
religion, the idea

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:38.792 align:middle line:84%
of virgin birth, which I
know you've talked with--

00:21:38.792 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Marguerite, mm-hmm.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Marguerite Rigoglioso.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Marguerite was actually
really instrumental

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:90%
in my early research.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.280 align:middle line:84%
She was on my
committee at one point.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And this idea that
Yashua, that Jesus,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.475 align:middle line:84%
was the offspring of
a human-deity union--

00:21:55.475 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: --and that that was
a kind of spirit marriage,

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.576 align:middle line:84%
or at least a kind
of spirit lover.

00:21:59.576 --> 00:22:01.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think we talked
about in our last interview,

00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:04.201 align:middle line:84%
yeah, and the nature of the
Marys as the vehicles for--

00:22:04.201 --> 00:22:05.159 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: So we see this.

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:07.160 align:middle line:10%
We see this even in
our Western traditions.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.700 align:middle line:10%
We just haven't really--

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.047 align:middle line:10%
nobody's really brought
all the threads together.

00:22:13.047 --> 00:22:14.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what I hope
this research does,

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
is it brings these
threads together

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and gets people from
disparate communities

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and disparate
experiences talking,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.438 align:middle line:84%
so that folks know that
it's not just them.

00:22:25.438 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:90%
They're not the only one.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the discernment part

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.102 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure some of
our audience will be saying,

00:22:32.102 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
well, how do you
know it's not just

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:84%
a rich imagination,
or a hallucination,

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:84%
or an entity and an issue
of possession, for example?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about the
discretion part of it.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:84%
So discernment really begins
with knowing thyself and really

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.645 align:middle line:84%
understanding, what are
my hot button issues?

00:22:56.645 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Like we talked about
and, like, my hot button

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:90%
issue around the underworld.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
certain amount of lifting

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:84%
one does psychologically
to really get right

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
with the spirits and to really
understand that we bring things

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.100 align:middle line:84%
to the relationship like we do
with any human relationship.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: I think what's most
important about understanding

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:84%
spirit marriage is it's just
like it's a relationship, just

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:84%
like any relationship,
whether it's

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.332 align:middle line:84%
a human or an
otherworldly being.

00:23:28.332 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Except who
leaves the toilet seat up,

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.542 align:middle line:90%
a little different issues.

00:23:31.542 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: You may not have
to-- different issues,

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:84%
but you still go through the
getting to know you phase.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's-- it's like
you would date a human.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I would hope that most
people wouldn't meet somebody

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.760 align:middle line:90%
and get married the next day.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a getting
to know you phase.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
cultivating the discernment.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
things that's most useful

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:84%
is having folks that
you can turn to,

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.050 align:middle line:84%
spiritual advisors or people
within your community,

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that understand
the nature of this,

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and then can really
help guide you.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
don't even necessarily

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:11.000 align:middle line:84%
need an entire spirit
marriage community around you

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:84%
if you just have a really good
spiritual advisor or somebody

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:90%
that can help guide you through.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things that kind of

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:84%
came out of most of
these traditions,

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:90%
is very few people go it alone.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Because in some cases,
in some traditions,

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:84%
the deity marriage is only
entered into if the deity is--

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:84%
or the spirit has appeared
to someone other than you--

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:90%
And so it's-- so you--

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: --and is like,
I want to marry them.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.603 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --so there's
some validation

00:24:40.603 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
that it's not your imagination,
and that would make sense.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Mm-hmm.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And Orion Foxwood, who is
my Faery Seership mentor,

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:84%
in his case, his mentor,
Dolores Ashcroft-Nowiki

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:84%
was in meditation, and
his soon-to-be spirit wife

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.410 align:middle line:84%
appeared to her, and said,
I want him to marry me.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:90%
And Orion's a gay man.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, why does this
fairy woman want to marry me?

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:84%
But there was a whole tradition,
the Faery Seership tradition,

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.390 align:middle line:90%
that was born out of that union.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.053 align:middle line:90%
And so she appeared to Dolores.

00:25:15.053 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And Dolores went to
Orion, and was like,

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.637 align:middle line:90%
you need to marry her.

00:25:17.637 --> 00:25:19.012 align:middle line:84%
And he was like,
oh, my goodness,

00:25:19.012 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:90%
is this like a shotgun wedding?

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.470 align:middle line:84%
But then he spent time--
he had known the spirit.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:84%
He had been working with this
spirit for a number of years.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.578 align:middle line:84%
But he just thought she was
this powerful, primordial being.

00:25:29.578 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't think he
was going to have to get--

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: Didn't think he was
going to have to commit.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.133 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that deep and
make a commitment, yeah.

00:25:34.133 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: But then a lot of
his books and teachings

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and practices have flown
out of their relationship.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think that discernment is
learning our inner hot-button

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:90%
issues and--

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.465 align:middle line:84%
as well as having validation
from a trusted advisor

00:25:53.465 --> 00:25:54.265 align:middle line:90%
or support person.

00:25:54.265 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I would think one of
the things coming up

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:01.470 align:middle line:84%
is, right now the energies
are very challenging for a lot

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.270 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.687 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are struggling

00:26:03.687 --> 00:26:05.240 align:middle line:90%
with human relationships.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And might there be a
temptation to not only want

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:14.870 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual union, but even
conjure a spiritual union

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:90%
through imagination and desire?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: That is
absolutely possible to do.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:84%
We read that in ceremonial
magic traditions, the conjuring

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:90%
of a familiar spirit.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
question that I would ask

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:90%
is, what is your outcome?

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.210 align:middle line:90%
What is your purpose for that?

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:39.065 align:middle line:84%
Is it for healing
and for a salve

00:26:39.065 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:84%
while you're lonely, or lost,
or frightened, or whatever?

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.770 align:middle line:84%
What I try to encourage
my students to do is,

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:52.880 align:middle line:84%
if they're not sure, if they're
sort of longing for something--

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and this is where the devotional
piece really comes in--

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:04.250 align:middle line:84%
is to find a deity, find
a divine loving presence

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:15.480 align:middle line:84%
that you feel safe
and held and loved by

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and that you can then
develop your relationship

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:90%
with that being.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So might
this be, say, beings

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:84%
that you've read about
in various traditions?

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Or what kind of being?

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Any type of being that
you resonate with strongly

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:90%
and feel safe with?

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: I think that for someone
who is looking to, as you were

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:84%
saying, sort of conjure
or manifest this kind

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:44.730 align:middle line:84%
of relationship, that starting
with a being that is sort

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
of known by a name and a
cosmological location that has

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe some characteristics
built up around them,

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.340 align:middle line:84%
already formulated
around that entity,

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:02.927 align:middle line:84%
is probably going to be a
little bit safer than just being

00:28:02.927 --> 00:28:05.010 align:middle line:84%
in sort of an open-- and
I'm saying because I went

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.330 align:middle line:90%
in the open--

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:90%
I kind of did it the hard way.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I said it took me so
long to constellate

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and around who my
contacts were or are.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's partly because
that going up beneath

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
is this really
ancient deity that

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:90%
is not widely acknowledged.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't
something I could have

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.020 align:middle line:84%
had an immediate identification
with, although I knew

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:84%
he was really connected to the
animals, and to the nature,

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and also to the horned, like the
horned beings, like Cernunnos

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.615 align:middle line:84%
or a Herne the Hunter
kind of energy.

00:28:40.615 --> 00:28:42.240 align:middle line:84%
But it took me a
while to get the name,

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.295 align:middle line:84%
so for folks that are wanting
to just jump in and begin

00:28:46.295 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:90%
a practice, I'd say--

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:48.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of
conjuring or creating.

00:28:48.065 --> 00:28:49.898 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: --yeah, start
manifesting something,

00:28:49.898 --> 00:28:52.230 align:middle line:84%
find a deity that
really turns you on.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Find a deity that you really
have that sense of longing

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:58.350 align:middle line:84%
towards because our
sacred longing is

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:01.256 align:middle line:90%
like the key to this practice.

00:29:01.256 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And doesn't that
exist in most human beings?

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.960 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know how to engage
with one another on that level.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.052 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of so many
filters, so many programs,

00:29:11.052 --> 00:29:12.760 align:middle line:84%
so much trauma to
the human species.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, to your question about
folks that are in relationship

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.910 align:middle line:84%
or not in relationship, I see
across the board people who

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:27.180 align:middle line:84%
are single and called
into these, people

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:84%
who are in existing
relationships

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and are called into
a spirit marriage.

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It helps if your partner
is either in the tradition

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that you're working
in or understands

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:90%
somewhat of what's going on.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Because it ends up
being a negotiation,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.280 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a polyamorous
relationship, where you're

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.490 align:middle line:84%
having to negotiate
anywhere from one

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.665 align:middle line:84%
night a month to
three nights a week,

00:29:52.665 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:90%
depending on the tradition.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if it's
happening during dream time--

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Well, there's--

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --a lot of the time.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: A lot of
the time it can.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the only way
that people experience this.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Some people have--

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.620 align:middle line:84%
I've just always had
very, very strong dreams

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and precognitive kinds
of prophetic dreams.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's been mostly
one of my main areas.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Plus, it's where I can turn-- my
academic brain gets turned off

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.480 align:middle line:84%
so that I have to just
go with whatever shows up

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:90%
and not analyze it to death.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a negotiation
like, as you say,

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:84%
even if it was
another human being.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.713 align:middle line:84%
And I would imagine
that there are

00:30:29.713 --> 00:30:31.380 align:middle line:84%
people that become
very threatened by it

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.150 align:middle line:84%
if the quality of
that relationship

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:84%
is really drawing
their partner in.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So these are just some
of the practical issues.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.110 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion that
what we're being drawn into

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.300 align:middle line:84%
might also be an
aspect of ourselves?

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.878 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that's
what's wonderful

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:55.700 align:middle line:84%
about the constellation
or the fractal that

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.820 align:middle line:84%
is the human consciousness,
that's the human psyche.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we have our sort
of localized human psyche

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.510 align:middle line:90%
that is our mundane self.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
our higher self.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And then in
ceremonial traditions,

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the
holy guardian angel

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.995 align:middle line:84%
that sits sort of above even our
higher self or our wise self,

00:31:15.995 --> 00:31:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of like a
patron deity or patron saint.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And the way I think of it
is, we're the fingertip on--

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:32.200 align:middle line:84%
that is touching into the
physical, that is expressing

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.140 align:middle line:90%
the body of the deity.

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:90%
And that is our incarnated--

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.660 align:middle line:90%
we can push matter around.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Like, they can't.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all
nested back here.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But another fingertip
might be another person.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And--

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: And so in the
idea of spirit marriage,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:57.370 align:middle line:84%
we can both marry our
divine self, and that

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:58.630 align:middle line:90%
could be our spirit spouse.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.713 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
kind of what I'm wondering.

00:32:00.713 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:84%
It gets to the subject
of a twin souls,

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.040 align:middle line:90%
for example, where perhaps you--

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in different
traditions, you start as one.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
You split apart into
male/female rays.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.140 align:middle line:84%
You have your experience
throughout incarnation.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you connect
in the physical world

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.207 align:middle line:90%
in some kind of relationship.

00:32:20.207 --> 00:32:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But for many of these
times you don't.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
There's lifetimes you're not
connected with that being,

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.210 align:middle line:90%
that other part of yourself.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And so is it possible that
some of these spirit unions

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.740 align:middle line:84%
are you and say your twin
self, your twin flame?

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that that is one of
the ways that these show up.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
sometimes we incarnate

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.740 align:middle line:84%
with a twin soul or a soul
mate at the same time.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.447 align:middle line:84%
And then I think sometimes
they're in the spiritual

00:32:45.447 --> 00:32:46.530 align:middle line:90%
and we're in the physical.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm referring to.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: And then sometimes we're
both in the spiritual together.

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we might be
part of the monad

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:57.430 align:middle line:84%
of a particular ray of creation,
or a deity, or an archetype.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And then that splits, and
splits, and splits, and splits,

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:02.260 align:middle line:90%
and we have soul families.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we may
have another split

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.410 align:middle line:90%
where we're the twin soul.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And that we,
oftentimes-- and this

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.537 align:middle line:84%
has shown up in many
of my co-researchers,

00:33:10.537 --> 00:33:12.370 align:middle line:84%
so we haven't talked
as much about the folks

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.800 align:middle line:84%
that I talked to
when I wrote my book.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But I interviewed nine
different practitioners

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:22.660 align:middle line:84%
from seven different traditions,
widely disparate traditions,

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.300 align:middle line:84%
everywhere from African
traditional religion

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:30.280 align:middle line:90%
to Faery Seership to witchcraft.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And they all-- these were
very high-level ministers,

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:84%
spiritual people,
in their tradition

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:90%
that had spirit marriages.

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:43.065 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
threads in that is

00:33:43.065 --> 00:33:44.440 align:middle line:84%
that they felt
like that they had

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.680 align:middle line:84%
been married to the
spirit being lifetime

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.930 align:middle line:90%
after lifetime after lifetime.

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:49.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm wondering
about, and that's

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.036 align:middle line:90%
why I asked that question.

00:33:51.036 --> 00:33:52.203 align:middle line:90%
And we are multidimensional.

00:33:52.203 --> 00:33:53.003 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Exactly.

00:33:53.003 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have
to remember-- yeah,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.083 align:middle line:84%
it's natural for us to be
able to reach into other

00:33:57.083 --> 00:33:57.883 align:middle line:90%
dimensions--

00:33:57.883 --> 00:33:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and to connect
with other beings including

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:01.710 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's-- OK, let's
get practical now.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you want, you can
give an example of it.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Like, when is it appropriate?

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.179 align:middle line:84%
And under what conditions
and what kind of person

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:16.140 align:middle line:84%
is really most successful
in this endeavor?

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the kind
of person is anyone.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.170 align:middle line:84%
We all have a divine self
that we can fall in love with.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:84%
We all have a
divine self that we

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:32.020 align:middle line:84%
can aspire to bring more
of that energy into who

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.532 align:middle line:90%
and what we do in the world.

00:34:34.532 --> 00:34:35.949 align:middle line:84%
So you can marry
your divine self.

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.199 align:middle line:84%
You can also just sort of
embody your divine self.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a fine line, but I've
interviewed a Shakta Tantric

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.210 align:middle line:84%
who is both married
to the goddess Kali,

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.070 align:middle line:90%
and Kali is also her Ishta Devi.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:49.699 align:middle line:84%
So-- and some traditions,
they kind of don't do that.

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But it is-- there
is precedent for it.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So we all have a divine
self we can reach to.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, also,
if the spirit has

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:84%
been asking you to
marry them, it's

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.490 align:middle line:84%
a good idea to
follow that thread.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a good idea to
follow through with that.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
you have to marry them,

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.080 align:middle line:84%
but you want to
get to know them.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.900 align:middle line:90%
You want to understand why.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.000 align:middle line:90%
And what would be the purpose?

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things that I think

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:19.060 align:middle line:84%
is really powerful about
spirit marriages is they--

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:22.990 align:middle line:84%
versus just sort of being
in a contracted channeling

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:84%
agreement or a kind of
possessory, where it comes in

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes out, or comes
forward and then proceeds

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:90%
back--

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.360 align:middle line:84%
is that the spirit
marriage is, by and large,

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.190 align:middle line:90%
from my research--

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:84%
they happen because
that there's some sort

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:43.780 align:middle line:84%
of co-creative project that
only you and your spirit beloved

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:90%
can do.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And the intimacy of
that, the union--

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.700 align:middle line:84%
what's called the indwelling
or the merging of those two

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.850 align:middle line:84%
beings-- creates a third
being or a love child.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:56.470 align:middle line:90%
In my case, it's this research.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:02.560 align:middle line:84%
It's this book that was the love
child of my union with Gwyn.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is because
that the time is right.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:84%
This research needs to get
out as we're moving towards,

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, evolving our
consciousness as a species.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the ways
that this can happen,

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.835 align:middle line:84%
these co-creative projects
with our spirit beloveds.

00:36:22.835 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of
the things you say

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.960 align:middle line:84%
is that this can really
help us advance ourselves

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.180 align:middle line:84%
by having this
kind of commitment

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.850 align:middle line:84%
with someone in another
dimension, another being,

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.350 align:middle line:90%
a non-Earth being.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:38.340 align:middle line:84%
In what ways-- you just talked
about your book, but maybe

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.210 align:middle line:84%
an anecdote or two of some other
people you know of and the ways

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.767 align:middle line:84%
it's enhanced their Earth
experience, their lives,

00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:45.600 align:middle line:90%
their understanding.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Yeah.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.450 align:middle line:84%
One of my co-researchers,
Caroline Kenner,

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:55.650 align:middle line:84%
is both a witchcraft
practitioner--

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and she works in a few
different traditions--

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and was trained to do
shamanistic-type work.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.880 align:middle line:90%
And her spirit beloved--

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.678 align:middle line:84%
she actually is an
interesting example

00:37:07.678 --> 00:37:09.720 align:middle line:84%
because she's married to
a few different-- so she

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.740 align:middle line:84%
has a sort of, by the nature
of her many spirit marriages,

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.520 align:middle line:84%
is in this sort of
interesting polyamorous

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:90%
relationship with the spirits.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And they really enhance
her gifts and her ability

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:84%
to do extraction work for folks,
to journey for people, to do--

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.500 align:middle line:90%
to help with healing.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's a pretty typical
gift that comes from the gifts

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:43.140 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit, is the ability
to bless, the ability to heal,

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.200 align:middle line:84%
the pre-cognisance to be
able to see things that--

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.985 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To remove
interfering energies?

00:37:47.985 --> 00:37:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Mm-hmm.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Cleansing work, disentangling
work, all of that really comes,

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's such a
psycho-emotional,

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:59.370 align:middle line:84%
like a subtle body
shift that happens.

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:05.662 align:middle line:84%
But it also is known to give the
gift of prophecy, of eloquence,

00:38:05.662 --> 00:38:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and these particularly
are associated with some

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.150 align:middle line:90%
of the fairy traditions.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But you hear about Thomas the
Rhymer, wed the fairy Queen

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and was given this gift
of prophecy and also

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.520 align:middle line:90%
beautiful poetics.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And he's an actual
historical figure.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Thomas of Ercildoun, who
is a Scottish laird that

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.420 align:middle line:84%
married this fairy woman and
was a man of really well renown

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and standing that we still
have writings from to this day.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.320 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that kind
of inspiration coming in

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.440 align:middle line:90%
through the other side.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the practical notion

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.940 align:middle line:84%
of protocols or precautions,
a cautionary tale.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: Well, I mean
the cautionary tales,

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.073 align:middle line:84%
I think, happen
when they're rushed,

00:38:52.073 --> 00:38:53.490 align:middle line:84%
when the relationships
are rushed,

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and you really don't have the
support around you to discern.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What can happen?

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:00.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:03.157 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: Well, I mean, we're
moving a little bit more

00:39:03.157 --> 00:39:04.680 align:middle line:84%
into just spirit
communication here

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:11.430 align:middle line:84%
because once you've gotten to
the marriage, you've said, yes.

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.980 align:middle line:84%
In many traditions, they
say they can't be undone.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.780 align:middle line:84%
However, I will
tell you that I do

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.620 align:middle line:84%
know of an instance of someone
who got into a marriage,

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.150 align:middle line:84%
didn't like how things were
going, and divorced them.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
that hold these

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.690 align:middle line:84%
say that they're entwined
for the rest of your life.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:31.678 align:middle line:84%
But I think that has to
do more with the cosmology

00:39:31.678 --> 00:39:32.970 align:middle line:90%
of the spirit that you're with.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.170 align:middle line:90%
So like with fairy beings--

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:38.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's such a long
and labored process to merge

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.400 align:middle line:84%
and mingle with them in
that way to end well--

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that it is kind of like,
you just get grafted together.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.190 align:middle line:84%
But in other traditions,
you can divorce.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So divorce isn't out of
the-- it's not off the table.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:56.850 align:middle line:84%
But you want to really be able
to have a community around you

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that can uphold and support
you and is sort of your check

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and balance, like any
spiritual community,

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.790 align:middle line:90%
healthy spiritual community.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Now can you-- and we just
have a few minutes left.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine living your life
without your spiritual marriage

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.042 align:middle line:90%
partner?

00:40:16.042 --> 00:40:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSE: Given that I--

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:84%
the more I feel into that
relationship, the more I think

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.235 align:middle line:84%
he's been with me
my whole life--

00:40:22.235 --> 00:40:23.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
other lifetimes.

00:40:23.735 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: --and lifetimes
before, I can't imagine.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that it would be
like the loss of a limb,

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:90%
like only part of me is here.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
all have the capacity

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:41.240 align:middle line:84%
for this type of union, for
this type of deep bonded

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.920 align:middle line:90%
relationship with spirit.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Even if you start with
your divine self, that

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.570 align:middle line:84%
rarefied aspect
of you, that often

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:52.980 align:middle line:90%
will bring in other seasoning.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, is it sometimes
not maybe an issue

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.560 align:middle line:84%
of coming into a collaboration
or ultimately a marriage

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.410 align:middle line:84%
with a spirit
guide, for example?

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSE: That's absolutely
possible, yeah,

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:09.710 align:middle line:84%
because one of the things that
I think my research uncovered

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:14.325 align:middle line:84%
that's really exciting
is that people are--

00:41:14.325 --> 00:41:15.950 align:middle line:84%
particularly here in
the United States,

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:middle line:84%
people enter into
spirit marriages

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:23.960 align:middle line:84%
with beloved dead and sort
of elevated beloved dead, not

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Aunt Matilda.

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:25.850 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.190 align:middle line:90%
But it is--

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- want to say it's
a uniquely American phenomenon,

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:34.970 align:middle line:84%
although I have heard about
this marriage with beloved dead

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.770 align:middle line:84%
or elevated beloved dead mostly
from American practitioners.

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's kind
of indicative of how

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.970 align:middle line:84%
we have such a pastiche
of different cultures

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and different traditions
here, that there isn't

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:50.300 align:middle line:84%
just one pantheon
that-- or one group

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.240 align:middle line:90%
that folks are working with.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In summary, it
seems like what this also

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:84%
does is it brings a
re-enchantment to life

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:02.900 align:middle line:84%
in a world that feels as though
it's become too mechanical, too

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.460 align:middle line:90%
doctrinaire, dogmatic.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And people are feeling
a loss of energy

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.320 align:middle line:90%
and too many control systems.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
this is a way to be

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:84%
able to move beyond that into
that enchanted aspect of self

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:16.670 align:middle line:90%
again.

Yeah.

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that the re-enchantment
of the world is our--

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:25.280 align:middle line:84%
that and our own conscious
evolution as a species

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.440 align:middle line:84%
are the two things that
will save us as a planet.

Any final thoughts
before we sign off?

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.030 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSE: I would just say that,
by and large, the spirits that

for thought there.

And not only that, we have to
realize we don't necessarily--

if we're not inclined to
say, I want to go all the way

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.772 align:middle line:84%
into this thing and make
a commitment, we have to--

it just opens up to
the notion that we're

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.020 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by so many entities,
so much love, so much support.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.330 align:middle line:84%
We can enter into a BFF
relationship, with someones.

lots of different ways in which

So it doesn't have
to be marriage.

>>REGINA: So just
know that this world

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:27.305 align:middle line:84%
is here around us and
whispering and speaking

00:43:27.305 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:90%
to us all of the time.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:29.480 align:middle line:90%
And be discerning.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:29.945 align:middle line:90%
Be aware.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:31.040 align:middle line:90%

some food for thought here.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
an intriguing idea

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.750 align:middle line:84%
to bring back the
notion of our connection

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:84%
with not only our higher
selves, our ancestors,

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and beings from beyond, and
they can look or show up

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.190 align:middle line:84%
as anything, really, but
to reengage with the unseen
