00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
There was a quote

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.840 align:middle line:10%
by Mahatma Gandhi that read,
"The greatness of a nation

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.290 align:middle line:10%
can be judged by the way
the animals are treated."

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And this speaks to
me, as our treatment

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:84%
of those who can't
speak for themselves

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:84%
is the degree of our
civility and compassion.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Linda Bender has
spent her lifetime

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:84%
communicating with and
learning from animals,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and she's here to
teach us about how

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.940 align:middle line:84%
we can start going into
better union with them

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
by her new book,
"Animal Wisdom."

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Linda.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you again.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your book
is finally out there.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.707 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't out last
time we spoke.

00:00:59.707 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so for people who
didn't see our first interview,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:84%
let's go back--
way, way, way back.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm regressing you
back to the age of six,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:90%
when your story really began.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.694 align:middle line:84%
So please tell us
about what happened

00:01:11.694 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:90%
when you were six years old.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Because you like animals
better than people,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.709 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to get your
mind around liking people

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:90%
as much as animals.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.794 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:19.794 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: I'm getting there.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:10%
It's all a process.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.140 align:middle line:10%
But I was asked once
after a lecture--

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:10%
I've been teaching about
the sacred relationship

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:10%
between humans and
animals for a long time.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:10%
And I was asked once, when
did your relationship begin?

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about it and
I really could not remember.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So upon contemplating that,
I thought back to a time

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:90%
when I was about six.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was awakened in my
sleep, at my parents' home,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:90%
by the sound of screaming.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:90%
So we got up, got a flashlight.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:90%
We went outside.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And there, quivering on the
second tier of our lawn,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:90%
was a tiny bunny.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:90%
And obviously--

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and those
screams are human.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Oh, it was curdling.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So mom wasn't around
and this little creature

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:84%
had obviously had some mishap
with another, larger being.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So I scooped up
that little bunny,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.246 align:middle line:84%
and brought it inside, and
decided this was my job.

00:02:30.246 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I was going to take
care of this bunny.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:90%
I was going to save this bunny.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So I put the bunny
here on my chest,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and we lied down on my
parents' kitchen floor.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.375 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm going
to stay awake all night

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to hold
this bunny because it's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
going to hear my breathing
and feel my heartbeat.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to
me at that moment--

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and I have a
distinct recollection

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:84%
of feeling great love,
really for the first time

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:90%
in my young life.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And it swirled around me,
encompassing me and that bunny.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
there was something

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
going on here very strong,
bigger than both of us.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand it, but I
knew that rescuing that bunny

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:84%
gave a meaning to
my little life.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And thus began a very
deep and strong bond

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.067 align:middle line:90%
between me and animals.

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did the bunny make it?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.358 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: The bunny was
with me in the morning.

00:03:30.358 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I said I wasn't
going to fall asleep,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:90%
which of course I did.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.473 align:middle line:84%
But it was still
here in the morning.

00:03:38.473 --> 00:03:39.056 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:41.057 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: And it made
it and we released it.

00:03:41.057 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.864 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: So--

00:03:43.864 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
one of the things

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I-- On a spiritual level--
and I know that-- I've

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:90%
interviewed people about this.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I've looked into
the subject a lot--

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
that I still don't
understand, which is--

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk about
a little later-- the nature

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
of the predatory aspect
of the animal kingdom.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I live in the desert, and
I cannot stand it at night.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I have to wear earplugs all the
time because the coyotes are

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.223 align:middle line:90%
killing the bunnies.

00:04:09.223 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And the screams at night--
it just is devastating,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:90%
like, what is the sense in that?

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.516 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:16.016 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've had you've
had some communication there,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:90%
to explain that.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.151 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: I have.

00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And humans really have
a misunderstanding

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:84%
about the prey-predator
relationship.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's just go-- we

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
were going to talk
about it a little later.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Just go there now, and we'll
then get into the rest of it.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.952 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Sure.

00:04:33.952 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And I do address
this in the book

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
because I've spent a great deal
of time working in the trenches

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:84%
with wildlife, and even as
a kid, as you're saying,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.760 align:middle line:90%
out understanding.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:90%
And I agree.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:90%
It's difficult.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But the prey-predator
relationship is a mystery.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:84%
None of us-- no one knows why
prey-predator relationship

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And even as humans,
we are animals.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:84%
We forget that
we're animals too.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.195 align:middle line:84%
And we're also part of the
prey-predator relationship.

00:05:08.195 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Except that what
we do to our prey animals,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.134 align:middle line:84%
we now hide behind closed doors
because-- that's another issue,

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and we can discuss
it if you would like.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.883 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would like to.

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: And it's a
deep concern of mine,

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:90%
how we treat our prey animals.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what
has the animal kingdom

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
relayed to you, in
the larger field,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of that
predator-prey relationship?

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to hear
about this cloaked interface

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:90%
humanity has.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Well, what I
have learned and observed--

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:84%
I've been in Africa, and
I have watched and seen

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:90%
prey-predator relationship.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And I have I have watched
lions, for example-- how they

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.680 align:middle line:90%
treat their prey, what they do.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding, and my
observations, and many others--

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:90%
it's a sacred exchange.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:90%
It is not taking.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:90%
It is giving and receiving.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a distinction
there between the grabbing

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and taking and
mutilating as opposed

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to the sacred bond of, all life
dies to give other life, life.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.680 align:middle line:90%
It's all a dying and a rebirth.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is the relationship.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And there is a sacred bond
between a prey and a predator.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:84%
For example in the lions,
they kill their prey.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And they share that prey
and they stay with it.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:90%
They stay with it.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:90%
They share it.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.520 align:middle line:90%
They honor it.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And to observe it, you
are pulled into the more

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:90%
sacred aspect of it.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Granted, it's not something
we enjoy watching.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:90%
All life wants to stay alive.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: All animals
want to survive.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
But they are-- let
me say that animals

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
exist in a reality that is more
closely connected to source.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that, but
I think where I get hung up,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.650 align:middle line:84%
on an energetic level, is
that there is virtually always

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.327 align:middle line:84%
a massive amount of fear
involved in the process.

00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One or the other is
going to experience great fear.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've always--
I think part of me

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:84%
wonders why fear has to
be part of this process.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.204 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
protect your life,

00:07:39.204 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be afraid
of losing your life.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're a fish, you're going
to struggle against the line.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.924 align:middle line:84%
If you're a bunny--
well, I understand

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:46.840 align:middle line:90%
bunnies are different.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.140 align:middle line:84%
They actually scream
and actually lose

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, is what I've
understood, before they're

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.314 align:middle line:90%
aware of being torn.

00:07:54.314 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.481 align:middle line:90%
And studies have shown--

00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:57.938 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
there's a grace

00:07:57.938 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:90%
after the fear in all of this.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:07:59.825 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yeah.

00:07:59.825 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And even with humans--
they say humans

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:84%
who've experienced extreme
trauma and they've survived,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.035 align:middle line:84%
they say that there is a certain
shutdown-- that the body takes

00:08:10.035 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:90%
care of itself.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But in that world
where animals exist,

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:84%
where they are more closely
connected to source,

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and they understand
more the prey-predator

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:84%
give and receive-- still,
if that was just OK,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.290 align:middle line:84%
then they'd all roll
over belly up instead

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:90%
of fighting to exist.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:90%
Fear is important.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Fear kicks in the
fight or flight.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:90%
We all want to stay alive.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
All creatures want
to stay alive.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:46.269 align:middle line:84%
But when they know
their time is over, it--

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
a sense of knowing.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: There is a sense.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And same with
human beings-- car accidents.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.530 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're jettisoned
out of the body.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
There's fear right
before, perhaps,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and a primal aspect of
the being, the emotions,

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And then there's no
real connection anymore.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: But I really
think that humans,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.880 align:middle line:84%
before we look down on the
prey-predator relationship

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.435 align:middle line:90%
in the wild--

00:09:08.435 --> 00:09:10.018 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need
to look at our part.

00:09:10.018 --> 00:09:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: We need to look
at what we are doing.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And now, there are,
I believe, 19 states

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
who've made it against the
law to go to slaughterhouses

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:90%
and take film-- footage.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Paul McCartney once said if
slaughterhouses had glass

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.629 align:middle line:90%
walls, no one would eat meat.

00:09:33.629 --> 00:09:34.212 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:34.212 --> 00:09:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: The
industry-- I've been

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:84%
saying for many, many
years-- more than I want

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:90%
to think about-- it's not good.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's worse.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
It's something that really
needs to be addressed.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Completely inhumane.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:48.465 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: It's
completely inhumane.

00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
not just that.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It's also-- I did an
interview in England

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:84%
recently with Lady
Tracy Worcester

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.780 align:middle line:90%
on the subject of pig farming.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And someone did manage to
get into one of those housing

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:90%
projects for pigs.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.249 align:middle line:90%
It was so depressing.

00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
It was hard to even
do the interview.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's even
while they're living.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the killing.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.312 align:middle line:84%
It's the way they're
treated in life.

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Oh, no.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the problem.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And with pigs, they're
not called pigs.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
They're called units,
because how else could we do

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:90%
what we do to those creatures?

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.889 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially
knowing their intelligence.

00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: And feel
pain and feel fear.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Their lives are miserable.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.134 align:middle line:90%
So-- yeah.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
so we really-- I

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.674 align:middle line:84%
mean, part of this
conversation-- this

00:10:37.674 --> 00:10:39.840 align:middle line:84%
isn't where I was going to
go with it at this point,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:90%
but we're here.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Exactly.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so part
of it really comes down

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:90%
to our own self responsibility.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not a matter of
whether a person wants

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:90%
to be a vegan or primal.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of the
consciousness with which

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:84%
the various food sources--
animal, protein, or otherwise--

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
are raised, and that
includes plants.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Exactly.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it isn't
that we eat meat.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I do, of course, recommend
a vegetarian diet.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I've been a vegetarian for
many years and vegan, as well.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:19.570 align:middle line:84%
But with our population
and-- it's unsustainable

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:84%
to continue to eat
meat, the way we

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:84%
are eating meat,
in any humane way.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the way it's being done.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know-- I mean,
those are decisions

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.890 align:middle line:84%
I had to make as a
20-year vegetarian who

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
had to go back to animal
protein for health purposes

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:84%
because I was only a vegetarian
for spiritual purposes for all

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:90%
those years-- two decades.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And you have to really
do your homework

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and you have to find
the local farmer who

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
raises their animals--
they're pasture grazed.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to know
their name necessarily,

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:84%
but it's really good--
for anybody watching this,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.120 align:middle line:84%
you can find this
at farmers markets

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
where people are now

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:84%
bringing the animals
that they raise in,

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.360 align:middle line:84%
where they'll do--
usually in this case,

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
of the one in the little
country town I was in,

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
they would literally
shoot them while they

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
were grazing-- just a swift
shot, and that was done.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.204 align:middle line:84%
So the fear didn't have
a chance to set in.

00:12:15.204 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
even ugly as that is,

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.854 align:middle line:84%
it's still more humane than
what you're talking about.

00:12:23.854 --> 00:12:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, I
talk about this.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the reciprocity
of our relationship.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:37.170 align:middle line:84%
What we do to animals,
we do to ourselves.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:90%
That is nature.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:90%
That is life.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And so when we eat the
flesh of an animal that

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.040 align:middle line:84%
has been pumped full of
hormones and antibiotics

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and whose body is
riddled with toxins,

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%
stress hormones--
all of this-- and we

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
eat the flesh of that animal,
that becomes part of our body.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.939 align:middle line:90%
And that is not my opinion.

00:13:04.939 --> 00:13:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
very concentrated.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.396 align:middle line:84%
I mean, granted, we're
eating all that garbage

00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:11.850 align:middle line:84%
in the plant kingdom too,
to say nothing of GMOs.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:84%
But then you can condense
it through the process

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:84%
of making it into
flesh, and you're

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.680 align:middle line:84%
talking about highly
concentrated levels

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: So it's physiology.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.810 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just that
I am responding

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.900 align:middle line:84%
to the cruelty of animals,
which we are, and I am.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's truly-- it's
the way it has to be.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
What's in that animal's body
becomes a part of our body

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:90%
when we ingest it.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's a joyful
corollary to that, as well.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
When we take care
of animals, we're

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.770 align:middle line:90%
also taking care of ourselves.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:84%
When we walk our dogs
and give them exercise,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:90%
we're also getting exercise.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So the reciprocity
works both ways.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And you mention in your
book that it's good for us

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to be reminded of the word
"animal" and the source

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
of the word-- the original
root of the word "animal"

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:84%
to begin our relationship
with this subject

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.247 align:middle line:90%
and these wonderful beings.

00:14:06.247 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:84%
The root word of "animal,"
"anima," means "soul."

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:90%
All life has soul.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I was doing an interview
with Deepak Chopra,

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and he said, where do
you draw the line, Linda?

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Where do you draw
the line with animals

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:90%
having souls or whatever?

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.190 align:middle line:90%
All life is soul.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back to
the indigenous cultures,

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.430 align:middle line:90%
this is an accepted fact.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:90%
All life is soul.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.760 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be otherwise,
in my experience.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I
would agree with you.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are people-- I
was having a conversation

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:90%
with someone recently, in fact.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
the notion of animals

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
having these spiritual
bonds with humans

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and coming back because they
live such short lifespans

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
compared to our own and even
coming back within a lifetime

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.820 align:middle line:90%
to be with an owner again.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's something many
people find intriguing.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I've had what I think is
that exact experience.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.934 align:middle line:84%
And talk about it
from your perspective

00:15:11.934 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and your own thoughts on it.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.725 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yeah.

00:15:13.725 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, I hear this so much.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:10%
And since I've been on my book
tour, I hear it even more.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:10%
And I have a whole chapter
in the book that talks

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.120 align:middle line:10%
about dying-- death and dying.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And animals, because of
their shorter life spans,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
are often our first
experience with dying.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: And in all age
groups-- with children,

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:90%
with adults, with the elderly.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:90%
So they help us.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:90%
They help.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Animals can be like a
bridge to the unknown.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And they, again,
live in a place--

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
they exist in a world-- that
is more connected to source.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:90%
So they are more trusting.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And while they are alive, even
though things don't necessarily

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
always go well in their lives,
as we know, they still trust.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes toward the
end of life, in my experience,

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:84%
animals are more
comfortable with dying

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.675 align:middle line:90%
because they trust life.

00:16:18.675 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't have-- I mean,
in the natural process,

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:84%
there's not a big fear
of it as they age--

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:90%
only if they're being hunted.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And so if they trust
everything that

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.740 align:middle line:84%
happens in life, because
it's part of source,

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:84%
then why would they not continue
to trust what will happen

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:90%
after they leave this realm?

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And that is what I have seen.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And on so many
occasions, animals--

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and in my life and career,
I've had many animals

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:84%
die in my arms-- what
they've taught me about death

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.800 align:middle line:90%
and dying is just amazing.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And I try to pass
that on to people.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:84%
The whole connection
to the other realms

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
they have that we have lost,
I find really interesting.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:84%
They have an awareness of the
finer frequencies around them

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:84%
that humans lost
a long time ago.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about,
not only are they

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%
here to help us learn
joy, but perhaps--

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like you to
discuss that a bit--

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:84%
but also, perhaps they can help
us learn to find our way back

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
to our own instincts
a little bit.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I watch my little
Bichon and she's

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
watching everything
going on-- and I've

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:84%
had it corroborated
with people--

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.227 align:middle line:84%
and she's just looking
at spooks all the time.

00:17:37.227 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, there's
that connection

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:84%
that we have closed down in
our contemporary culture.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's very easy
to get it back,

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and I try to help
people do that.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And people often
say to me, I want

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.430 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with my dog.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Are you an animal communicator?

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And I say, let's look at the
life of St. Francis of Assisi.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
He was deeply connected
to his intuitive

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.020 align:middle line:90%
being-- to his spiritual being.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So the whole package includes
communicating with animals--

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.515 align:middle line:84%
not only animals but trees
and plants and all beings--

00:18:12.515 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All life.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: --all life.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.958 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
about the joy part?

00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I know that you feel
very strongly that that's

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.520 align:middle line:84%
part of their
position in our lives

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.134 align:middle line:84%
is to help us find
our own joy again.

00:18:24.134 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Right because
we're miserable.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.360 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.460 align:middle line:84%
As a lot-- we're a
pretty miserable lot.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: We're a lot miserable.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yeah.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the
deep connection

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.870 align:middle line:84%
that they teach us
about love, they

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:90%
teach us the joy of aliveness.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.650 align:middle line:84%
That's my Linda-ism--
the joy of aliveness.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine on Monday
morning, we're getting ready.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:84%
We've got our to do list, and
we're dashing out the door.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we hear
a voice-- something--

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:90%
a sweet melody up in the tree.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And for one moment, we're
seduced by that gorgeous melody

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
from the bird in
the tree singing out

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:90%
the joy of just being alive.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's one of my
favorite meditations, actually,

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.810 align:middle line:84%
is in the morning,
to sit very quietly

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and then allow my
auditory perceptions

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to expand beyond my
normal auditory range.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And it starts with the birds--
all the different birds

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:90%
around the house.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you go expand,
and touch with that,

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and bring that energy back
in, not only is it sublime,

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:90%
it's extremely powerful.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: It's very
powerful and it also

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
does some-- it does two
things that are very

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.820 align:middle line:90%
important to our reconnecting.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And number one,
we're immediately

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
connected to that
joy of aliveness.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:48.710 align:middle line:84%
But that also pulls us
into the present moment

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:84%
because in the present
moment-- as animals well know

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and where animals live-- is
the only time anything ever

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the only time
anything ever happens,

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:90%
is in the present moment.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: And we are so
often stuck in the past

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:90%
or worrying about the future.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So animals can
help us-- bring us

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.520 align:middle line:84%
into the moment where we
can actually, for a moment,

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:90%
focus on being alive and living.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And part of that
is the only-- as you say,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
they don't have a
vertical access to source.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
They're simply in the now,
in the midst of, and blended

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.380 align:middle line:84%
with source all the time--
a different kind of soul

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.120 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: It is
very-- it's different.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And I can give you, from my
own personal experience--

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:84%
again, when I was a child--
children are much more open.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:90%
They don't question.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a
child, I remember

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:90%
listening to the birds.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And the birds-- all I can
say is they invited me

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:90%
into their world.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was a scrawny,
funny little kid.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
My dad called me nature girl,
and I was always out there

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.440 align:middle line:90%
with the critters.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And they-- almost what
we would call today

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.910 align:middle line:90%
an inter-species adoption.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Here was this little
thing looking for love

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't getting a whole
lot of, necessarily, indoors.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the human world.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: So there I was.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:90%
And they pulled me in.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
going into something

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I knew nothing of
what was happening,

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:84%
but it was more like
a meditative state--

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:90%
being invited into their world.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And there, you lose a sense
of time and the separateness.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were in
their realm of the now.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: I was in
their consciousness.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So it is truly a
different frequency.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.247 align:middle line:90%
It is a consciousness.

00:21:45.247 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what were
the qualities of it?

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:84%
What it does feel like, besides
the timeless aspect of it?

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.466 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Well, I'll
tell you exactly.

00:21:53.466 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is what
sparked my lifelong interest

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:90%
in spirituality.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And I would say about eight
years ago, I was in California,

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and I was participating
in this meditation group,

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and we were doing some
advanced meditative techniques.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And what happens-- you
sometimes lose connection,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.820 align:middle line:84%
when you go into a different
level of consciousness,

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.050 align:middle line:84%
where your body ends and the
rest of the world begins.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
almost a fuzziness--

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.635 align:middle line:90%
a connection to all that goes--

00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like a
bleeding through.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yeah.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is distinctly
what I remember

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.480 align:middle line:90%
happening to me as a child.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But it was just a
normal thing to me.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think of it
as strange or unusual.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's a different
consciousness.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yeah.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.579 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beyond
time, beyond space.

00:22:46.579 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Beyond time and
space, yet still very real.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:84%
It isn't necessarily that
we are off somewhere.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we always
wonder with cats, for example,

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:middle line:90%
what are they doing?

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.270 align:middle line:84%
You see their eyes
open, and they

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:90%
appear to be contemplating.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder,
where is a cat going?

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.857 align:middle line:84%
Where do they go, all
those hours a day?

00:23:05.857 --> 00:23:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:07.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:07.295 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:90%
So you were also in Africa.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And before we
started the on camera

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.870 align:middle line:84%
part of the conversation,
I want to ask you

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.740 align:middle line:84%
what happened with
the lion, but you

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.930 align:middle line:84%
said there was
another conversation

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
you had with some of the
native people there, right?

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.017 align:middle line:90%
Or was it with an animal?

00:23:26.017 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:90%
It was a specific message?

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.577 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Well, I
had all of these.

00:23:28.577 --> 00:23:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Well, the
reason-- my book has

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.530 align:middle line:90%
been gestating my whole life.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I actually
sat down to write this book

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:46.590 align:middle line:84%
was because of an experience I
had in South Africa, about five

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:90%
years ago, with a buffalo.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes I remember that.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And is that what you were
referring to off camera?

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: What I was
telling you about

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
was after I wrote the book,
I went back to South Africa.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to-- although I'm
deeply connected to animals,

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go
even deeper, and I

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
wanted to understand
that connection

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:90%
from the indigenous people.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:90%
And so I spent time--

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was referring to.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.935 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yeah.

00:24:14.935 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I spent time with the San
people in the Kalahari Desert

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:90%
of South Africa.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:10%
And they taught me to go even
deeper in how they connect

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:10%
and how they respond.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.240 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way they live.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So that consciousness
that we were just

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:35.630 align:middle line:84%
speaking about-- those people
still live in that world,

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:90%
as the animals do.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the day, for example,

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:84%
they would gather
at this tree which

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
contains an enormous,
multi-species bird

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:84%
nest with, say,
hundreds of holes in it.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And all the birds
gather there at night.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the humans
gather there at night.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And they all discuss what
went on in the bush that day.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the humans
are included in that.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.180 align:middle line:90%
The veil is not down.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:90%
They are communicating.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And they took me out and
deepened that connection.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And I felt very
satisfied until I then

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:84%
finished that trip with a
journey with the Sangomas.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was going
to be getting accolades

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:84%
for all this great stuff
I had done in the book

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and how connected I am, and they
set me straight immediately.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And this one amazing
Sangoma-- these

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:41.209 align:middle line:84%
are the great teachers in
the tradition-- and the one

00:25:41.209 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:90%
looked at me.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And she actually
took me aside to have

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.730 align:middle line:90%
a one on one conversation.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And she said, if you want to
do the work that you are called

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.710 align:middle line:84%
to do-- and you are-- you
had better deepen your love

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:90%
and connection to the humans.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was shocked
because I didn't

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
think that that was
part of the journey,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't understand it.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And I have come now to
understand the wisdom of that,

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:84%
because that is the
work I'm doing now.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Because if I cannot
teach the humans,

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.210 align:middle line:84%
which is what I've been
called to do by the animals,

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.017 align:middle line:90%
then what's the point?

00:26:24.017 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.487 align:middle line:90%
They are their guardians.

00:26:26.487 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was called to do.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:84%
The buffalo specifically--
and these are my words.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Most of my communications with
animals throughout my life

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:90%
have not required words.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:90%
They have been nonverbal.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.220 align:middle line:84%
But at that point, I
was deeply connected,

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and heard specifically, teach
the humans what you know.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that all the wisdom
and this wonderful knowledge

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and experience that
I have with animals

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:90%
is not just meant for me.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.760 align:middle line:90%
It's meant for everyone.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's so urgently needed now.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So after you
got this message-- OK.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.210 align:middle line:84%
The buffalo had
given you a message.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.530 align:middle line:84%
You are to share what
you know with the people.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Now this Shaman tells
you-- and not just animals.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.727 align:middle line:84%
You need to learn to understand
and love your people.

00:27:15.727 --> 00:27:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: My people.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your people.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.793 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:27:17.793 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now you're
on a book tour, right?

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.403 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:27:20.403 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have to
deal with a lot of people.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening--
you told me off camera--

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.110 align:middle line:84%
is you're getting very
emotional responses from people.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Animals seem to be a
pathway to our heart.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.576 align:middle line:90%
Talk about this experience.

00:27:32.576 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Of course I love
humans, but I have never

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:42.980 align:middle line:84%
been quite as comfortable with
humans as I have naturally

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:90%
been with animals.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was so inspired, through
the early months of my book

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.340 align:middle line:84%
tour, by people who were
coming to me with such passion

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and such love for
animals and the work,

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and sharing my stories, which
is really what we all do.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.090 align:middle line:90%
We don't teach by preaching.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:13.430 align:middle line:84%
We teach by sharing our own
stories and our experiences,

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:90%
and that's what I did.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've been so
inspired by the work

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that just everyday people
are doing out in the world

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.410 align:middle line:90%
to help animals.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.340 align:middle line:90%
And yet, they're broken.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.100 align:middle line:90%
They're shut down in fear.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:26.920 align:middle line:90%
They're worried.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
They're concerned.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able to
help and inspire them

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:84%
through the many different
aspects of my journey.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And I found what really
resonated with people

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and still does, is how when
we advocate for animals,

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and we put our hearts
and souls out there,

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:55.090 align:middle line:84%
that we often shut down
at the critical time,

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.680 align:middle line:90%
when our hearts are broken.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.060 align:middle line:10%
And what I'd share
with people is

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:10%
that that's only part of the
story-- that what we need to do

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:10%
and where we find our greatest
strength and our greatest

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.670 align:middle line:10%
purpose in life is to follow
through that heartbreak.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And Rumi says it-- in
the ruin of heartbreak

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:23.500 align:middle line:84%
is where we find a divine
passion that can wake the dead.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.740 align:middle line:90%
That's where we become strong.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I find that through
telling my stories--

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:32.150 align:middle line:84%
empowering people to stay with
it, stay with your treasures,

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:84%
stay with your gifts, and let
it come back the other end

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and make you stronger and
more effective in your work.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's a direction that
I'm inspired by humans

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.390 align:middle line:90%
to continue doing.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So the Sangomas were completely
accurate in what they

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:90%
were-- they were calling me.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so how did all
this bridge over into working

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.020 align:middle line:90%
with Rupert Sheldrake?

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know the
books he's written,

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and especially the
one on how animals

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
know when their owners are
coming home, which is so true.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
between you two?

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Well, the
stories continue to evolve.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Again, every day I'm
out dealing with people,

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:84%
whether I'm traveling on an
airplane or wherever I am.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:84%
People become very
comfortable to tell me their,

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.220 align:middle line:90%
quote, "unexplained" stories.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Inexplicable
things animals do.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Yeah-- intuitive
connections with animals.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is something that
Rupert Sheldrake and I

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.120 align:middle line:90%
resonate together.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And there is documented
evidence that this does happen.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:84%
The intuitive connection between
humans and animals is real.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
quite how it all works,

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.550 align:middle line:84%
but we do have the stories,
and we do have the studies.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And Rupert has just
stellar human evidence,

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and so does Dean Radin, not
necessarily with animals

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:90%
but with humans-- Psi research.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.030 align:middle line:84%
"Entangled Minds" is
a perfect example.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.430 align:middle line:84%
This is something-- I have
a friend staying at my home

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.710 align:middle line:84%
right now who's been,
while I've been traveling

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.150 align:middle line:90%
a lot, watching my little dogs.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And the little terrier mix
named Ernest-- she said,

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.430 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:84%
He's on the spot 20 minutes,
sitting at the little gate

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:90%
waiting for me to come home.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.162 align:middle line:84%
Whether I've been
gone for an hour

00:31:25.162 --> 00:31:27.620 align:middle line:84%
or whether I've being gone for
10 days, he's there waiting.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Rupert's research
and in my lifelong experience

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:84%
with animals, again,
we don't necessarily

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.260 align:middle line:90%
know how it happens.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.250 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But what I call the
connection-- what the GPS is--

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.810 align:middle line:90%
is the emotional bond.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:90%
It's love.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:90%
That is what the connection is.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And Rupert even said
the intuitive connection

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:90%
happens so often.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Why doesn't it
happen all the time?

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't animals always
finding their way home?

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't know the answer
to that, but what we do know

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:90%
is that love is the attraction.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.642 align:middle line:84%
Love-- and I believe this to be
true-- love is the great force

00:32:11.642 --> 00:32:12.600 align:middle line:90%
that runs the universe.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is what
the entanglement is about.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.847 align:middle line:84%
It's those fields of
love, so to speak.

00:32:16.847 --> 00:32:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Entanglement is.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And again, when
I was a child, it

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:84%
was love that drew me
into my relationship

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:30.650 align:middle line:84%
with those animals, and it
still is-- so that loving bond.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And when we open to that-- and
that is one of the great gifts.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.790 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole chapter
on that in my book,

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:90%
about love, particularly dogs.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Dogs are the great
bodhisattvas--

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.680 align:middle line:90%
the teachers of love.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I know one day I was in
my closet getting ready,

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.921 align:middle line:84%
and in all my inefficiencies
and insecurity saying,

00:32:49.921 --> 00:32:50.920 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to wear?

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.468 align:middle line:90%
This is terrible.

00:32:52.468 --> 00:32:53.480 align:middle line:90%
My hair is a mess.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Everything's a mess.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Why am I even getting
up in the morning?

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And I turned around, and there
was my little dog Pepper,

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:middle line:84%
who's on the cover
of the book, looking

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:90%
at me with a cocked head.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Woman, you are the incarnation
of perfection to me.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:90%
What are you worrying about?

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.773 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:09.773 --> 00:33:10.940 align:middle line:90%
That is so true.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: So they teach
us we are good enough.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And again, in our daily
lives, in our work,

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and in our soul's
calling, we can't

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:26.940 align:middle line:84%
wait until we feel good
enough or wealthy enough

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:84%
or secure enough in
our physical presence.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.520 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.720 align:middle line:84%
In all our brokenness,
animals help

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.375 align:middle line:90%
teach us to show up as we are.

00:33:37.375 --> 00:33:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.916 align:middle line:84%
Well, and they also teach
you to conquer fear.

00:33:39.916 --> 00:33:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your
bus ride in Indonesia.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Oh, yes.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.221 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Held up at gunpoint
or some such thing, yeah?

00:33:45.221 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Animals have so
much to teach us about fear.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Because when our
hearts are broken open,

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and we exist in a world
of love, and we're

00:33:54.330 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:84%
leading an authentic life,
we lose some of that fear.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we're not
fearful, but we're not

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:90%
afraid to look fear in the face.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happened to you?

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Well, this was many
years ago, but I was on a bus

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.780 align:middle line:90%
and doing my thing.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:16.280 align:middle line:84%
It was a local bus, and I was
going from one little town

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.449 align:middle line:84%
And so I was sitting there
by myself, reading a book.

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I was about 3/4 of the
way back in the bus.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't speak the
language, but it didn't matter.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I knew where to
get on and get off.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
looked up and people were

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:32.699 align:middle line:90%
starting to get really nervous.

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:33.690 align:middle line:90%
They started screaming.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I looked up and
there, up by the bus driver,

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.250 align:middle line:90%
was a man who pulled a gun.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand-- I
didn't know the language-- what

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:44.570 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But what I did notice is that
I was stuck in this seat.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:49.730 align:middle line:90%
There was nowhere I could go.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was
screaming around me.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.929 align:middle line:84%
And that gun happened to be
pointed right at my forehead.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly
thought, oh my god.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Some immediate life review
needs to go on right now.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.570 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing I could do.

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly enough,
what happened to me-- perhaps

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:13.850 align:middle line:84%
it was because I couldn't do
anything-- the fight or flight

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:16.780 align:middle line:84%
response didn't kick
in in full force.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But what did happen to me is I
had a thought, I may be gone.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.860 align:middle line:90%
This may be the end of my life.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.130 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was suddenly pulled into
an experience I had when I was

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.590 align:middle line:84%
living in Africa years before,
riding in the bush with

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:90%
my horse, Je t'aime.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And what happened during
that day-- and again,

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.100 align:middle line:84%
it was not an out
of body experience.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I was in my body.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But we rode through the
bush at the end of the day,

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and I let her rip.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.180 align:middle line:90%
She was running full force.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was on there
with her and so

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:59.470 align:middle line:84%
taken in the joy of
aliveness of that moment.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:01.775 align:middle line:84%
It's everything you
want to experience

00:36:01.775 --> 00:36:03.184 align:middle line:90%
in a high moment of meditation.

00:36:03.184 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: It usually
happens out in the world

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.400 align:middle line:90%
when you least expect it.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:90%
It happened to me that day.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.870 align:middle line:90%
And the joy was boundless.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:15.030 align:middle line:84%
What came to my mind while I was
sitting in that bus with a gun

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.890 align:middle line:84%
pointed at my head was my
memory of being with Je t'aime.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And she had obviously crossed
over many years before,

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.140 align:middle line:84%
but I do believe that her
spirit was there with me,

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and we were sharing again
that precious moment.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself, well,
if this is the end of my life,

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:35.870 align:middle line:90%
so be it.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a beautiful way
to experience such a normally

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.840 align:middle line:90%
terrifying moment.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it passed because
you're here with head--

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:90%
with forehead.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.444 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:36:44.444 --> 00:36:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, I would like
you to share some of the dog--

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.170 align:middle line:90%
everyone loves dog stories.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear a few of these
inexplicable kinds of stories--

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.666 align:middle line:84%
for one is the
World War I story.

00:36:54.666 --> 00:36:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that and share that?

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: I love that
story because it happened.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.510 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Now, can we explain it?

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Is it documented?

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a story of a dog
by the name of Prince.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And Prince's owners
lived in London,

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and it was during the time
of World War I. Prince's

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.980 align:middle line:84%
owner, the father,
the husband was

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.340 align:middle line:84%
called to the battlefields
for the war in France.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:90%
So he left.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And the dog afterward was
inconsolable-- stopped eating,

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.660 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't do anything,
disappeared.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So the wife was beside herself,
looked everywhere for the dog,

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:40.600 align:middle line:90%
could not find the dog.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So finally, about
two weeks later,

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.510 align:middle line:84%
she sent by post a letter
to her husband saying,

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm so sorry to tell
you, but Prince is gone.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Prince disappeared.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:57.830 align:middle line:84%
She found out, by return,
post not to worry.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.780 align:middle line:90%
Prince is here with me.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:08.940 align:middle line:84%
That dog managed to find his
way from London to the coast,

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:15.010 align:middle line:84%
to find passage across
the channel into France,

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:21.050 align:middle line:84%
cross a battlefield filled
with a half million soldiers

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:26.030 align:middle line:90%
in battle, found the owner.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
just so beautiful.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:35.410 align:middle line:84%
It is almost unbelievable that
the senses can be that refined.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
the five senses.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Exactly.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.900 align:middle line:90%
So what is the GPS?

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.347 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes-- love.

00:38:41.347 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: It's love.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.310 align:middle line:90%
It's emotional bond.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.372 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about Hector--

00:38:46.372 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Hector?

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
terrier companion

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.420 align:middle line:90%
of Captain William Monte?

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Oh, well,
that's a similar example

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.620 align:middle line:84%
of an animal who
was quite determined

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and knew exactly-- it
was a ship's captain,

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and the dog was always on
the ship with the captain.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Somehow missed the
boat, but somehow--

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and this was,
again, documented--

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.540 align:middle line:84%
got on the exact right ship
that would lead to the ship

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:21.571 align:middle line:84%
that the dog missed--
retrieved his owner.

00:39:21.571 --> 00:39:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Astonished everyone.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.327 align:middle line:90%
And there were witnesses.

00:39:27.327 --> 00:39:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love dog stories.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.411 align:middle line:90%
I love dogs.

00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:31.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So now let's hear a
little bit about Pepper.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.600 align:middle line:84%
You have a situation with
Pepper about the lying

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.210 align:middle line:84%
on the couch thing, which
I think a lot of people

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.380 align:middle line:84%
watching this can relate to,
especially if their dog shed.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.219 align:middle line:84%
It's like, don't you
go lay on the couch.

00:39:44.219 --> 00:39:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Oh, sure.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, Pepper was smarter
than the average dog.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But all dogs are as
smart as they need to be.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes-- to
get the job done.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Exactly.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.090 align:middle line:84%
But the rule in my house
was, cats were allowed,

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.600 align:middle line:84%
but dogs were not allowed
on the white sofa.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.880 align:middle line:90%
And so this was the rule.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I only
found out about a year

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.850 align:middle line:84%
before Pepper passed,
from my two kids,

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:16.910 align:middle line:84%
was that Pepper was
constantly on the white sofa.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But I never caught him--
never, ever caught him.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, my comings and
goings were never, ever--

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wasn't
there any evidence?

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: There was evidence
not on the sofa, because--

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.959 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No hair on the--
he left no signs of his--

00:40:30.959 --> 00:40:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: No.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.010 align:middle line:84%
I was completely ignorant
to this situation.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.902 align:middle line:84%
It went on,
apparently, for years.

00:40:36.902 --> 00:40:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I could just see
it, as you close the door.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:42.139 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Whenever I would come
home-- and he loved his bed.

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:43.930 align:middle line:84%
You see, I guess I just
took it for granted

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.360 align:middle line:84%
that he loved his bed so much,
it wasn't in my thought process

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:90%
to start, oh, looking for hairs.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Pepper always stayed in his bed.

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He obeys.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But my son actually took a
photograph-- evidence for me.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was toward the
end of Pepper's life.

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And there he was, sprawled
out on the white sofa.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I was the only
one that had the rule.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.920 align:middle line:90%
No one else cared.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.149 align:middle line:90%
So he didn't mind--

00:41:11.149 --> 00:41:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: His ears go like
this when mom's coming home.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:13.875 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:41:13.875 --> 00:41:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oops.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: And he actually took
a picture of Pepper sprawled out

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.980 align:middle line:90%
on the sofa.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So he not only
knew that he needed

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.660 align:middle line:84%
to move off the
sofa for me, he knew

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.120 align:middle line:84%
it was quite fine when
everyone else came home,

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.080 align:middle line:90%
that he could stay.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you say, smart
enough to get the job done.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.581 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Smart enough
to get the job done.

00:41:30.581 --> 00:41:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the things
I love in YouTube videos are

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:84%
when you see these
odd companions

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and pairings of animals who
are normally mortal enemies

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.090 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about what what's
actually going on there,

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.910 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, can you believe that?

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.610 align:middle line:90%
A bear or whatever and a dog.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Well, I think animals
experience-- both companion

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:84%
animals and in the wild--
they experience compassion.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.980 align:middle line:90%
They get it.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.640 align:middle line:90%
They have maternal instincts.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Look at elephants.

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this happens
all the time.

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:05.040 align:middle line:90%
On some level, beings know.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.924 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
stories of beings --

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, like
the crow and the cat.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Probably everyone has
seen that one by now.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these things
get 20, 30 million hits.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.507 align:middle line:84%
We're so intrigued
with these pairings.

00:42:15.507 --> 00:42:16.257 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Exactly.

00:42:16.257 --> 00:42:19.070 align:middle line:84%
We're so intrigued
by these stories

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.760 align:middle line:90%
that seem out of the ordinary.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.702 align:middle line:90%
But are there?

00:42:22.702 --> 00:42:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't know.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Are they
out of the ordinary?

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again,
what I'm trying

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.680 align:middle line:84%
to do with my unexplained
powers of animals on my website.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm asking people to go there
and send in their stories.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.600 align:middle line:10%
Because what
mainstream science says

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.790 align:middle line:10%
is paranormal-- psi experiences,
the intuitive connections-- all

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.770 align:middle line:10%
these things-- they
call this paranormal.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:50.110 align:middle line:84%
In my experience and in
other scientists' experience,

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:51.114 align:middle line:90%
this is not paranormal.

00:42:51.114 --> 00:42:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's normal.

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: It is actually normal.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So gathering these stories
and working with them

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and keeping this data
bank is just another way

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.290 align:middle line:90%
of showing that this is normal.

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we need
to just alert everybody

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.430 align:middle line:90%
watching this right now.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:84%
You and Rupert are both
looking for really good stories

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:09.720 align:middle line:90%
from people.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yeah.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.461 align:middle line:90%
Send them in.

00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:14.200 align:middle line:84%
You can go to my website,
and there's a specific place

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:14.980 align:middle line:90%
to put them in.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.971 align:middle line:90%
And we love elephants so much.

00:43:17.971 --> 00:43:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.695 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love elephants.

00:43:19.695 --> 00:43:21.195 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: And I
work with elephants.

00:43:21.195 --> 00:43:24.070 align:middle line:84%
But they are a perfect example
of, look at elephants--

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:25.520 align:middle line:90%
the compassionate they have.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they will walk
miles to go and visit

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:33.710 align:middle line:84%
the bones, the remains,
of beloved family members

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and how they are so
compassionate to one another.

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And to one another.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I was in Thailand
with some elephants

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and watching-- this one
female had bonded with

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and essentially taken
over guardianship

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.230 align:middle line:84%
of another that had been
abused and was blind

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:55.480 align:middle line:90%
and had been brought in.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And her lifetime
was seeing to it

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:00.400 align:middle line:84%
as a seeing eye dog
for the other elephant.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.640 align:middle line:90%
She went nowhere alone.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And she would do what
she had to in the path

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.760 align:middle line:84%
around this other one and
took such good care of her.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And this had been
going on for many years

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.490 align:middle line:90%
by the time we arrived there.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Exactly.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just such commitment--
such love and compassion

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.980 align:middle line:90%
for each other and for humans.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.324 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even humans, in spite of
the things we've done to them.

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:25.260 align:middle line:84%
In spite of-- what elephants
never forget is love.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:27.841 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: And there
was also a recent study

00:44:27.841 --> 00:44:30.930 align:middle line:84%
done-- I laughed because I think
most little kids would know

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:36.230 align:middle line:84%
this-- that all animals have
a personal understanding

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:38.600 align:middle line:90%
of their own uniqueness.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.870 align:middle line:84%
But there was big
news that they found

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:46.300 align:middle line:84%
that elephants understand
mirror-- what's called

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.050 align:middle line:90%
mirror recognition tests.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So when an elephant, like a
human-- you look into a mirror,

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.800 align:middle line:90%
you understand that that's you.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:90%
You recognize yourself.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And elephants would--

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where dogs and
cats are, who's that?

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Well, but
actually-- yeah,

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:06.430 align:middle line:84%
but the elephant takes
the trunk and tests

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and obviously has
self recognition.

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And they said oh my god.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.160 align:middle line:90%
This is so exciting.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Because mirror
recognition is considered

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:20.330 align:middle line:84%
by science one of the
prerequisites for a being

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:22.800 align:middle line:90%
to have a spiritual life.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.770 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought OK, science.

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:26.110 align:middle line:90%
You're catching up.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:27.555 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yeah.

00:45:27.555 --> 00:45:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So learning from the spiritual
lives of animals-- I believe

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.210 align:middle line:90%
that all animals do have that.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.510 align:middle line:84%
But even science is
now saying hey, look.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:38.550 align:middle line:90%
The elephants are capable of it.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK and on that
note, you also witnessed--

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and you write
about the story-- I

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.870 align:middle line:84%
think it was a squirrel
and a beagle, individually,

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:48.957 align:middle line:90%
that had been hit by cars.

00:45:48.957 --> 00:45:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Thank you.

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:51.248 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about that

00:45:51.248 --> 00:45:53.400 align:middle line:84%
because we have
all witnessed this.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.830 align:middle line:84%
It's horrible when you
see the little bodies.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And some people have
accidentally hit them

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.045 align:middle line:84%
in the country, and you just--
it's so hard to deal with.

00:46:01.045 --> 00:46:01.628 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:46:01.628 --> 00:46:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you brought
that up because--

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and people, again, come to me
about this specific problem

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.430 align:middle line:90%
often.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And I can, again, tell you
my personal experience.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And as a veterinarian
and as a healer--

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and I'm an empath--
my whole life,

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.150 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the most
difficult lessons I ever

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:27.140 align:middle line:84%
had to learn, was about what
I call the power of presence.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I am here to heal, to
save-- to save animals,

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:32.790 align:middle line:90%
to rescue animals.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I was walking down the street
one day with friends, just

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:39.270 align:middle line:90%
on a late afternoon walk.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And as we were turning on
the last leg of our walk,

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:44.540 align:middle line:90%
I saw a car approaching.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I heard a woman scream.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I saw a young dog
bolting off her porch.

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, oh my god,
that animal-- that dog was-- I

00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.000 align:middle line:90%
held my breath.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I was too far away
to do anything,

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.230 align:middle line:84%
but I was close
enough to witness it.

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And the dog almost made
it across the street,

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:09.760 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And it flew up in the air--
it was horrible-- and landed.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So by then, I was running
over to the scene.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And I got there in time
to just scoop up the dog,

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and it died in my
arms immediately.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And my two friends were
consoling the woman.

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:29.500 align:middle line:90%
And it was quite awful.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing
else I could do.

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And I went home
that evening and I

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.320 align:middle line:84%
thought-- because I am an empath
and I want to heal and rescue

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.450 align:middle line:84%
as many animals as I can--
I couldn't figure out,

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:43.850 align:middle line:90%
why was I there?

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I was too far to
help and stop it,

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:52.050 align:middle line:84%
but I was still there to witness
and feel the pain and grief

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.810 align:middle line:90%
of this situation.

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:56.710 align:middle line:90%
It seemed senseless to me.

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And a few days later, a
similar experience happened.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:90%
And I was driving down the road.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:09.710 align:middle line:84%
A car in front of me
wasn't paying attention,

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:12.770 align:middle line:84%
but a squirrel bolted
out into the road.

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And I saw oh, no--
as squirrels do.

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:17.980 align:middle line:90%
The woman didn't hit the brakes.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, the squirrel was hit.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:23.080 align:middle line:90%
She kept going.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.110 align:middle line:84%
I stopped my car, as I always
do, in the middle of the road,

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:30.220 align:middle line:84%
to get out and try
to do something.

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:34.640 align:middle line:84%
As I jumped out of the
car, I got about, oh,

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe six feet away
from the squirrel.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:38.330 align:middle line:90%
His back was to me.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:39.930 align:middle line:90%
It was still alive.

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And I stood there
unsure what I could do.

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And with that, the squirrel
twisted its body around,

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:51.050 align:middle line:90%
and it faced me and stood up.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And its face-- this squirrel
looked at me right in the eyes.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, Regina, I had
never seen the face of God

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:03.160 align:middle line:90%
so clearly in front of me.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.290 align:middle line:90%
And I just gasped.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And the squirrel, with that,
fell over, and it was dead.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So I got the squirrel
off the street,

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.867 align:middle line:90%
took it home, and buried it.

00:49:12.867 --> 00:49:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: But what
I realized and what

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:18.520 align:middle line:84%
was the powerful lesson
to be learned there--

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and this is what we need to
understand-- the power of just

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.690 align:middle line:84%
being there-- the
power of presence

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:30.180 align:middle line:90%
is far more-- it's huge.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.460 align:middle line:84%
It is so much more
important than we realize.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.940 align:middle line:84%
We think that being
there isn't doing.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:36.370 align:middle line:90%
We're not there to do.

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:41.197 align:middle line:84%
We're there to be with and
help another being crossover.

00:49:41.197 --> 00:49:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.856 align:middle line:90%
That's very powerful.

00:49:42.856 --> 00:49:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:49.600 align:middle line:84%
In your book, you give people--
it's kind of a tutorial,

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.300 align:middle line:84%
as well, to tell us how
we can go into resonance.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.050 align:middle line:84%
We have 5 or 10
minutes left before we

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:58.682 align:middle line:84%
need to get on to what you're
doing absolutely right now,

00:49:58.682 --> 00:50:00.890 align:middle line:84%
which you kind of mentioned
already-- you and Rupert.

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about-- people
are saying, how can I do that?

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what my
dog's trying to tell me.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:09.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying that.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.513 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what Ernest
is trying to tell me.

00:50:11.513 --> 00:50:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Sure.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about how

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.174 align:middle line:90%
we begin the process of this.

00:50:15.174 --> 00:50:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing we do is
develop a personal practice.

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And what I tell
people all the time

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and what I do-- I've been
a longtime meditator.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
connect on a deeper level,

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:34.710 align:middle line:84%
which is where we
really need to go--

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that it
isn't only connecting more

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.150 align:middle line:90%
with our animals.

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:43.080 align:middle line:84%
It's connecting more with
all beings-- with each other.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It isn't only about
animal communication.

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And to do that-- open that
process-- we have to go inward.

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:54.040 align:middle line:84%
We have to consider
what's going on inside,

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:56.680 align:middle line:84%
not what's going in
the outside world.

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.820 align:middle line:90%
So we have to go in.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And I have a whole chapter
on exercises and things,

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:05.920 align:middle line:84%
simple things, easy things
people can do to connect.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And the number one
thing that people can do

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:11.860 align:middle line:84%
is relax, and close
your eyes, and go

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:16.630 align:middle line:84%
into a private space
within yourself,

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and pay attention to who's
paying attention, who's

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:25.620 align:middle line:84%
listening, who's thinking
the thoughts, who's

00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.014 align:middle line:90%
having the experience.

00:51:27.014 --> 00:51:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, see,
the thing is, those

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.180 align:middle line:84%
are things that I'm very
comfortable with and such.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:35.260 align:middle line:84%
But I never actually--
for some dodo reason,

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.410 align:middle line:84%
it never occurred to
me from that place.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Usually it's when you're
frustrated or confused.

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Ernest, what are you
trying to tell me?

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I wasn't
stopping to think,

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:49.530 align:middle line:84%
just put that into
your meditation

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:50.894 align:middle line:90%
and see what Ernest has to say.

00:51:50.894 --> 00:51:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
something as simple--

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.867 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the people
watching right now do meditate.

00:51:54.867 --> 00:51:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:57.226 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: And I
think what we have

00:51:57.226 --> 00:51:59.610 align:middle line:84%
to remember is that we
get stuck in our heads.

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And people say this to me a
lot-- I want to know what this,

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be that,
I wanna understand

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.081 align:middle line:90%
what my animal is saying.

00:52:05.081 --> 00:52:07.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, you're up here.

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
come from here.

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.521 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good point.

00:52:10.521 --> 00:52:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: It's like,
shut up and listen.

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: So close down-- try.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I know the only people who
aren't thinking are dead.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:21.340 align:middle line:84%
But still, we
quiet the thoughts,

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and we go into-- as
we do in deep prayer,

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:28.880 align:middle line:84%
we go into a connection
that says, I'm here.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm simply here, showing up.

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.890 align:middle line:90%
I am listening.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:36.290 align:middle line:90%
I am open in my heart.

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:38.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's where you begin.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
become magnetically

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.520 align:middle line:90%
attractive to other beings.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And the more receptive
you are, then

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:54.027 align:middle line:84%
the more willing other
beings are to attune to you.

00:52:54.027 --> 00:52:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
teach this to people?

00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:57.193 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: I teach
people all the time.

00:52:57.193 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:84%
But I teach people to not pay
attention to communicating

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:01.470 align:middle line:90%
with an animal.

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:05.564 align:middle line:84%
I teach people to pay attention
to communicating with all life.

00:53:05.564 --> 00:53:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Just to open their field to a
receptive state and then use

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:11.127 align:middle line:90%
your dog or cat or whatever --

00:53:11.127 --> 00:53:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe this is the
most important conversation

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that people need to
have in the world today,

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:24.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's-- the urgency
to switch our consciousness

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:28.250 align:middle line:84%
to this awareness is critical
for the survival not only

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of the animals that I advocate
for, but for all of us

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:35.050 align:middle line:90%
for humans as well.

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Because again, what we do to
the animals, we do to ourselves.

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So that communication is
with all life-- all life.

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And often, people won't
take a proactive stance even

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:47.940 align:middle line:84%
in their own life, settle
down enough to listen,

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:49.650 align:middle line:84%
but often will be
motivated to do

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:52.220 align:middle line:84%
so if they have some
kind of an issue going on

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.547 align:middle line:90%
with their beloved animal.

00:53:53.547 --> 00:53:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yes.

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:54.790 align:middle line:90%
And exactly.

00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And the perks are,
when you start

00:53:56.750 --> 00:54:01.100 align:middle line:84%
tuning in, you become
attractive to not only animals,

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.190 align:middle line:90%
but to humans.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:04.250 align:middle line:90%
It isn't exclusive.

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:06.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a package deal.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:10.280 align:middle line:84%
You tune in in a way
through your heart

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that helps, on all levels,
communicating with all beings.

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can get pretty
deep into it-- maybe

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:21.942 align:middle line:84%
even sometimes deeper than
you may have bargained for.

00:54:21.942 --> 00:54:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You might be
hearing too many voices.

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:24.566 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:54:24.566 --> 00:54:25.690 align:middle line:90%
But that's what I teach.

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And I am particularly
drawn to people

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:34.580 align:middle line:84%
who want to go deeper to
lead a life of purpose

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and express those deep
callings of the heart

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and express that passion
and compassion into action

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.530 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:44.346 align:middle line:90%
That's what we--

00:54:44.346 --> 00:54:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
toward that end,

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.800 align:middle line:84%
just tell us where you're
going with your work.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.200 align:middle line:84%
You've already said
on your website, which

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.307 align:middle line:90%
is LindaBender.org, right?

00:54:51.307 --> 00:54:52.390 align:middle line:10%
>>BENDER: LindaBender.org.

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:55.140 align:middle line:10%
You can get hold of me and see
all the mischief I'm up to.

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:55.769 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:55.769 --> 00:54:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: --which
hopefully is a lot.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:00.069 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also send in our
stories about our animals--

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:02.110 align:middle line:84%
the unique things we've
seen them do-- witnessed.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.023 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:04.023 --> 00:55:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: Because it's
important to bring this out.

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:10.220 align:middle line:90%
We are evolving, all of us.

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Whether we like it or
not, we are becoming

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.030 align:middle line:90%
intuitive spiritual beings.

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Because they go together.

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.930 align:middle line:84%
When you're intuitive,
you are automatically

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:22.040 align:middle line:90%
open to a more spiritual realm.

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.200 align:middle line:84%
We're coming out of just
being physical mental beings.

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Five senses,
yeah-- coming out of that.

00:55:27.375 --> 00:55:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yeah.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So before
we sign off, has there

00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:34.590 align:middle line:84%
been any kind of
shift in the messages

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:37.250 align:middle line:84%
from the animal
kingdom as of late?

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.206 align:middle line:84%
Do you see some kind
of shifts going on?

00:55:39.206 --> 00:55:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Well, I do.

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
animals can no longer

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:45.940 align:middle line:84%
live in blissful ignorance
of us in the wild.

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they're trying
to connect with us.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Where before, they didn't
need to, now they are.

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.890 align:middle line:90%
And there's an urgency.

00:55:56.890 --> 00:56:01.360 align:middle line:84%
There is an urgency
to not only--

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.220 align:middle line:84%
we're making their
lives miserable,

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:07.890 align:middle line:84%
but they see that we're making
our own lives miserable.

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why so much of
my work is helping-- yes,

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I've worked many years in
the trenches with wildlife.

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.520 align:middle line:90%
So I work toward that.

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I also work right
here in this country

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:21.550 align:middle line:84%
where we love our animals
and our dogs so much.

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Euthanasia is the number one
form of death in healthy,

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:28.420 align:middle line:84%
under two-year-old dogs
and cats in this country.

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.650 align:middle line:90%
We euthanize about 9,000 a day.

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:34.430 align:middle line:84%
We need to do
something about that.

00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:36.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not an animal problem.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.210 align:middle line:90%
It is a human problem.

00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And on that note,
one final question.

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think we did discuss
it in our last show.

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:48.630 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel
about euthanizing

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:51.220 align:middle line:84%
a dog who is suffering--
an elderly-- as

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.654 align:middle line:84%
opposed to letting them go
through the whole process?

00:56:53.654 --> 00:56:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Well I think, again, animals are
comfortable with passing over,

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.340 align:middle line:90%
more so than we are.

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, that's not
something we want to do.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:08.570 align:middle line:84%
But to put an animal out of
suffering at the very end--

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:09.070 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:12.254 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's
something that--

00:57:12.254 --> 00:57:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's humane.

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: It's humane
and it's also--

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:19.230 align:middle line:84%
what I always teach people
to do is, you must be there

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.950 align:middle line:90%
with your animal.

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BENDER: That's so important--
that's the power of presence--

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:26.035 align:middle line:90%
being there.

00:57:26.035 --> 00:57:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of
the maybe saddest moments

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:35.200 align:middle line:84%
of my entire life is my love
of my life dog from many years

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.890 align:middle line:90%
ago was at the final stage.

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And I had to take her in
because she had white gums.

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.870 align:middle line:84%
She was bleeding
internally and all.

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And the vet saw that I
was emotional and said,

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
should be here.

00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:50.130 align:middle line:90%
This was a number of years ago.

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Yeah.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.110 align:middle line:90%
That's different now.

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I
backed out of the room.

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's haunted me
forever because she

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:57.810 align:middle line:84%
turned back and looked
at me and was frantic.

00:57:57.810 --> 00:57:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's frozen
in my being forever.

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I would never,
ever do that again.

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Right.

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:03.940 align:middle line:90%
But you know she forgave you.

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Of course.

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:08.140 align:middle line:84%
She was the most loving little
being I think I've ever met.

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: That's right.

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So yeah.

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:09.835 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: That's right.

00:58:09.835 --> 00:58:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, on
that note, thank

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.220 align:middle line:84%
you so much for the work
you do and for sharing

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:17.101 align:middle line:84%
this gentle and loving story of
communion between these realms

00:58:17.101 --> 00:58:17.600 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it, Linda.

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Thank you.

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.450 align:middle line:90%
May I say one final thing?

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure, you may.

00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:22.143 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: I say it all the time.

00:58:22.143 --> 00:58:23.220 align:middle line:10%
I say it in my book.

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:26.190 align:middle line:10%
Please, everyone, do
something from your heart

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:27.790 align:middle line:10%
to help animals.

00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And don't be afraid to
make a lot of noise.

00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:34.546 align:middle line:90%
>>BENDER: Thank you, Regina.

00:58:34.546 --> 00:58:36.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the name of
the book is "Animal Wisdom,"

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:40.260 align:middle line:10%
and it can be found on Linda's
site at LindaBender.org,

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.290 align:middle line:10%
