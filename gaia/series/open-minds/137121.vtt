[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:29.029 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH:
Not long ago,

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:10%
we aired my interview with
Travis Christofferson,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.492 align:middle line:10%
who authored "Tripping
Over the Truth,"

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:36.161 align:middle line:10%
having to do with the
metabolic theory of cancer.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.663 align:middle line:84%
Today, we continue
the conversation

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:41.166 align:middle line:84%
with Dominic D'Agostino,
a molecular pharmacology

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.002 align:middle line:84%
researcher who explains
the role of ketones

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.838 align:middle line:84%
in our cellular health--
not just for cancer, also

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:50.008 align:middle line:84%
for weight loss, inflammation,
and many other functions.

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.387 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad to have you here
to flesh out this conversation.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.722 align:middle line:84%
People loved the
interview with Travis,

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.934 align:middle line:84%
but it also created quite
a storm of controversy.

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:03.105 align:middle line:84%
Because to create the ketogenic
or metabolic effect really

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:06.692 align:middle line:84%
requires low carbohydrates
and high fats.

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:09.653 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of the vegans
who are in our audience really

00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:11.196 align:middle line:90%
objected to this.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:14.199 align:middle line:84%
And so the nice thing
is that a lot of that

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:16.326 align:middle line:84%
is remedied in
today's conversation.

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.288 align:middle line:84%
Because you are specifically
addressing that.

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:20.706 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to get there.

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:24.167 align:middle line:84%
But first, when I first
found out about your work,

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.045 align:middle line:84%
I was intrigued that your
original studies started

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.423 align:middle line:84%
under the Department
of Defense, right?

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.549 align:middle line:90%
>>DOMINIC D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.051 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so let's talk
about what you tripped over

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:35.887 align:middle line:90%
yourself in your studies, OK?

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.806 align:middle line:10%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, it's
a good way to put it.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:41.977 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, about 10 years ago,
the original grant that I had

00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:46.273 align:middle line:10%
was to essentially
understand fundamentally

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:49.359 align:middle line:10%
what's called oxygen
toxicity seizures.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.402 align:middle line:10%
And that occurs in the
presence of breathing

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:54.531 align:middle line:10%
high oxygen associated
with military operations.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.241 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like
underwater, like SEALs?

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.118 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Underwater,
yes, so Navy SEALs.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.704 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: High concentrations
in their tanks of oxygen, OK.

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:01.496 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:03.081 align:middle line:84%
They use a closed
circuit rebreather.

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:06.418 align:middle line:84%
And the advantage is that there
are no bubbles that come up

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:07.627 align:middle line:90%
when you're scuba diving.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Like open circuit scuba, you
have lots of bubbles coming up.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.507 align:middle line:84%
There's no bubbles, so there's
a stealth component to it.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So no detection.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.884 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:17.471 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And oxygen
toxicity seizures are also

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:22.059 align:middle line:84%
a limitation for hyperbaric
oxygen therapy, which is--

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.686 align:middle line:84%
so if you could
develop a strategy

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:27.731 align:middle line:84%
to prevent oxygen toxicity
seizures for Navy SEALs,

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.983 align:middle line:84%
then you could potentially
increase the oxygen

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.195 align:middle line:84%
concentration for
hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's another sort of
application for the things

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.615 align:middle line:90%
that we're developing.

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:40.952 align:middle line:84%
But first, because
we didn't understand

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:44.206 align:middle line:84%
why these seizures occur
and how to predict them,

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:45.624 align:middle line:84%
we had to understand
fundamentally

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:47.125 align:middle line:90%
what was causing them.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.503 align:middle line:84%
So the Department of
Defense funded our lab

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:52.714 align:middle line:84%
to develop special
equipment, which was--

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.133 align:middle line:84%
I guess you would call it
hyperbaric environmental

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:55.926 align:middle line:90%
chambers.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:58.303 align:middle line:84%
So they're a chamber
that would essentially

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:01.098 align:middle line:84%
mimic the conditions of the
extreme environment, which

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:05.227 align:middle line:84%
would be high pressure oxygen
and pressure per se of any gas,

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.273 align:middle line:84%
So we developed this technology,
and inside the chambers

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:15.529 align:middle line:84%
we had microscopes, like
similar to an electron

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.155 align:middle line:84%
microscope you may
be familiar with.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.116 align:middle line:84%
But the microscope that
we installed inside

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
was called atomic
force microscope.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.954 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us about that
for just a second without

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.164 align:middle line:84%
deviating too much, because
I'm interested in this.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.833 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah,
it's called the AFM,

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:29.084 align:middle line:90%
and it uses a scanning probe.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:32.879 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you the resolution
of an electron microscope,

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.923 align:middle line:84%
but you can actually look
at live tissue with it.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So kind of like the
Ergonom 400 and all the early

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.346 align:middle line:84%
Rife technologies but
more advanced now?

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.305 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yes.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.265 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:45.976 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Scanning electron
microscope and TM allows you

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:50.105 align:middle line:84%
to image nanoscopic features
of the cell and down

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:51.106 align:middle line:90%
to the membrane.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:55.902 align:middle line:84%
And so this technology allows
us to fundamentally understand

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.487 align:middle line:90%
what's happening at the level--

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:58.655 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As the
cells are still living.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:03:59.406 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: --of the
cell in the membrane.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.365 align:middle line:90%
Yes, while they're living.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.199 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.577 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: So we developed
that technology and also

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
fluorescence, or what's
called confocal microscopy

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.956 align:middle line:90%
inside the chamber.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:12.085 align:middle line:84%
And we began to realize
that in studying neurons

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:17.257 align:middle line:84%
that they respond in a way where
their mitochondria over-produce

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:21.219 align:middle line:84%
oxygen free radicals,
which occurs naturally,

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.096 align:middle line:84%
but in the context of
breathing high oxygen,

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:26.016 align:middle line:84%
they overproduce
more free radicals.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.603 align:middle line:84%
And these free radicals
impacts cellular metabolism.

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:33.607 align:middle line:84%
So the metabolism actually
becomes dysregulated.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:40.947 align:middle line:84%
And if you prevent or impair
the bioenergetic capacity

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:84%
of the brain by inhibiting
metabolic functions

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, each cell is
kind of like a little battery.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.873 align:middle line:84%
And it has electrical
charge called

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.832 align:middle line:90%
the resting membrane potential.

00:04:51.832 --> 00:04:54.044 align:middle line:84%
And as a neuroscientist,
like we do

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:57.881 align:middle line:84%
recordings measuring resting
membrane potential, firing

00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.924 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.301 align:middle line:84%
And this was
tremendously impacted

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.553 align:middle line:90%
by high levels of oxygen.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you could preserve
brain energy metabolism

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.144 align:middle line:84%
with another
metabolic substrate--

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:15.440 align:middle line:84%
we knew that the
brain ran off glucose.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.193 align:middle line:84%
If we could provide a source
of energy to the brain,

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:22.197 align:middle line:84%
we could conceivably
at this time

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.908 align:middle line:84%
preserve brain energy
metabolism in the face

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:27.994 align:middle line:84%
of oxidative stress, which
would be high-pressure oxygen.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.496 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Glucose
wouldn't do that.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.581 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Well,
the glucose is what

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:32.832 align:middle line:90%
we used in our experiments.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.835 align:middle line:84%
And we would see that with
high levels of oxygen,

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:39.965 align:middle line:84%
glucose actually can
exacerbate oxidative stress.

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:42.801 align:middle line:84%
It can cause more
oxidative stress.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.929 align:middle line:84%
But we did know that there was
other metabolic substrates,

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:49.224 align:middle line:84%
including ketones,
which we study

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:51.351 align:middle line:84%
from many different
perspectives now.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.187 align:middle line:84%
And I guess simply put,
when you metabolize

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.481 align:middle line:90%
a ketone for energy--

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:59.359 align:middle line:84%
the ATP is the energy
currency of the body.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.445 align:middle line:84%
When cells make
ATP from ketones,

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:06.032 align:middle line:84%
they produce less
oxygen free radicals.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
So oxygen free radicals
are a consequence

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.372 align:middle line:84%
of just normal
cellular metabolism.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:16.209 align:middle line:84%
And you get more of them when
you metabolize glucose than you

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.502 align:middle line:90%
when you metabolize ketones.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So the energy
efficiency of the cell,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.008 align:middle line:84%
we call that the Delta
G of ATP hydrolysis.

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:25.302 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
fancy term you use.

00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:28.221 align:middle line:84%
Basically it's like a
cleaner-burning fuel.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:31.516 align:middle line:84%
And you get more energy
per oxygen molecule.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the studies that we did
in cells and in tissues kind of

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.774 align:middle line:84%
allowed us to
understand fundamentally

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.485 align:middle line:84%
that if we enhance
cellular metabolism,

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.905 align:middle line:84%
then we could prevent
or delay seizures.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:51.369 align:middle line:84%
And these early experiments
led me to the ketogenic diet.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.038 align:middle line:84%
Because I was testing
pharmacological

00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:58.585 align:middle line:84%
compounds, and you don't want to
give a war fighter, especially

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.837 align:middle line:84%
a Navy SEAL, an
anti-seizure drug,

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:05.258 align:middle line:84%
because you can impair cognitive
and physical performance.

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:09.054 align:middle line:84%
And a quick search
online looking

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:12.849 align:middle line:84%
at what do people do when
drugs fail to control seizures

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:13.933 align:middle line:90%
if you don't want to use--

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.435 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right,
ketogenic diet.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.188 align:middle line:84%
That was backed into also
a long time ago, wasn't it?

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.231 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, 100
years ago, actually.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:21.524 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 100 years ago, yeah.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.693 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Mayo Clinic
and now Johns Hopkins,

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.111 align:middle line:84%
they run a really
active program.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.365 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's about
150 clinics in the US

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:31.451 align:middle line:84%
that have dietitians and
neurologists that implement

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.787 align:middle line:84%
this for not only
pediatric epilepsy,

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.998 align:middle line:84%
but also adult epilepsy
and now an emerging

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:41.086 align:middle line:84%
list of neurological
disorders and even cancer.

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
the field that I'm in.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.133 align:middle line:84%
The military became
sort of convinced,

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.718 align:middle line:84%
the Office of Navy
Research, that this

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:52.889 align:middle line:84%
was a fruitful direction
to go into for preventing

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.557 align:middle line:90%
oxygen toxicity seizures.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.351 align:middle line:84%
But they were not
very enthusiastic

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.853 align:middle line:84%
about a high-fat,
low-carbohydrate diet.

00:07:58.853 --> 00:08:01.189 align:middle line:84%
They thought it would be
very hard to implement.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:06.403 align:middle line:84%
So we began investigating the
potential for exogenous ketones

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:10.323 align:middle line:84%
to be-- so your body
produces ketones in response

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.618 align:middle line:84%
to a very strict diet
or prolonged fasting.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.329 align:middle line:84%
Could we mimic this
physiological state

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:20.582 align:middle line:84%
with synthetic or
naturally-derived ketogenic

00:08:20.582 --> 00:08:24.587 align:middle line:84%
metabolites that we could
make in the lab and give that?

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:27.924 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, this is kind
of the holy grail in a sense

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:28.925 align:middle line:90%
because so many people--

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:30.135 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: I'm a little
biased, but I think so.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.721 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I'm saying that
simply because so many people

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.722 align:middle line:90%
can't stick to a ketogenic diet.

00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:37.225 align:middle line:84%
Them you have vegetarians,
which is more problematic.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:84%
Then you have vegans,
even more problematic.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:39.977 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yes, yes.

00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so if you're
embracing the whole metabolic

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.029 align:middle line:84%
theory of cancer to begin with,
it really is reliant upon be

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:53.575 align:middle line:84%
able to create or take in or
somehow have ketones present,

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.367 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.661 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, compliance is the key.

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.204 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you
look at studies where

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.957 align:middle line:84%
the diet didn't have the
effect that you would expect

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.668 align:middle line:84%
or didn't work at all, you
realize that they didn't even

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:08.381 align:middle line:84%
measure ketones or they didn't
have a registered dietitian

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:11.843 align:middle line:84%
that is skilled in implementing
the ketogenic diet.

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:14.012 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely essential.

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:17.056 align:middle line:84%
I went through a nutrition
RD program as an undergrad,

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:20.018 align:middle line:84%
and they teach us that these
high-fat diets are bad,

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:23.438 align:middle line:84%
even though clinically
we know they work.

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:29.319 align:middle line:84%
And the Johns Hopkins
protocol was really about--

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.739 align:middle line:84%
it's a dairy-based,
lots of saturated fat,

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.784 align:middle line:84%
even hydrogenated oils,
the original diet.

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:38.828 align:middle line:84%
But now our knowledge of
nutrition is evolving,

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and the food choices, I think,
are equally as important

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.044 align:middle line:90%
as the macronutrient ratios.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.631 align:middle line:84%
So there's a certain ratio
of fat to protein to carbs

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:52.133 align:middle line:84%
that allows your body
to get into ketosis,

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.886 align:middle line:84%
and that mimics the
state of fasting.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:59.015 align:middle line:84%
And what dieticians
don't really appreciate

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:02.602 align:middle line:84%
is that the source of these
fats and proteins or carbs

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.355 align:middle line:84%
are extremely important,
not just the numbers

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:06.397 align:middle line:90%
that they're calculating.

00:10:06.397 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.608 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: So I think we--

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.652 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It can't be
the fake butter that's put

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.195 align:middle line:84%
on your popcorn at
the movie theater.

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:13.363 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:14.155 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.325 align:middle line:84%
Even specific fats, like for
seizures or other disorders,

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:21.287 align:middle line:84%
docosahexaenoic acid,
which is a fish oil,

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.456 align:middle line:84%
has remarkable
neuroprotective properties.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:26.835 align:middle line:84%
So you would want to
incorporate that particular oil

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.504 align:middle line:84%
into a ketogenic diet
with food sources or even

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:30.839 align:middle line:90%
supplementation.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.882 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
other fats, like

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:35.093 align:middle line:84%
medium-chain
triglycerides, which

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.928 align:middle line:90%
are derived from coconut oil.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.304 align:middle line:90%
And we call them MCTs.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And we know that when we
ingest these ketogenic fats,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:90%
our body produces more ketones.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.313 align:middle line:84%
So it actually is
more therapeutic.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.942 align:middle line:84%
And there's dozens of different
fats that we shouldn't use

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:90%
and some that we should use.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.739 align:middle line:84%
And this information needs to be
incorporated into personalizing

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:57.615 align:middle line:90%
a ketogenic diet.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:58.867 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: For
your own chemistry.

00:10:58.867 --> 00:10:59.325 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yes.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.994 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And for you on
lifestyle choice-- both.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.036 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yes, yes, yes.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:04.163 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, I'm going
to break some of this that

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:07.625 align:middle line:84%
you've just mentioned down into
very specific-- first of all,

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.044 align:middle line:84%
if you can just explain
what ketones are and what

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:12.046 align:middle line:84%
their function is
really simply .

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.257 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to ask
a few more simple questions

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:15.049 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:16.467 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: OK, sure.

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:19.679 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to start
describing ketones

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.514 align:middle line:90%
in the context of fasting.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:25.685 align:middle line:84%
So if we stopped eating
today, by this time next week,

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:30.189 align:middle line:84%
our brain would be using
about 3/4 to 2/3 of its energy

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:32.817 align:middle line:84%
from ketone bodies
instead of glucose.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.944 align:middle line:90%
So we were taught--

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:37.113 align:middle line:84%
many are taught--
that glucose is

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.907 align:middle line:90%
the only source for the brain.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.491 align:middle line:84%
But now we know--
there were studies

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:43.453 align:middle line:84%
done in the '70s that actually
changed the medical texts.

00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.246 align:middle line:84%
And our brain is
like a hybrid engine.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:84%
It uses glucose, but
in periods of fasting

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
or the ketogenic diet, it
has the metabolic flexibility

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.463 align:middle line:84%
to adapt from using
glucose to using ketones.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you run
off ketones, which

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.093 align:middle line:84%
are small,
four-carbon molecules,

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.887 align:middle line:90%
they generate lots of energy.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:03.389 align:middle line:84%
There like a high-octane
fuel, more or less.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.266 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is it always
a fail-safe mechanism

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:90%
in your body, though?

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.772 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yes, unless
you have Type 1 diabetes,

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:11.689 align:middle line:90%
it could be dangerous.

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:14.692 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, I
mean pretty much everybody,

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.194 align:middle line:90%
we're hardwired to have this.

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:18.947 align:middle line:84%
Because humans went through
periods of limited food

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.865 align:middle line:90%
availability and famine.

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:25.078 align:middle line:84%
So ketosis is a natural
state of human physiology.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And a high-carbohydrate diet
that's fed at least three times

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.087 align:middle line:84%
a day has silenced that
genetic program, if you will,

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.505 align:middle line:90%
that is activated in humans.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.257 align:middle line:84%
Like it never gets activated
because we're constantly

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:39.884 align:middle line:84%
stimulating the
release of insulin

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.344 align:middle line:84%
through high-carbohydrate
sources.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:44.347 align:middle line:84%
And that can lead to chronic
inflammation and early-onset

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:90%
of chronic diseases.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.685 align:middle line:84%
So simply periodic,
short-term fasting--

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:52.021 align:middle line:84%
or you can mimic fasting with
a low-carb ketogenic diet.

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:53.815 align:middle line:84%
And we're interested
in all variations

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.984 align:middle line:84%
of that, intermittent
fasting, low-carb diets,

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:57.235 align:middle line:90%
ketogenic diets.

00:12:57.235 --> 00:13:00.363 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because in our early
iteration as human beings,

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:03.282 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have access to
high-carbohydrate food sources

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:04.409 align:middle line:90%
for the most part, right?

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.119 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah,
not like we do today,

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:06.911 align:middle line:84%
not in the processed
carbohydrates.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.913 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, there might
be some berries or some wild

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:09.706 align:middle line:90%
fruit somewhere.

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:12.125 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, and
even the wild berries

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:17.005 align:middle line:84%
that I get at the store,
they have about half

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.841 align:middle line:84%
of the sugar and
a lot more fiber.

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.593 align:middle line:84%
And you'd have to be
pretty gutsy to knock down

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:84%
like a beehive to get
the honey or to even

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.474 align:middle line:90%
come across fruit trees.

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.227 align:middle line:84%
And the fruit today has
been hybridized in a way--

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.311 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Much sweeter.

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.105 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: I grew
up farming, so I know.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:36.816 align:middle line:84%
Things have much more dense
forms of carbohydrate.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:37.775 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true.

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:40.445 align:middle line:84%
And we don't see how it has
kind of sneaked up on us.

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.864 align:middle line:84%
The other day I was at a
farmer's market at home,

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.783 align:middle line:84%
and they had old-fashioned
Gravenstein apples

00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:48.077 align:middle line:84%
from an old orchard, which
you don't see anymore.

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.871 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that
reminds me of my youth.

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So I picked up a couple,
and it's like, whoa,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.832 align:middle line:90%
this is really--

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:53.165 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Like a
crab apple or something.

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.501 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I didn't
remember how tart they were.

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:57.211 align:middle line:84%
When I was young I
just loved the flavor,

00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:58.796 align:middle line:84%
but we've become
really accustomed

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:02.508 align:middle line:84%
to the sugar content of
everything, vegetables, fruit,

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.968 align:middle line:84%
and certainly all
processed food.

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:04.761 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:05.553 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.305 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the apples
like 10,000 years ago

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:10.683 align:middle line:84%
were like little crab
apples the size of a walnut.

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:14.187 align:middle line:84%
And they were basically fiber
with very limited amount

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:90%
of sugar, relatively speaking.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.649 align:middle line:90%
So early man is--

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:21.235 align:middle line:84%
I kind of have an interest
in studying the evolution

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:22.737 align:middle line:90%
of human nutrition.

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:26.115 align:middle line:84%
And early man really
consumed a lot of--

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:29.702 align:middle line:84%
he'd be lucky if they got
100 grams of carbs a day

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.579 align:middle line:90%
or 150 per day.

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.499 align:middle line:84%
And that's really high in fiber,
like almost half of it's fiber.

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.459 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right, which cuts
down the actual net carbs.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.294 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah,
the net carbs is like--

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.087 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 20?

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, 20
or 30 or something like.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.508 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, which is like
a pretty strict ketogenic diet.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:44.258 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:45.051 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:48.304 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And
things like carb foods

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.640 align:middle line:84%
like in a ketogenic diet
would be macadamia nuts.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.226 align:middle line:84%
And a cup has
something-- or half

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.394 align:middle line:84%
a cup has like 20
grams of carbs.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:58.147 align:middle line:84%
But net carbs, I think
it's under three grams.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:59.482 align:middle line:90%
So they're non-glycemic.

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:04.779 align:middle line:84%
And actually, a macadamia nut is
a perfect ketogenic diet food.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.115 align:middle line:84%
It has the perfect
ratios of fats

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:11.327 align:middle line:84%
to proteins to carbs
or fibrous carbs, yeah.

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.954 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.831 align:middle line:90%
OK, so thank you for that.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.041 align:middle line:84%
Just that background, I
think people are already kind

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:19.710 align:middle line:90%
of seeing the benefit here.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.797 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the things
that comes up repeatedly

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.549 align:middle line:90%
is why so much fat?

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:28.177 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did our ancestors
have access to that much fat?

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:31.556 align:middle line:84%
What is it that fat is doing
on a chemical level that

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.350 align:middle line:84%
is allowing this ketone
effect or production?

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.394 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:38.396 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm going to take
a little step back in.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:84%
So when we stop eating,
what our body does

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.734 align:middle line:84%
is immobilize fat from
our adipose tissue.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:46.112 align:middle line:84%
And that fat gets
into our bloodstream

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:47.488 align:middle line:90%
and is used very efficiently.

00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:50.032 align:middle line:84%
The heart runs better off
fat than it does off sugar.

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't know that.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.203 align:middle line:84%
But fatty acids are actually
oxidized quite efficiently

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:55.538 align:middle line:90%
by the heart.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:58.415 align:middle line:84%
The problem with fats
is that they don't

00:15:58.415 --> 00:16:00.334 align:middle line:90%
cross the blood-brain barrier.

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:02.336 align:middle line:84%
So they can't readily
get to the brain.

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:07.341 align:middle line:84%
So when we're fasting, our
body is really running off fat.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:11.929 align:middle line:84%
After the first 48 hours, we
use up our stored carbohydrates

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:84%
in the form of glycogen. So
we're really running off fat.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.684 align:middle line:84%
So that's sort of
more or less the fuel

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:84%
our body is designed to run on,
at least in a fasted situation.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.691 align:middle line:84%
And the ketogenic
diet mimics that.

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:26.485 align:middle line:90%
So it gives your body--

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:29.405 align:middle line:84%
if you're on a ketogenic diet
and you take a blood sample

00:16:29.405 --> 00:16:31.616 align:middle line:84%
and you look at it, it
would look like the person

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.951 align:middle line:90%
is doing a short-term fast.

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.704 align:middle line:84%
It would have that sort
of profile-- low insulin,

00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:90%
low glucose, low inflammation.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Those are all things
associated with fasting.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.922 align:middle line:84%
So the ketogenic
diet, what it does

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:49.759 align:middle line:84%
is it gives the
liver fatty acids.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:53.638 align:middle line:84%
And these fatty
acids are metabolized

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:55.723 align:middle line:90%
at an accelerated rate.

00:16:55.723 --> 00:17:00.394 align:middle line:84%
And when you burn fat at a very
high rate, you make ketones.

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:03.147 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
called acetyl-CoA that's

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:05.066 align:middle line:90%
a breakdown product of fats.

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:07.652 align:middle line:84%
And when the acetyl-CoA
builds up in the liver,

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:10.363 align:middle line:84%
it gets condensed to these
small ketone molecules.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.615 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that can cross
the blood-brain barrier?

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yes.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.742 align:middle line:84%
So ketones are like
water-soluble fat molecules.

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:15.534 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:15.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.743 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:17:16.743 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Whereas fat,
fatty acids are so hydrophobic

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.541 align:middle line:84%
they can't cross the
blood-brain barrier.

00:17:23.541 --> 00:17:24.417 align:middle line:90%
But as a smaller--

00:17:24.417 --> 00:17:26.337 align:middle line:84%
if you chop them up like
a little woodchipper,

00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:90%
you get little small molecules.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.467 align:middle line:84%
And then they can readily
cross the blood-brain barrier

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.844 align:middle line:84%
through a number of
different transporters called

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:35.846 align:middle line:84%
the monocarboxylic
acid transporters.

00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:37.765 align:middle line:84%
And they quickly cross
the blood-brain barrier,

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:41.102 align:middle line:84%
and they can restore and
largely replace glucose

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.603 align:middle line:90%
as a primary fuel.

00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:45.898 align:middle line:84%
And when it does that,
not only are ketones

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:49.026 align:middle line:84%
an alternative energy
source, but now

00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:53.489 align:middle line:84%
we can appreciate, through
publications in science

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:56.492 align:middle line:84%
and in nature medicine, like
high-level publications showing

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:59.245 align:middle line:84%
that ketones can
alter gene expression.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.455 align:middle line:84%
They have what we call
epigenetic effects.

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:04.834 align:middle line:84%
So they active a
genetic program that

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.794 align:middle line:90%
boosts our antioxidant capacity.

00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:12.008 align:middle line:84%
They actually produce a
number of different effects

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:15.261 align:middle line:84%
on antioxidant mechanisms that
are built into our bodies.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.972 align:middle line:84%
We call them endogenous
antioxidant mechanisms.

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:22.893 align:middle line:84%
And it also suppresses
an inflammatory pathway

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:25.354 align:middle line:90%
called the NLRP3 inflammasome.

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:27.523 align:middle line:84%
So I know that's a big
name, but importantly--

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.859 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But in short, it
stops internal inflammation.

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:30.651 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: It is, yeah.

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:31.569 align:middle line:90%
It's like a hub.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.654 align:middle line:84%
And when that
pathway is activated,

00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:37.033 align:middle line:84%
it releases what's called a
lot of inflammatory cytokines.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:41.704 align:middle line:84%
And these cytokines are
associated with pain.

00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:45.791 align:middle line:84%
Many of these cytokines
activate the COX-2 enzyme,

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:48.461 align:middle line:84%
and that's the very
enzyme that things like

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:90%
ibuprofen and Naprosyn target.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.425 align:middle line:84%
So our own body makes
an endogenous metabolite

00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:58.095 align:middle line:84%
that prevents that inflammatory
molecule from even existing.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:00.389 align:middle line:84%
So if we keep that
at low levels,

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:84%
then even under conditions
of stress or conditions

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.979 align:middle line:84%
where we would
have inflammation--

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.523 align:middle line:84%
you can even go to therapies
like radiation therapy

00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:11.692 align:middle line:84%
or chemo, which cause
lots of inflammation--

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:13.235 align:middle line:84%
when it's combined
with a diet, you

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:16.614 align:middle line:84%
can reduce a lot of side
effects from things or even just

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:17.448 align:middle line:90%
exercise.

00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:20.826 align:middle line:84%
So athletes that follow
ketogenic diet, their levels

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:23.371 align:middle line:90%
of inflammation are much lower.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:28.125 align:middle line:84%
So when I got into this
research, 10 years ago,

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:31.587 align:middle line:84%
we only understood ketones
as an energy molecule,

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:32.797 align:middle line:90%
like a super fuel.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.924 align:middle line:84%
But now we realize
that these metabolites

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:37.718 align:middle line:84%
have really important
signaling effects

00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:40.388 align:middle line:84%
and in ways that we're just
starting to understand,

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:44.725 align:middle line:84%
from the epigenetic level
to very powerful suppressors

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:48.104 align:middle line:84%
of inflammatory pathways
that are associated

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.981 align:middle line:84%
with age-related chronic
diseases associated

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:53.609 align:middle line:84%
with autoimmune disorders,
associated with Alzheimer's

00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:55.861 align:middle line:90%
disease, associated with cancer.

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:59.031 align:middle line:84%
So the NLRP3 inflammasome
that I mentioned--

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:02.034 align:middle line:84%
this study was published in
"Nature Medicine," actually.

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:06.455 align:middle line:84%
That inflammasome is associated
with a lot of GI cancers.

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:08.999 align:middle line:84%
So another indication
that being in a state

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.919 align:middle line:84%
of nutritional
ketosis could decrease

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:13.504 align:middle line:90%
some of the inflammation.

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:16.215 align:middle line:84%
And we know gut inflammation
is a huge problem, not

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:84%
just because of the
foods that we eat,

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.763 align:middle line:84%
but our gut is like 70%
of our immune system.

00:20:22.763 --> 00:20:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So if it's chronically
inflamed, it's

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.808 align:middle line:90%
impairing our immune system.

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.393 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let me ask you a
question right here before--

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:90%
and keep your thought.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.937 align:middle line:90%
Hold your thought.

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So I had problems with gluten,
like a lot of people, and just

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.275 align:middle line:90%
kind of an inflamed gut.

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:37.736 align:middle line:84%
So I know a very good
practitioner in the Bay Area

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.947 align:middle line:84%
who was talking about
various things supplementary.

00:20:39.947 --> 00:20:43.701 align:middle line:84%
But one of them was
called COX-2 Tame, right?

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:44.785 align:middle line:90%
COX-2 Tame by Jarrow.

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.912 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they no
longer produce it.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.998 align:middle line:84%
Don't know why, but they
no longer produce it.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.791 align:middle line:84%
Are there other
types of-- are you

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:54.086 align:middle line:84%
saying that ketones in
essence have this same effect?

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.755 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, they have
a remarkable anti-inflammatory

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:58.007 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:20:58.007 --> 00:20:59.967 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot
of plant-based things

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:02.011 align:middle line:84%
that are out there that
need to be studied.

00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:04.472 align:middle line:84%
But as you know, the money
for doing these studies

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:05.639 align:middle line:90%
are limited.

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:10.144 align:middle line:84%
But you know I will
kind of say this.

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:12.855 align:middle line:84%
When the paper
came out at Yale--

00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:16.317 align:middle line:84%
and I was the researcher that
made the diet that they used

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:19.487 align:middle line:84%
at Yale to run this study that
published in "Nature Medicine"

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.405 align:middle line:84%
showing the
anti-inflammatory effects--

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:24.742 align:middle line:84%
the pharmaceutical companies
became intensely interested.

00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:25.576 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I bet.

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:28.829 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And I got
e-mails from the biggest

00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:31.624 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutical companies
out there, saying,

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:38.714 align:middle line:84%
can you tell us what are
the druggable targets

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:41.175 align:middle line:84%
that the ketogenic
diet works through?

00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:44.929 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to
mimic, because ketones

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:47.598 align:middle line:84%
work through specific
pathways, but they also

00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:51.685 align:middle line:84%
work energetically through many
different pathways in synergy.

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:53.187 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
know diet works,

00:21:53.187 --> 00:21:54.772 align:middle line:84%
and that's how we
know exercise works.

00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:56.273 align:middle line:84%
It's affecting all
these different--

00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:57.608 align:middle line:90%
you can't take an exercise pill.

00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:58.776 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard.

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.611 align:middle line:90%
They're never going to make it.

00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:04.573 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beauty of
the ketogenic diet, I think.

00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:09.119 align:middle line:84%
It mimics this
metabolic physiology

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:12.331 align:middle line:84%
that we would achieve during
fasting, short-term fasting,

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.625 align:middle line:84%
which we know has
a lot of benefits.

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:17.169 align:middle line:84%
But it has many
other benefits, too.

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.797 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we knew for a
decade now that it's

00:22:19.797 --> 00:22:23.717 align:middle line:84%
a very powerful metabolic
therapy for managing

00:22:23.717 --> 00:22:25.427 align:middle line:90%
drug-resistant seizures.

00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:29.431 align:middle line:84%
When the drugs fail,
the ketogenic diet

00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:32.851 align:middle line:84%
works about 60% to
80% of the time.

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:36.939 align:middle line:84%
And that's remarkable efficacy
when everything else fails.

00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:40.109 align:middle line:84%
And because it works
when all the drugs fail,

00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:42.361 align:middle line:84%
it's working through
a mechanism that's

00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:44.405 align:middle line:84%
independent of
all the mechanisms

00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:46.532 align:middle line:84%
that the drugs are
working through,

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:47.866 align:middle line:90%
or many mechanisms in synergy.

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:49.243 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In a more
holistic manner, yeah.

00:22:49.243 --> 00:22:50.035 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:52.371 align:middle line:84%
And we should have
known this, but when

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:55.332 align:middle line:84%
you have-- the etiology of
epilepsy is largely unknown.

00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:57.334 align:middle line:84%
Like we were talking
about that, right?

00:22:57.334 --> 00:23:02.089 align:middle line:84%
But it is kind of a breakdown
of the brain's electrical energy

00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:04.049 align:middle line:90%
and its metabolism.

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And if the diet is
restoring that for epilepsy,

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.889 align:middle line:84%
well, you would think that
by enhancing brain energy

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:84%
metabolism, it would
have applications

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.019 align:middle line:84%
for all these other
neurological disorders simply

00:23:15.019 --> 00:23:19.481 align:middle line:84%
by enhancing ATP production
in the very cells that

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:22.151 align:middle line:90%
allow us to think, the neurons.

00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:23.777 align:middle line:84%
And that's my
background of study.

00:23:23.777 --> 00:23:24.653 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:27.031 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: So now
science kind of realized

00:23:27.031 --> 00:23:28.949 align:middle line:90%
the application here.

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:32.536 align:middle line:84%
So now there's research going
all over the globe looking

00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:38.083 align:middle line:84%
at the neuroprotective,
perhaps preventative strategies

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:41.795 align:middle line:84%
using nutritional ketosis
and ketone supplementation.

00:23:41.795 --> 00:23:44.798 align:middle line:84%
Just today there was
a study published

00:23:44.798 --> 00:23:48.177 align:middle line:84%
with a ketone ester that
was developed at NIH

00:23:48.177 --> 00:23:49.845 align:middle line:84%
and studied at
Oxford University,

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:53.140 align:middle line:84%
showing cognitive enhancement
and performance-enhancement

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.809 align:middle line:90%
effects of the ketone ester.

00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:57.019 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:59.396 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And it's
very similar to an ester

00:23:59.396 --> 00:24:01.732 align:middle line:84%
that we're studying
but from another group.

00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what's
interesting, too,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.444 align:middle line:84%
just on the ground
is a lot of people

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:10.783 align:middle line:84%
who are overweight turn to
the HCG diet, which in effect,

00:24:10.783 --> 00:24:15.079 align:middle line:84%
minus the fats initially,
was a ketogenic diet, which

00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:16.205 align:middle line:90%
they found out about later.

00:24:16.205 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, it
puts you into ketosis.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
puts you into ketosis,

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.750 align:middle line:84%
but for an extended
period of time.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I've noticed with people

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.505 align:middle line:84%
besides the fact that, of
course, they lost weight

00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:27.299 align:middle line:84%
rapidly, is
inflammation in the body

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.467 align:middle line:90%
started going away with it.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:30.803 align:middle line:84%
I know a few women that
did it, and-- boom--

00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:32.846 align:middle line:84%
any kind of issues in
their hands, carpal tunnel,

00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:35.641 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff just
disappeared as a byproduct

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:37.851 align:middle line:84%
of going on their
weight-loss program.

00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:38.894 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:39.687 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the other area--
that does not have a lot of fat.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.026 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, that
has to be somehow

00:24:46.026 --> 00:24:48.278 align:middle line:90%
insufficient for the long term.

00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:50.531 align:middle line:84%
And it would not have
created, I'm guessing,

00:24:50.531 --> 00:24:54.702 align:middle line:90%
the same kind of brain support.

00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:57.371 align:middle line:84%
Because I noticed a lot
of grouchiness going along

00:24:57.371 --> 00:24:59.164 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of the
people that were on it.

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:00.416 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: It depends,
yeah, from the hypoglycemia.

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.209 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From hypoglycemia
and not a lot of fats.

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:03.919 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't working too
well on that level,

00:25:03.919 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle line:90%
but the body was dropping fat.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.591 align:middle line:84%
So on that, would you say
just to forget the HCG,

00:25:09.591 --> 00:25:11.593 align:middle line:84%
just go on a standard
ketogenic diet?

00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah,
that's a very--

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.764 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you brought
that observation up.

00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:20.060 align:middle line:10%
Because you can achieve ketosis
through fasting or calorie

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.105 align:middle line:10%
restriction, which
is the HCG diet

00:25:23.105 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:10%
or in isocaloric
or eucaloric, which

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.819 align:middle line:10%
means you're giving your
body all the calorie

00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:31.613 align:middle line:10%
it needs to sustain
growth and metabolism,

00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:35.367 align:middle line:10%
a eucaloric ketogenic
diet, which is high in fat.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:38.662 align:middle line:84%
So if we take a step
back, the HCG diet--

00:25:38.662 --> 00:25:42.708 align:middle line:84%
so HCG, we don't really
know how it works,

00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:44.251 align:middle line:90%
human chorionic gonadotropin.

00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:47.546 align:middle line:84%
So we think it tells the brain
that it's somewhat satiated,

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:50.382 align:middle line:84%
and it helps to preserve some
of the hormones associated

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:53.552 align:middle line:84%
with our metabolism, but
that's kind of a messy area.

00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:57.848 align:middle line:84%
And although my background is
neuropharmacology and neuro

00:25:57.848 --> 00:26:00.976 align:middle line:84%
control of autonomic regulation,
I still don't fundamentally

00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:02.311 align:middle line:90%
understand how it works.

00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:04.438 align:middle line:84%
And the science is
kind of lacking,

00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:06.440 align:middle line:84%
but when you talk to
people, they're like, yeah,

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.108 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have an appetite.

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:12.446 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that the
benefits of calorie restriction

00:26:12.446 --> 00:26:14.323 align:middle line:84%
are all the things that
you mentioned, right?

00:26:14.323 --> 00:26:18.577 align:middle line:84%
So the calorie restriction will
keep your metabolism going.

00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:20.746 align:middle line:84%
If protein is
sufficient, it's still

00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:22.748 align:middle line:90%
allowing your body to repair.

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:24.208 align:middle line:84%
Like your nails
will keep growing,

00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:27.085 align:middle line:84%
your hair will keep
growing, everything.

00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:31.799 align:middle line:84%
And it also causes your body
to mobilize fat for energy.

00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:34.134 align:middle line:84%
So even though you're
getting calories,

00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:36.762 align:middle line:84%
and it could be like only
500 to 1,000 calories,

00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:39.181 align:middle line:84%
depending on the diet,
the primary source

00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:41.058 align:middle line:84%
of energy that
your body is using

00:26:41.058 --> 00:26:44.645 align:middle line:84%
is actually stored fat
from adipose tissue.

00:26:44.645 --> 00:26:49.525 align:middle line:84%
So that's being released, but
it may not be to the extent

00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:52.569 align:middle line:84%
or to the degree that would be
achieved with a ketogenic diet.

00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:54.279 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
allow for your brain

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.864 align:middle line:84%
to continue functioning
optimally, for example.

00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:57.157 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: To make ketones.

00:26:57.157 --> 00:26:59.952 align:middle line:84%
Because ketones
are made from fat,

00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:04.498 align:middle line:84%
but if you are feeding yourself
too much protein or too much

00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:84%
carbohydrates especially, that
causes a release of insulin,

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.965 align:middle line:84%
and that insulin can shut
off the ketogenic process

00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:14.258 align:middle line:90%
in the liver.

00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:16.176 align:middle line:90%
So we call that ketogenesis.

00:27:16.176 --> 00:27:20.222 align:middle line:84%
And if I fasted a
whole week, my ketones

00:27:20.222 --> 00:27:23.183 align:middle line:84%
would be sky high, like
5 millimolar level.

00:27:23.183 --> 00:27:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you injected
me with insulin,

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.895 align:middle line:84%
my body would stop
producing ketones,

00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:31.775 align:middle line:84%
and I would go hypoglycemic
for a period of time.

00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:33.986 align:middle line:90%
But the hypoglycemia would be--

00:27:33.986 --> 00:27:35.988 align:middle line:84%
I would be sort of protected
because you'd still

00:27:35.988 --> 00:27:38.115 align:middle line:84%
have ketones floating
around in your system.

00:27:38.115 --> 00:27:41.076 align:middle line:84%
So when you're on a
calorie-restricted diet

00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:44.705 align:middle line:84%
and it's giving
your body energy,

00:27:44.705 --> 00:27:48.041 align:middle line:84%
you go hypoglycemic at
periods of time, right?

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:49.877 align:middle line:84%
Because your body
releases insulin, and then

00:27:49.877 --> 00:27:51.169 align:middle line:90%
your blood sugar drops.

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not making
sufficient amount of ketones,

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.509 align:middle line:84%
that hypoglycemia is
going to cause a reaction,

00:27:57.509 --> 00:28:00.095 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to get hungry,
you're going to get irritated.

00:28:00.095 --> 00:28:00.929 align:middle line:90%
You get brain fog.

00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:01.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:03.974 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Whereas if you
keep your ketones sufficiently

00:28:03.974 --> 00:28:06.935 align:middle line:84%
elevated, that gives you
tremendous resilience

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:10.272 align:middle line:84%
against hypoglycemia because
it's feeding your brain energy.

00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:12.065 align:middle line:84%
Your brain says, I
have plenty of energy.

00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:12.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.776 align:middle line:84%
I can think and
do and my hormones

00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:19.448 align:middle line:84%
are not regulated because the
energy status is up there.

00:28:19.448 --> 00:28:21.533 align:middle line:84%
Now, the HCG may
help a little bit

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:24.036 align:middle line:84%
with restoring or
maintaining those hormones

00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:84%
in a calorie deficit, and it
may be working through that way.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.956 align:middle line:84%
But I can't really
comment on that.

00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:29.082 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you said, this
is your field of research

00:28:29.082 --> 00:28:31.001 align:middle line:84%
and you don't understand
it that well, either.

00:28:31.001 --> 00:28:33.086 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: But I know
that ketogenic diet tends

00:28:33.086 --> 00:28:35.631 align:middle line:84%
to work remarkably
well if-- you might

00:28:35.631 --> 00:28:37.925 align:middle line:84%
get a double benefit if
you have a ketogenic diet

00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:39.635 align:middle line:90%
and it's calorie-restricted.

00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:42.554 align:middle line:84%
Because it's giving
your body ketones

00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:90%
and you're hypoglycemic.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.017 align:middle line:84%
And hypoglycemia sounds
like a bad thing,

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:49.811 align:middle line:84%
but if you're hypoglycemic
and your ketones are high,

00:28:49.811 --> 00:28:52.481 align:middle line:84%
that basically means you're
burning a lot of fat.

00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:55.525 align:middle line:84%
And you will achieve your
fat-loss goals a lot faster,

00:28:55.525 --> 00:29:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and the ketones help to
preserve brain homeostasis

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.907 align:middle line:90%
in general and your hormones.

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:04.034 align:middle line:84%
So if you get
calories down to low,

00:29:04.034 --> 00:29:05.827 align:middle line:84%
then you could start
influencing things

00:29:05.827 --> 00:29:09.581 align:middle line:84%
like your sympathetic
nervous system, your thyroid,

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and your body temperature
starts to drop.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.169 align:middle line:84%
And that will take time to
restore your metabolism.

00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So you have to keep
the calories up.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.299 align:middle line:84%
And you can cycle, and there's
different ways to do that.

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:22.761 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
going back to ketones

00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:24.554 align:middle line:84%
and looking in terms
of chronic disease

00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:28.392 align:middle line:84%
and particularly cancer, one of
the things the medical industry

00:29:28.392 --> 00:29:30.936 align:middle line:84%
has had a difficult time with,
as I was reading in your book,

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:33.271 align:middle line:90%
is there's this confusion.

00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:38.235 align:middle line:84%
The word "ketones" is
confused with ketoacidosis.

00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:41.238 align:middle line:84%
And so the medical industry,
if you have elevated ketones,

00:29:41.238 --> 00:29:43.657 align:middle line:84%
it's like, oh, no,
this is terrible.

00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:46.576 align:middle line:84%
You're breaking
down, your health

00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:47.786 align:middle line:90%
is breaking down and whatnot.

00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.705 align:middle line:90%
There's just a misunderstanding.

00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.581 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain why
the medical industry

00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:56.420 align:middle line:84%
has been so pitched against
the notion of ketogenics?

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.088 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: That's
a great question,

00:29:58.088 --> 00:30:00.841 align:middle line:84%
because I get that at
every clinical conference

00:30:00.841 --> 00:30:03.301 align:middle line:84%
that I speak at, and I get
that from the medical students

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:05.137 align:middle line:84%
that I teach, too,
because they're

00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:08.724 align:middle line:90%
taught that ketosis is bad.

00:30:08.724 --> 00:30:10.475 align:middle line:84%
That's all they know,
that ketones are bad.

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:14.229 align:middle line:84%
They are a byproduct of
metabolic dysregulation.

00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:16.273 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much
all they're taught.

00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:18.108 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very
distinct difference

00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:21.778 align:middle line:84%
between nutritional ketosis
and fasting ketosis.

00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:24.031 align:middle line:84%
But let's just stick
with nutritional ketosis

00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:29.369 align:middle line:84%
and diabetic ketoacidosis or
alcoholic ketoacidosis, which

00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:31.663 align:middle line:84%
happens if you drink too much
alcohol if you're fasted.

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:34.291 align:middle line:84%
So let's stick with
diabetic ketoacidosis

00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:36.877 align:middle line:84%
because that's where the
negative connotations come

00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:37.794 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:30:37.794 --> 00:30:41.882 align:middle line:84%
And that occurs only
under conditions

00:30:41.882 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:84%
with the absence of insulin,
which would be type 1 diabetes.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.345 align:middle line:84%
So in type 1 diabetes,
the body doesn't

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:49.264 align:middle line:90%
produce its own insulin.

00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:55.228 align:middle line:84%
And if we go into a state
of ketosis, what typically

00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:57.189 align:middle line:84%
happens, because we're
not producing insulin,

00:30:57.189 --> 00:31:00.776 align:middle line:84%
our glucose is sky
high, but our body

00:31:00.776 --> 00:31:03.904 align:middle line:84%
doesn't sense that we have any
glucose because the insulin is

00:31:03.904 --> 00:31:06.031 align:middle line:90%
not there to push it into cells.

00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:09.993 align:middle line:84%
So it starts making ketones as
sort of a fail-safe mechanism.

00:31:09.993 --> 00:31:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But because the
insulin is not there,

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.372 align:middle line:84%
and I told you
insulin is associated

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:18.627 align:middle line:84%
with regulating
ketone production,

00:31:18.627 --> 00:31:20.921 align:middle line:84%
you have what's
runaway ketogenesis.

00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:23.548 align:middle line:84%
So you have really
high ketones, much,

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:26.343 align:middle line:84%
much higher than you get
on a ketogenic diet, also

00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:28.678 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of
very high glucose.

00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:90%
And that creates an acidosis.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.057 align:middle line:84%
And that can be
life threatening.

00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:32.849 align:middle line:90%
You go into a coma.

00:31:32.849 --> 00:31:33.642 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:34.976 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:38.396 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Interestingly
there's-- so you would think

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:41.525 align:middle line:84%
the ketogenic diet would be
the worst thing you could do

00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:43.276 align:middle line:90%
for type 1 diabetes.

00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:48.198 align:middle line:84%
But there is a book by
a doctor in Sarasota,

00:31:48.198 --> 00:31:50.367 align:middle line:84%
near where I live
in Tampa, Dr. Keith

00:31:50.367 --> 00:31:54.579 align:middle line:84%
Runyon, who has a book "The
Ketogenic Diet for Type 1

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:55.497 align:middle line:90%
Diabetes."

00:31:55.497 --> 00:31:58.083 align:middle line:84%
And he's a medical doctor
and he runs triathlons.

00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:03.171 align:middle line:84%
And one of my stellar
PhD students that I have

00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:04.589 align:middle line:90%
is a type 1 diabetic.

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:10.595 align:middle line:84%
And following a ketogenic diet
allows him to use about a third

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.097 align:middle line:84%
of the insulin he
would otherwise

00:32:12.097 --> 00:32:13.765 align:middle line:90%
use on a high-carb diet.

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.642 align:middle line:84%
And he's always
chasing his glucose

00:32:15.642 --> 00:32:18.228 align:middle line:84%
by injecting insulin
on a high-carb diet,

00:32:18.228 --> 00:32:22.983 align:middle line:84%
whereas a low-carb ketogenic
diet, his insulin needs

00:32:22.983 --> 00:32:24.526 align:middle line:90%
are much, much lower.

00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:28.572 align:middle line:84%
And his glucose, instead
of going like this all day,

00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:32.492 align:middle line:84%
it basically just goes like this
all day with low-carb meals.

00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:36.454 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to have
tremendous benefit for him

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:37.372 align:middle line:90%
for longevity.

00:32:37.372 --> 00:32:40.167 align:middle line:84%
Because those glucose
spikes that he's

00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:42.752 align:middle line:84%
getting on a
high-carb diet, even

00:32:42.752 --> 00:32:45.505 align:middle line:84%
trying to manage his insulin--
he wears a constant glucose

00:32:45.505 --> 00:32:49.092 align:middle line:84%
monitor, so we can download
all the data for the whole week

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.302 align:middle line:90%
and see it.

00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:53.013 align:middle line:84%
And it's like night
and day, his glucose

00:32:53.013 --> 00:32:55.807 align:middle line:84%
control with a
low-carb ketogenic diet

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:58.977 align:middle line:90%
versus the high-carb diet.

00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:06.234 align:middle line:84%
And so the negative kind
of stigma that ketones

00:33:06.234 --> 00:33:09.821 align:middle line:84%
have is associated
with type 1 diabetes.

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.198 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ketoacidosis, yeah.

00:33:11.198 --> 00:33:13.533 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And ketoacidosis
is more likely, actually,

00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:16.411 align:middle line:84%
on a high-carb diet, when you're
trying to chase your blood

00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:19.080 align:middle line:84%
glucose with boluses of
insulin, which could--

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.457 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's what they're

00:33:20.457 --> 00:33:21.958 align:middle line:90%
trained in in medical school.

00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:22.751 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:33:22.751 --> 00:33:24.336 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
that makes sense.

00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:28.215 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: They treat
hyperglycemia with more insulin

00:33:28.215 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:90%
instead of managing--

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and type 2 diabetes is
carbohydrate intolerance.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.643 align:middle line:84%
And they're using a carb-based
diet to manage type 2 diabetes.

00:33:39.643 --> 00:33:41.353 align:middle line:84%
So you would want to
restrict your carbs.

00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:41.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know
a couple of people

00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:44.981 align:middle line:84%
who have type 2 diabetes that
have gone on paleo or more

00:33:44.981 --> 00:33:46.650 align:middle line:84%
ketogetic-type
diets and-- boom--

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.818 align:middle line:84%
they start feeling better,
everything's reduced.

00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:49.861 align:middle line:90%
All symptoms are reduced.

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.738 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Puts you into
remission in a week or two.

00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.658 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: I just
came from a conference.

00:33:54.658 --> 00:33:58.245 align:middle line:84%
One doctor after another is
showing a hard data on this.

00:33:58.245 --> 00:34:02.457 align:middle line:84%
And it's by far the
most effective way

00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:05.126 align:middle line:84%
to metabolically
manage type 2 diabetes.

00:34:05.126 --> 00:34:07.003 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can get
them off insulin.

00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:08.755 align:middle line:84%
In a severe case,
they're using insulin,

00:34:08.755 --> 00:34:11.424 align:middle line:84%
and you can pretty much
get everybody off insulin

00:34:11.424 --> 00:34:12.926 align:middle line:90%
within two or three weeks.

00:34:12.926 --> 00:34:13.969 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pretty amazing.

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:15.387 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Sometimes
even the first week.

00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:16.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd think that
would be mainstream information

00:34:16.763 --> 00:34:17.847 align:middle line:90%
by now for sure.

00:34:17.847 --> 00:34:19.556 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: If a
drug worked like that,

00:34:19.556 --> 00:34:21.141 align:middle line:90%
it would you a blockbuster.

00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:22.893 align:middle line:84%
It would be a
billion-dollar drug.

00:34:22.893 --> 00:34:24.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
requires effort.

00:34:24.353 --> 00:34:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Metformin works,
but no amount of metformin

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:84%
could match the effects
of a ketogenic diet

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.610 align:middle line:90%
for controlling type 2 diabetes.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.404 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:34.155 align:middle line:84%
So let's go from
diabetes to cancer

00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:36.116 align:middle line:84%
and specifically
talk about ketones

00:34:36.116 --> 00:34:39.744 align:middle line:84%
in cancer, which Dr. Donese
Worden, who you know and works

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:42.455 align:middle line:84%
alongside you in certain ways,
is using this with her clients

00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:43.415 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:34:43.415 --> 00:34:47.543 align:middle line:84%
So the place of
ketones in this story?

00:34:47.543 --> 00:34:52.299 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: OK, so
in regards to cancer,

00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:57.220 align:middle line:84%
cancer is very unique in
its metabolic signature

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:01.975 align:middle line:84%
or its metabolic, we
call, phenotype, right?

00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:05.854 align:middle line:84%
Cancers can arise from an
array of different things.

00:35:05.854 --> 00:35:07.022 align:middle line:90%
There's chemicals.

00:35:07.022 --> 00:35:08.732 align:middle line:90%
There's radiation.

00:35:08.732 --> 00:35:12.986 align:middle line:84%
Even genes could cause it, and
our diet influences our genes,

00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:14.154 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:35:14.154 --> 00:35:18.116 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at all different
types of cancers, what's

00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:23.163 align:middle line:84%
very similar is that they're
genetically heterogeneous,

00:35:23.163 --> 00:35:26.333 align:middle line:84%
which means coming
up with a therapy

00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:30.795 align:middle line:84%
to manage cancer that's a gene
therapy is highly unlikely.

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:35.300 align:middle line:84%
If you take glioblastoma
multiforme, for example--

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.886 align:middle line:84%
hence the name multiforme--
you have multiple types

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:40.764 align:middle line:90%
of cells in the same tumor.

00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:46.186 align:middle line:84%
So you can have up to
1,000 different mutations

00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:49.397 align:middle line:90%
in the exact same tumor.

00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:53.234 align:middle line:84%
So one cell can have a
completely different set

00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:58.531 align:middle line:84%
of mutations than a cell 300
or 400 microns away from it

00:35:58.531 --> 00:35:59.574 align:middle line:90%
in the actual tumor.

00:35:59.574 --> 00:36:02.494 align:middle line:84%
So how are you going to
develop a therapy to do that?

00:36:02.494 --> 00:36:05.038 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
genetically heterogeneous,

00:36:05.038 --> 00:36:08.083 align:middle line:84%
but they're metabolically
very homogeneous.

00:36:08.083 --> 00:36:14.005 align:middle line:84%
So they have very similar
metabolic phenotype

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:17.842 align:middle line:84%
in that they have excessive
rates of glucose consumption.

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:20.345 align:middle line:84%
And because their
mitochondria are

00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:24.224 align:middle line:90%
damaged in most cancer cells--

00:36:24.224 --> 00:36:26.726 align:middle line:84%
and I say that because
of all the studies

00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:29.604 align:middle line:84%
that have been done
on cancer so far,

00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:34.692 align:middle line:84%
not one study has shown that
cancer has normal mitochondria.

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:36.444 align:middle line:84%
So the mitochondria
of cancer cells

00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:40.323 align:middle line:84%
are abnormal in some
way, shape, or form.

00:36:40.323 --> 00:36:44.661 align:middle line:84%
One of the key factors
in mitochondrial health--

00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:47.622 align:middle line:84%
and we're really as healthy
as our mitochondria, right?

00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.625 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: So I'll just
kind of interject that.

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:84%
But one of the key
things associated

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.755 align:middle line:84%
with mitochondrial health is a
substance called cardiolipin.

00:36:55.755 --> 00:36:58.591 align:middle line:84%
And it makes up the inner
mitochondrial membrane.

00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:01.261 align:middle line:84%
And that membrane of
the inner mitochondria

00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:03.471 align:middle line:84%
is actually where
ATP is being made.

00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:07.725 align:middle line:84%
And it factors in for
the structural integrity

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.102 align:middle line:90%
of the mitochondria.

00:37:09.102 --> 00:37:11.688 align:middle line:90%
And cancer cells lack--

00:37:11.688 --> 00:37:14.357 align:middle line:84%
they have this-- it's
like immature cardiolipin.

00:37:14.357 --> 00:37:17.444 align:middle line:84%
And it's a molecule
that's formed,

00:37:17.444 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and then it kind of matures
and is regulated in a way

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.826 align:middle line:84%
and built up in a way
to become a functional

00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:27.454 align:middle line:84%
correlate or a constituent
of the inner mitochondrial

00:37:27.454 --> 00:37:28.246 align:middle line:90%
membrane.

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:30.457 align:middle line:84%
And all of cancer cells
that have been studied

00:37:30.457 --> 00:37:32.459 align:middle line:84%
are deficient in
this cardiolipin.

00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:36.921 align:middle line:84%
And that causes
cancer cells to have

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:41.426 align:middle line:84%
an impairment in their
ability to use mitochondrian

00:37:41.426 --> 00:37:43.303 align:middle line:90%
fuel for energy.

00:37:43.303 --> 00:37:46.473 align:middle line:84%
So we know that ketones
are metabolized exclusively

00:37:46.473 --> 00:37:49.309 align:middle line:84%
in the mitochondria
to create ATP,

00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:53.521 align:middle line:84%
whereas in glycolysis, our sugar
metabolism occurs independent

00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:55.857 align:middle line:90%
of the mitochondria.

00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:59.986 align:middle line:84%
You can have glucose oxidation,
but the glycolytic pathway

00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:02.113 align:middle line:90%
is outside of the mitochondria.

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:04.032 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
cancer cells use.

00:38:04.032 --> 00:38:07.327 align:middle line:84%
They actually ferment
the glucose to lactate.

00:38:07.327 --> 00:38:11.331 align:middle line:84%
And on the surface it looks
like an inefficient energetic

00:38:11.331 --> 00:38:12.415 align:middle line:90%
pathway.

00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:15.877 align:middle line:84%
But cancer cells
use this pathway

00:38:15.877 --> 00:38:19.672 align:middle line:84%
for their own purpose
to shuttle metabolites

00:38:19.672 --> 00:38:22.175 align:middle line:84%
into the expanding
biomass of the tumor.

00:38:22.175 --> 00:38:25.803 align:middle line:84%
And it causes the tumor
cells to excrete lactate.

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:28.139 align:middle line:84%
And you get a very
acid environment.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:28.556 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The lactic acid, yeah.

00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:29.349 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:32.268 align:middle line:84%
So that acidic
environment of the tumor

00:38:32.268 --> 00:38:35.188 align:middle line:84%
is basically causing
a destruction

00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:38.900 align:middle line:84%
of the normal cells around
it and causing inflammation.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.862 align:middle line:84%
And it's more of a consequence
rather than a cause.

00:38:42.862 --> 00:38:47.325 align:middle line:84%
And I understand that
there's an alkalizing diet.

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.202 align:middle line:90%
And that could help to a degree.

00:38:49.202 --> 00:38:52.247 align:middle line:84%
But really the acidic
environment of a tumor

00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:54.916 align:middle line:84%
is a consequence of the
damage to mitochondria,

00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:58.336 align:middle line:84%
which could occur from
poor diet, inflammation.

00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:03.591 align:middle line:84%
We know radiation is a fantastic
way to induce tumors, chemo.

00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:04.884 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stress-- just stress.

00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:05.009 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Stress.

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:07.178 align:middle line:84%
And chemotherapy drugs
damage the mitochondria.

00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:08.346 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:09.973 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: So
there's a variety of--

00:39:09.973 --> 00:39:10.765 align:middle line:90%
even viruses.

00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:14.561 align:middle line:84%
So the viruses that cause
cancer that we know of,

00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:18.523 align:middle line:84%
they do impact DNA in
the nuclear genome.

00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:21.526 align:middle line:84%
But they have more
of a stronger impact

00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:23.653 align:middle line:90%
on the DNA in the mitochondria.

00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:25.655 align:middle line:84%
And mitochondria
have their own DNA.

00:39:25.655 --> 00:39:28.408 align:middle line:84%
And the coding
regions of that DNA

00:39:28.408 --> 00:39:31.202 align:middle line:84%
are much more dense than the
coding regions in the nuclear.

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:34.455 align:middle line:84%
And DNA repair mechanisms
in the mitochondria

00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:37.792 align:middle line:84%
are nowhere near as
robust as the nucleus.

00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:43.673 align:middle line:84%
So if you throw chemical
agents at a cell,

00:39:43.673 --> 00:39:47.051 align:middle line:84%
it's more likely to
damage mitochondrial DNA

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:48.303 align:middle line:90%
than nuclear DNA.

00:39:48.303 --> 00:39:49.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:51.806 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And the
mitochondria's energy

00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:56.144 align:middle line:84%
is essential for the
nuclear DNA to create

00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:57.645 align:middle line:90%
that genomic stability.

00:39:57.645 --> 00:40:00.648 align:middle line:84%
So the nucleus has DNA, but
it's constantly being repaired.

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:03.026 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
energetic pathway.

00:40:03.026 --> 00:40:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And if the energy systems
of the cell go down,

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:10.742 align:middle line:84%
the ATP levels go down, then
the nucleus of the cell cannot

00:40:10.742 --> 00:40:12.201 align:middle line:90%
repair its own DNA.

00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:14.871 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, that's
called genomic instability,

00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:19.459 align:middle line:84%
and that kicks on oncogenes
that transform a normal cell

00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:20.918 align:middle line:90%
into a cancer cell.

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:23.546 align:middle line:84%
So that in a nutshell is the
metabolic theory of cancer.

00:40:23.546 --> 00:40:25.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, people
will have to go back over

00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:27.091 align:middle line:84%
and listen to this
two or three times

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and take notes and look
things up, Google it.

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:29.802 align:middle line:90%
But thank you.

00:40:29.802 --> 00:40:31.763 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: It's
described in a 300-page book

00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:33.514 align:middle line:84%
by my colleague-- or
maybe 400-page book

00:40:33.514 --> 00:40:35.850 align:middle line:84%
by my colleague Dr.
Thomas Seyfried.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:39.187 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it
referenced with like 1,000

00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:41.189 align:middle line:84%
different references--
literally 1,000--

00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:44.275 align:middle line:84%
but all the elegant experiments
that lead up to this,

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:47.403 align:middle line:84%
he compiled it into one
source that you can look at.

00:40:47.403 --> 00:40:49.739 align:middle line:84%
And Travis
Christoffersen's book,

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:53.201 align:middle line:84%
"Tripping Over the Truth," is
kind of like a layman's book

00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:55.995 align:middle line:84%
that outlines it in a
very elegant story that

00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:57.288 align:middle line:90%
has a powerful narrative to it.

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.498 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He did
a wonderful job.

00:40:58.498 --> 00:40:58.831 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:40:58.831 --> 00:41:01.459 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very compelling
story that outlines this.

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:05.546 align:middle line:84%
And now when I got into
this six, seven years ago,

00:41:05.546 --> 00:41:08.466 align:middle line:84%
really into like hardcore
cancer research--

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:10.635 align:middle line:84%
but let's just go
back 10 years ago--

00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:14.013 align:middle line:84%
there was no cancer
metabolism conferences.

00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:18.226 align:middle line:84%
Now you have tumor
metabolism conferences.

00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:21.145 align:middle line:90%
So the Warburg effect is being--

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:24.691 align:middle line:84%
or what I was just describing,
cancer cells using excess sugar

00:41:24.691 --> 00:41:26.776 align:middle line:84%
metabolism to fuel their
growth and proliferation--

00:41:26.776 --> 00:41:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Credited
to Otto Warburg.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.487 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: --is called
the Warburg effect.

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.531 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Seyfried
writes about it,

00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:35.159 align:middle line:84%
and Travis Christofferson
talked about it in his book.

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:39.455 align:middle line:84%
So now the mainstream
cancer community

00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:43.292 align:middle line:84%
acknowledges finally that
the Warburg effect is real

00:41:43.292 --> 00:41:47.505 align:middle line:84%
and that cancer cells,
pretty much in 90% or more,

00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:49.841 align:middle line:90%
exhibit this Warburg effect.

00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:52.051 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that don't
are slow-growing cancers

00:41:52.051 --> 00:41:56.556 align:middle line:84%
that we really don't have to
pay much attention to anyway.

00:41:56.556 --> 00:41:59.016 align:middle line:84%
They acknowledge that
the Warburg effect

00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:03.062 align:middle line:84%
is a phenomenon in cancer
cells and that it's

00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:06.566 align:middle line:84%
the basis for the
FDG PET scan, which

00:42:06.566 --> 00:42:09.902 align:middle line:84%
is like the gold standard
of identifying the location

00:42:09.902 --> 00:42:12.238 align:middle line:84%
and aggressiveness
of tumor cells.

00:42:12.238 --> 00:42:17.785 align:middle line:84%
What they don't agree upon
is what caused normal cells

00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:22.165 align:middle line:84%
to transform into cancer cells
and this elusive enabling

00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:23.332 align:middle line:90%
factor.

00:42:23.332 --> 00:42:29.547 align:middle line:84%
And this is called
the oncogenic paradox,

00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:31.924 align:middle line:84%
which Albert Szent
Gyorgyi, a Hungarian,

00:42:31.924 --> 00:42:33.301 align:middle line:90%
kind of developed this.

00:42:33.301 --> 00:42:35.803 align:middle line:84%
And the metabolic
theory of cancer

00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:37.847 align:middle line:84%
solves the oncogenic
paradox, that you

00:42:37.847 --> 00:42:40.808 align:middle line:84%
could have many different
factors contributing

00:42:40.808 --> 00:42:45.563 align:middle line:84%
to the transformation, the
oncogenic transformation

00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:48.357 align:middle line:84%
of a normal cell
to a cancer cell.

00:42:48.357 --> 00:42:51.652 align:middle line:84%
So if you impact
the mitochondria

00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:55.573 align:middle line:84%
and disable the energetic
status of a cell,

00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:58.951 align:middle line:84%
then the nuclear genome
relies on that energy

00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:02.163 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the fidelity
of the nuclear genome,

00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:04.707 align:middle line:84%
needs energy for the
DNA repair process.

00:43:04.707 --> 00:43:06.209 align:middle line:84%
So if you damage
the mitochondria,

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:07.794 align:middle line:90%
that's the source of the energy.

00:43:07.794 --> 00:43:10.463 align:middle line:84%
And then the nucleus
of the cell basically

00:43:10.463 --> 00:43:14.258 align:middle line:84%
has a stress response, and
it activates these oncogenes.

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:16.677 align:middle line:84%
And the oncogenes
are the genes that

00:43:16.677 --> 00:43:20.723 align:middle line:84%
cause the cell to ramp up its
sugar metabolism for survival.

00:43:20.723 --> 00:43:23.309 align:middle line:84%
So it's like this
fail-safe mechanism

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:24.685 align:middle line:90%
hardwired into our evolution.

00:43:24.685 --> 00:43:25.436 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To protect itself.

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:26.771 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: To protect itself.

00:43:26.771 --> 00:43:30.525 align:middle line:84%
And the immune system is
going haywire, usually.

00:43:30.525 --> 00:43:33.903 align:middle line:84%
So the cancer kind
of becomes an entity

00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:37.448 align:middle line:84%
that's even outside it-- it
has its own sort of agenda,

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:38.241 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:39.116 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Outside of the
rest of the organism.

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:42.578 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And it's growing
independent of the organism.

00:43:42.578 --> 00:43:47.625 align:middle line:84%
And there's an interesting
discussion by Dr. Paul Davies.

00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:49.126 align:middle line:90%
He's actually a cosmologist.

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.044 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:43:50.044 --> 00:43:51.838 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: A very
interesting character.

00:43:51.838 --> 00:43:54.507 align:middle line:84%
And he came up with a theory
called the atavistic theory,

00:43:54.507 --> 00:44:00.096 align:middle line:84%
that cancers will revert back
to this ancient genetic program,

00:44:00.096 --> 00:44:04.934 align:middle line:84%
which is deriving energy
from glucose fermentation

00:44:04.934 --> 00:44:06.644 align:middle line:90%
into lactate.

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:07.770 align:middle line:90%
And I think it ties in--

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:10.314 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if all the
aspects of this theory

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:12.275 align:middle line:84%
will hold true with
the experiments that

00:44:12.275 --> 00:44:16.529 align:middle line:84%
need to validate it, but it's a
pretty compelling kind of idea

00:44:16.529 --> 00:44:21.158 align:middle line:84%
that cancer is basically
reverting back to--

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:25.413 align:middle line:84%
activating a genetic program
that mimics this sort

00:44:25.413 --> 00:44:29.375 align:middle line:84%
of ancient survival program
that's using a substrate-level

00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:33.170 align:middle line:84%
phosphorylation and glycolysis
to get its energy instead

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:37.216 align:middle line:84%
of mitochondrial, which
is sort of a newer,

00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:39.510 align:middle line:84%
evolutionarily
speaking, form of--

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.846 align:middle line:84%
much more efficient form
of energy production.

00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:44.724 align:middle line:84%
But because the mitochondria
have a limited capacity

00:44:44.724 --> 00:44:49.061 align:middle line:84%
for DNA repair, if
you're drinking alcohol

00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:50.813 align:middle line:84%
or a toxic beverage
over and over,

00:44:50.813 --> 00:44:53.441 align:middle line:84%
you're hitting your liver
with a lot of toxins.

00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:56.944 align:middle line:84%
And it can only repair so much
before some of those cells

00:44:56.944 --> 00:44:58.905 align:middle line:84%
start-- you start to
damage to the mitochondria

00:44:58.905 --> 00:45:02.491 align:middle line:84%
so much that the liver
cells start to transform

00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:05.494 align:middle line:90%
into cancer cells over time.

00:45:05.494 --> 00:45:08.039 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how does the
ketone story come in now?

00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:12.501 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: OK, so ketones are
very unique from an energetic

00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:14.086 align:middle line:90%
perspective in that--

00:45:14.086 --> 00:45:16.422 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that they are
metabolized exclusively

00:45:16.422 --> 00:45:19.467 align:middle line:90%
in the mitochondria for energy.

00:45:19.467 --> 00:45:20.635 align:middle line:90%
And if you have--

00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:25.014 align:middle line:84%
mitochondria in cancer cells are
structurally and biochemically

00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:27.058 align:middle line:90%
deficient, which means--

00:45:27.058 --> 00:45:28.476 align:middle line:84%
I talked about
the cardiolipin is

00:45:28.476 --> 00:45:29.977 align:middle line:90%
deficient in all cancer cells.

00:45:29.977 --> 00:45:32.855 align:middle line:84%
And no studies to
my knowledge have

00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:36.692 align:middle line:84%
shown that cancer cells
taken from a tumor

00:45:36.692 --> 00:45:38.152 align:middle line:90%
have normal mitochondria.

00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:40.905 align:middle line:84%
So they're either deficient
in the number of mitochondria,

00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:44.825 align:middle line:84%
or they're just functionally--
the intermitochondrial membrane

00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:47.745 align:middle line:84%
are all mucked up, and that's
where you're making energy.

00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So one way to exploit the
metabolic derangement of cancer

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.632 align:middle line:84%
is to feed the body metabolic
substrates that normal,

00:45:59.632 --> 00:46:03.636 align:middle line:84%
healthy cells can derive energy
from, but cancer cells can't.

00:46:03.636 --> 00:46:06.555 align:middle line:84%
And nutritional
ketosis does that.

00:46:06.555 --> 00:46:08.474 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Starve them
of their glucose supply.

00:46:08.474 --> 00:46:08.849 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yes.

00:46:08.849 --> 00:46:10.685 align:middle line:84%
So when you're on
a ketogenic diet,

00:46:10.685 --> 00:46:12.687 align:middle line:90%
it does a number of things.

00:46:12.687 --> 00:46:14.772 align:middle line:84%
It suppresses the
hormone insulin.

00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:17.775 align:middle line:84%
And we know insulin is a
huge factor in cancer growth.

00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:22.196 align:middle line:84%
Many of the cells have much
more insulin receptors.

00:46:22.196 --> 00:46:25.491 align:middle line:84%
The insulin drives
different growth factors

00:46:25.491 --> 00:46:29.120 align:middle line:90%
called the mTOR and AMP kinase.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
metabolic signaling associated

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.462 align:middle line:84%
with the ketogenic diet
that drug companies are

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:39.797 align:middle line:90%
trying to target.

00:46:39.797 --> 00:46:43.217 align:middle line:84%
So you have suppression
of insulin, IGF-1.

00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:46.846 align:middle line:84%
AMP kinase is activated,
which is a good thing.

00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:48.097 align:middle line:90%
mTOR is lower.

00:46:48.097 --> 00:46:50.766 align:middle line:84%
All these things
drive cancer growth,

00:46:50.766 --> 00:46:55.312 align:middle line:84%
and they are all profoundly
influenced or suppressed--

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:59.108 align:middle line:84%
minimized in a way that
would minimize cancer growth.

00:46:59.108 --> 00:47:00.276 align:middle line:90%
So on top of that--

00:47:00.276 --> 00:47:00.901 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: WIth the
ketogenic diet.

00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:01.736 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: With
the ketogenic diet.

00:47:01.736 --> 00:47:03.946 align:middle line:84%
And that's underappreciated,
because people just say,

00:47:03.946 --> 00:47:08.451 align:middle line:84%
oh, your glucose goes
down, but my basal glucose

00:47:08.451 --> 00:47:09.368 align:middle line:90%
didn't change much.

00:47:09.368 --> 00:47:11.078 align:middle line:90%
I'm on a ketogenic diet.

00:47:11.078 --> 00:47:13.998 align:middle line:84%
If you're a normal,
healthy adult,

00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:16.125 align:middle line:84%
your fasting glucose
may not change much

00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:20.129 align:middle line:84%
on a ketogenic diet, but when
you eat a ketogenic diet meal,

00:47:20.129 --> 00:47:24.425 align:middle line:84%
your insulin may do a little bit
of a little blip in elevation,

00:47:24.425 --> 00:47:27.678 align:middle line:84%
but if you eat a healthy,
high-carbohydrate meal,

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:30.181 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a
big spike in your insulin.

00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:32.475 align:middle line:84%
And it's those
post-prandial spikes

00:47:32.475 --> 00:47:35.102 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with a
lot of the negative effects

00:47:35.102 --> 00:47:38.022 align:middle line:84%
of high insulin, which is
inflammation, things like.

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:40.149 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So really simply
put, a ketogenic diet

00:47:40.149 --> 00:47:42.818 align:middle line:84%
staves the nutrition source that
the cells, which is glucose.

00:47:42.818 --> 00:47:44.487 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: It does,
yeah-- the growth

00:47:44.487 --> 00:47:46.655 align:middle line:84%
factors, which are
driven by insulin,

00:47:46.655 --> 00:47:48.657 align:middle line:90%
glucose, the primary fuel.

00:47:48.657 --> 00:47:50.326 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
the ketogenic diet

00:47:50.326 --> 00:47:51.410 align:middle line:90%
is a high-protein diet.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.203 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:53.954 align:middle line:84%
It's got like half
the amount of protein.

00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:57.208 align:middle line:84%
So it's in a way
limiting the amino acids.

00:47:57.208 --> 00:48:00.127 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly
from my research

00:48:00.127 --> 00:48:03.422 align:middle line:84%
perspective it elevates
these ketone molecules.

00:48:03.422 --> 00:48:06.967 align:middle line:84%
And these ketones serve
two anti-cancer effects.

00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:09.804 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, they provide
highly efficient fuel

00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:11.972 align:middle line:90%
for your brain in healthy cells.

00:48:11.972 --> 00:48:17.728 align:middle line:84%
But your cancer cells cannot use
them to generate energy if they

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:20.106 align:middle line:84%
have defective mitochondria,
which basically most cancer

00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:21.065 align:middle line:90%
cells do.

00:48:21.065 --> 00:48:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And ketones also
have, I mentioned,

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:25.236 align:middle line:90%
signaling properties.

00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:28.364 align:middle line:84%
So they have
anti-inflammatory effects that

00:48:28.364 --> 00:48:29.990 align:middle line:90%
lead to anti-cancer effects.

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:34.662 align:middle line:84%
They activate genes that
are antioxidant genes that

00:48:34.662 --> 00:48:38.290 align:middle line:84%
will protect normal cells
from further transforming

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:40.334 align:middle line:90%
into cancer cells.

00:48:40.334 --> 00:48:47.216 align:middle line:84%
And for reasons we don't
completely understand,

00:48:47.216 --> 00:48:48.968 align:middle line:90%
they inhibit sugar metabolism.

00:48:48.968 --> 00:48:50.803 align:middle line:84%
So they inhibit
some of the what we

00:48:50.803 --> 00:48:52.805 align:middle line:90%
call the glycolytic pathways.

00:48:52.805 --> 00:48:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And some of the enzymes, like
hexokinase and hexokinase II

00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:00.020 align:middle line:84%
are enzymes that the drug
companies are aggressively

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.772 align:middle line:90%
trying to create drugs for.

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.065 align:middle line:90%
The ketones do that.

00:49:03.065 --> 00:49:06.110 align:middle line:84%
They attenuate, or
reduce the activity,

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:11.157 align:middle line:84%
of the sugar-metabolizing
enzymes that are upregulated

00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:11.949 align:middle line:90%
in cancer cells.

00:49:11.949 --> 00:49:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So they have much higher levels
of certain types of enzymes,

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.121 align:middle line:84%
and the ketones tend to
reduce their activity.

00:49:17.121 --> 00:49:17.955 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:18.747 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:21.834 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have so
much to talk about,

00:49:21.834 --> 00:49:25.045 align:middle line:84%
and we only have
10 minutes or so.

00:49:25.045 --> 00:49:27.256 align:middle line:84%
The late Nicholson
Gonzales-- now,

00:49:27.256 --> 00:49:30.968 align:middle line:84%
he wrote some
articles, certainly

00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:32.595 align:middle line:90%
over the last few years.

00:49:32.595 --> 00:49:36.640 align:middle line:84%
2013, I think, is when a number
of came out about the fact

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.102 align:middle line:84%
that there was no proof that
the ketogenic diet actually

00:49:40.102 --> 00:49:41.020 align:middle line:90%
worked with cancer.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:46.734 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, a lot
of what he was pointing to

00:49:46.734 --> 00:49:49.403 align:middle line:84%
were studies having to
do with the Atkins diet.

00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:51.906 align:middle line:84%
And this became a point of
confusion for a lot of people,

00:49:51.906 --> 00:49:52.698 align:middle line:90%
thinking--

00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:53.616 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah,
big difference.

00:49:53.616 --> 00:49:55.534 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gonzales
saying the ketogenic diet

00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:58.954 align:middle line:84%
doesn't work because
they studied the Atkins

00:49:58.954 --> 00:50:02.166 align:middle line:84%
diet and those who followed
that and cancer patients who

00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:03.500 align:middle line:90%
followed the Atkins diet.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.795 align:middle line:84%
Just briefly explain--
ketogenic and Atkins

00:50:06.795 --> 00:50:08.297 align:middle line:90%
are not the same thing.

00:50:08.297 --> 00:50:10.758 align:middle line:84%
Explain what he was
looking at there.

00:50:10.758 --> 00:50:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And why were there no
studies, long-term studies,

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:16.972 align:middle line:84%
available on the ketogenic
effects on cancer

00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:19.475 align:middle line:84%
that Gonzales could have
gone from three years ago.

00:50:19.475 --> 00:50:20.851 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO:
Yeah, well, there's

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:23.437 align:middle line:84%
an enormous amount of
preclinical animal models.

00:50:23.437 --> 00:50:26.106 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there are
clinical trials, pilot trials,

00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:27.149 align:middle line:90%
that have been published.

00:50:27.149 --> 00:50:30.236 align:middle line:84%
One just came out this
week, or last week.

00:50:30.236 --> 00:50:31.654 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
animal-- some people

00:50:31.654 --> 00:50:33.113 align:middle line:84%
say, no, it has to
be human, right?

00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:36.408 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah
yeah, absolutely.

00:50:36.408 --> 00:50:37.785 align:middle line:84%
There are animal
studies actually

00:50:37.785 --> 00:50:39.578 align:middle line:90%
that use human cancer cells.

00:50:39.578 --> 00:50:41.872 align:middle line:84%
They're called
patient-derived xenografts.

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:43.874 align:middle line:90%
And there's good data with that.

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:47.586 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
some good models out now.

00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:49.046 align:middle line:84%
We're a little
biased, but we think

00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:52.049 align:middle line:84%
that our model is a
metastatic cancer model,

00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:55.219 align:middle line:84%
and we think it's very important
to study the metastasis

00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:57.137 align:middle line:84%
because people generally
don't die of a tumor.

00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:59.723 align:middle line:84%
They die of the
metastatic process.

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:00.808 align:middle line:90%
So that's a whole other--

00:51:00.808 --> 00:51:01.892 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, which we--

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:03.769 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: I'll get to this.

00:51:03.769 --> 00:51:05.729 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is one of
the studies published

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:07.815 align:middle line:84%
by Eugene Fine,
and it was funded

00:51:07.815 --> 00:51:09.858 align:middle line:90%
by the Atkins Association.

00:51:09.858 --> 00:51:13.696 align:middle line:84%
And it used a modified Atkins,
but more of a ketogenic diet,

00:51:13.696 --> 00:51:17.241 align:middle line:90%
and showed remarkable effect.

00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:23.038 align:middle line:84%
The title of the study is called
Insulin Suppression Contributes

00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:23.831 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:29.545 align:middle line:84%
or-- they don't use the words
"ketogetic diet" in the study,

00:51:29.545 --> 00:51:31.422 align:middle line:84%
but that's what they
used, a ketogenic drink.

00:51:31.422 --> 00:51:33.757 align:middle line:84%
Because it was kind
of controversial.

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:39.263 align:middle line:84%
So just in short, the Atkins
diet is comprised of like 30%

00:51:39.263 --> 00:51:40.806 align:middle line:90%
to up to 40%--

00:51:40.806 --> 00:51:42.516 align:middle line:90%
I've seen 50% protein.

00:51:42.516 --> 00:51:43.559 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Animal protein.

00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Animal protein.

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:49.064 align:middle line:84%
Whereas clinically, the
classical ketogenic diet

00:51:49.064 --> 00:51:51.775 align:middle line:84%
is somewhere like
8% to 12% protein.

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.360 align:middle line:90%
It's very low in protein.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's really the diet--

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.239 align:middle line:84%
if you have severe,
advanced cancer, that's

00:51:57.239 --> 00:51:59.575 align:middle line:84%
what you want to start your
cancer patients out on,

00:51:59.575 --> 00:52:01.660 align:middle line:84%
something like a
classical ketogenic diet

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.162 align:middle line:90%
that's low in protein.

00:52:03.162 --> 00:52:07.041 align:middle line:84%
And you would further
enhance the ketosis

00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:10.336 align:middle line:84%
or the anti-cancer effects by
calorie-restricting that diet.

00:52:10.336 --> 00:52:12.296 align:middle line:84%
So then you would
have profound decrease

00:52:12.296 --> 00:52:15.674 align:middle line:84%
in insulin and glucagon
and elevation and ketones.

00:52:15.674 --> 00:52:17.301 align:middle line:84%
And then you
transition them to what

00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:21.388 align:middle line:84%
we call a modified ketogenic
diet, which would be about half

00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:27.227 align:middle line:84%
of the protein of an Atkins
diet, about maybe 20% max,

00:52:27.227 --> 00:52:29.063 align:middle line:84%
but enough to ensure
that the patient is not

00:52:29.063 --> 00:52:30.856 align:middle line:90%
protein-deficient.

00:52:30.856 --> 00:52:32.524 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
ramp up the calories

00:52:32.524 --> 00:52:35.486 align:middle line:90%
once the tumor is controlled.

00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:38.739 align:middle line:84%
We do think that the
ketogenic diet would work--

00:52:38.739 --> 00:52:41.325 align:middle line:84%
we're developing a trial
to use a ketogenic diet

00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:42.743 align:middle line:90%
as an adjuvant.

00:52:42.743 --> 00:52:46.205 align:middle line:84%
So when the standard of
care doesn't work, radiation

00:52:46.205 --> 00:52:51.293 align:middle line:84%
or chemotherapy, the
ketogenic diet sensitizes--

00:52:51.293 --> 00:52:54.380 align:middle line:84%
makes the tumor much more
vulnerable to other modalities

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.589 align:middle line:90%
you put on top of it.

00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:59.009 align:middle line:84%
And if you go on
clinicaltrials.gov--

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:02.846 align:middle line:84%
and I respect the
late Dr. Gonzales,

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:05.557 align:middle line:84%
but if you go to
clinicaltrials.gov,

00:53:05.557 --> 00:53:07.017 align:middle line:90%
you'll see about a dozen trials.

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:08.894 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
were out during the time

00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:11.980 align:middle line:84%
he wrote the article, but
but these trials are now

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:16.110 align:middle line:84%
in process, and some of
them have come to an end

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:18.904 align:middle line:84%
and show that the
ketogenic diet is safe

00:53:18.904 --> 00:53:21.865 align:middle line:84%
and that patients have
a much better outcome

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:24.243 align:middle line:84%
if they follow the ketogenic
diet, especially when they

00:53:24.243 --> 00:53:25.786 align:middle line:84%
combine it with the
standard of care.

00:53:25.786 --> 00:53:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
think the article

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.664 align:middle line:84%
I read was from about
three years ago.

00:53:28.664 --> 00:53:31.125 align:middle line:84%
So it may be a
little behind by now.

00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:32.501 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And
there are a lot

00:53:32.501 --> 00:53:35.546 align:middle line:84%
of reasons why it's hard
to do these diet studies.

00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:38.298 align:middle line:84%
You have to fund it, and
you've got to get IRB approval.

00:53:38.298 --> 00:53:39.425 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
oncologists on board.

00:53:39.425 --> 00:53:40.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It takes time.

00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:44.012 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, and
compliance with the diet.

00:53:44.012 --> 00:53:47.266 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we only
have five minutes left here.

00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:50.519 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get into the ketone
supplement phase of this.

00:53:50.519 --> 00:53:53.981 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people who
are vegans, for example,

00:53:53.981 --> 00:53:56.483 align:middle line:84%
even vegetarians, it's like, I
do not want to eat the animal

00:53:56.483 --> 00:53:58.152 align:middle line:84%
protein, I don't want
grass-fed butter,

00:53:58.152 --> 00:53:59.445 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do that--

00:53:59.445 --> 00:54:00.320 align:middle line:90%
no eggs.

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.406 align:middle line:84%
And so let's look
at the spectrum.

00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:03.866 align:middle line:84%
We already know
in general how it

00:54:03.866 --> 00:54:07.494 align:middle line:84%
works in terms of mostly fat,
small amounts of protein,

00:54:07.494 --> 00:54:11.081 align:middle line:84%
low carbohydrate, lots of
vegetables in particular.

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:13.459 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go to the next
level, say vegetarians.

00:54:13.459 --> 00:54:15.127 align:middle line:90%
How would they contend with it?

00:54:15.127 --> 00:54:16.587 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Vegetarian--
non-vegan but vegetarians?

00:54:16.587 --> 00:54:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Non-vegan.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:21.925 align:middle line:84%
Much easier because you have
the luxury of using dairy.

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And the original ketogenic diet
is really a dairy-based diet.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:27.264 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Grass-fed
butter and organic cream.

00:54:27.264 --> 00:54:28.307 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:28.307 --> 00:54:29.600 align:middle line:90%
I would definitely go for that.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.684 align:middle line:90%
Sour cream is great.

00:54:30.684 --> 00:54:32.895 align:middle line:84%
I make a chocolate keto
mousse out of sour cream

00:54:32.895 --> 00:54:34.563 align:middle line:90%
that's fantastic.

00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:39.443 align:middle line:84%
But eggs, too-- so egg yolk is
like a perfect ketogenic food.

00:54:39.443 --> 00:54:41.778 align:middle line:84%
So for years, I threw
away all my egg yolks.

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:43.822 align:middle line:84%
And now I feel guilty
because I was throwing away

00:54:43.822 --> 00:54:44.948 align:middle line:90%
all the nutrition.

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.867 align:middle line:84%
And now if you go to
a fancy restaurant,

00:54:46.867 --> 00:54:49.077 align:middle line:84%
you can even have an
egg-white omelet made for you.

00:54:49.077 --> 00:54:51.038 align:middle line:84%
They throw the egg yolks
away, which is tragic.

00:54:51.038 --> 00:54:51.872 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no!

00:54:51.872 --> 00:54:52.664 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:54:52.664 --> 00:54:53.749 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: But,
yeah, an egg yolk

00:54:53.749 --> 00:54:55.250 align:middle line:84%
is like a perfect
ketogenic-- so you

00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:59.087 align:middle line:84%
have eggs and dairy,
macadamia nuts, or all nuts,

00:54:59.087 --> 00:55:01.757 align:middle line:90%
really-- avocado, all the oils.

00:55:01.757 --> 00:55:04.551 align:middle line:84%
Coconut oil is
especially helpful

00:55:04.551 --> 00:55:06.386 align:middle line:90%
because it's very ketogenic.

00:55:06.386 --> 00:55:09.848 align:middle line:84%
It contains what we call
medium-chain triglyceride oils.

00:55:09.848 --> 00:55:13.185 align:middle line:84%
And these oils, instead of
being packaged into chylomicrons

00:55:13.185 --> 00:55:15.312 align:middle line:84%
and going into
lymphatics, they're

00:55:15.312 --> 00:55:17.189 align:middle line:84%
transported directly
to your liver

00:55:17.189 --> 00:55:19.107 align:middle line:84%
through hepatic
portal circulation,

00:55:19.107 --> 00:55:21.318 align:middle line:84%
and they make ketones
very, very rapidly.

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:23.028 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, coconut oil.

00:55:23.028 --> 00:55:25.113 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: So
a vegetarian diet

00:55:25.113 --> 00:55:29.451 align:middle line:84%
would be liberal
use of dairy, and I

00:55:29.451 --> 00:55:31.245 align:middle line:90%
think organic is the way to go.

00:55:31.245 --> 00:55:32.371 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But not milk
and cheese necessarily.

00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:34.373 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: No, not
dairy protein, dairy fat.

00:55:34.373 --> 00:55:35.123 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're talking
high fat, only high fat.

00:55:35.123 --> 00:55:36.416 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, I should
make that distinction.

00:55:36.416 --> 00:55:37.834 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people don't
get that distinction.

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:38.293 align:middle line:90%
It's a big deal.

00:55:38.293 --> 00:55:39.836 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah,
that's important.

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:42.005 align:middle line:84%
Because I actually have
a dairy protein allergy.

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:44.675 align:middle line:84%
So cottage cheese and
milk I don't tolerate,

00:55:44.675 --> 00:55:47.469 align:middle line:84%
but I can eat sour
cream and be fine.

00:55:47.469 --> 00:55:48.262 align:middle line:90%
I can eat--

00:55:48.262 --> 00:55:49.221 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, cream, butter.

00:55:49.221 --> 00:55:50.347 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Butter, ghee.

00:55:50.347 --> 00:55:52.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Skimming the cream
off the top of the dairy

00:55:52.599 --> 00:55:53.767 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yes, yes.

00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And I do source out like
eggs from free-range chickens

00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:58.855 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:03.443 align:middle line:84%
And the yolk is much
more rich and nutritious.

00:56:03.443 --> 00:56:05.362 align:middle line:84%
And the other foods that
you would incorporate

00:56:05.362 --> 00:56:08.282 align:middle line:84%
in a vegetarian diet in
addition to eggs and dairy

00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:11.577 align:middle line:84%
would be pretty much all
the green vegetables.

00:56:11.577 --> 00:56:13.704 align:middle line:84%
Avocado, as I mentioned,
are wonderful.

00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:19.376 align:middle line:84%
Olive oil, macadamia
nut oil, avocado oil

00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:22.337 align:middle line:90%
are wonderful sources of fats.

00:56:22.337 --> 00:56:24.798 align:middle line:84%
So you what you
really need to do,

00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:27.259 align:middle line:84%
and it's a little bit easier
when you have meat because you

00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:29.177 align:middle line:84%
can get cuts of meat
that are very fat.

00:56:29.177 --> 00:56:30.887 align:middle line:90%
Chicken has a skin.

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:33.765 align:middle line:84%
Salmon is a very fatty
fish, sardines, mackerel.

00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:35.434 align:middle line:90%
Things like that are fatty fish.

00:56:35.434 --> 00:56:37.894 align:middle line:84%
And I incorporate some of
that into my personal diet.

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:40.564 align:middle line:84%
But a vegetarian
diet is pretty easy.

00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:42.649 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not let's to
vegan and then very quickly

00:56:42.649 --> 00:56:44.318 align:middle line:84%
into the supplementation,
because we're

00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:45.110 align:middle line:90%
almost out of time.

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:47.237 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: OK, so
a vegan ketogenic diet

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:48.655 align:middle line:90%
is very challenging.

00:56:48.655 --> 00:56:51.241 align:middle line:84%
And I get many emails
per week about this.

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:53.327 align:middle line:84%
And I have a friend
who's vegetarian

00:56:53.327 --> 00:56:55.871 align:middle line:84%
and some who are vegan that
really want to do this,

00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm working with them
on developing a book, which

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:02.669 align:middle line:84%
will cover the basics
about how to implement

00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:04.463 align:middle line:90%
a vegan ketogenic diet.

00:57:04.463 --> 00:57:06.715 align:middle line:84%
And all the foods
that I mentioned

00:57:06.715 --> 00:57:12.429 align:middle line:84%
would be OK, excluding, of
course, the dairy and the eggs.

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:18.852 align:middle line:84%
But as far as protein, there are
a number of plant-based protein

00:57:18.852 --> 00:57:21.813 align:middle line:84%
extracts that are available--
protein powders that are made.

00:57:21.813 --> 00:57:23.899 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you think
are the most superior?

00:57:23.899 --> 00:57:25.400 align:middle line:90%
There's pea powder.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.902 align:middle line:90%
There's every kind of--

00:57:26.902 --> 00:57:28.487 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

00:57:28.487 --> 00:57:35.786 align:middle line:84%
Organic rice protein isolates
are pretty good, hemp protein.

00:57:35.786 --> 00:57:38.955 align:middle line:84%
The thing with hemp protein,
it doesn't taste all that well.

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:40.707 align:middle line:84%
But there was a couple
products out that

00:57:40.707 --> 00:57:41.792 align:middle line:90%
are getting a little bit.

00:57:41.792 --> 00:57:42.626 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A couple are OK.

00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Pea
is a little OK.

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.672 align:middle line:84%
I like that a little bit
farther down on the list.

00:57:46.672 --> 00:57:50.092 align:middle line:84%
I tried some potato
protein, and surprisingly it

00:57:50.092 --> 00:57:51.802 align:middle line:84%
was like very low
in carbohydrates,

00:57:51.802 --> 00:57:54.805 align:middle line:84%
like two grams of carbs
per like 30-gram serving.

00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:58.934 align:middle line:84%
And so you want to make sure how
these proteins are made, too.

00:57:58.934 --> 00:58:02.562 align:middle line:84%
You don't want proteins that are
made through different chemical

00:58:02.562 --> 00:58:04.106 align:middle line:90%
extractions and whatnot.

00:58:04.106 --> 00:58:06.608 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to do
some research on that.

00:58:06.608 --> 00:58:07.567 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Natural,
organic, and so forth.

00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yes.

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.862 align:middle line:84%
But your protein
needs can be met

00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:13.448 align:middle line:90%
with various plants and nuts.

00:58:13.448 --> 00:58:15.367 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, macadamia
nut is like perfect.

00:58:15.367 --> 00:58:17.244 align:middle line:84%
And you can make nut
butters and things like,

00:58:17.244 --> 00:58:19.287 align:middle line:90%
which are delicious.

00:58:19.287 --> 00:58:21.623 align:middle line:84%
And you could further
boost your protein

00:58:21.623 --> 00:58:23.458 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit
these protein powders.

00:58:23.458 --> 00:58:27.421 align:middle line:84%
And I have a Dutch chocolate
I think hemp and brown rice

00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:29.506 align:middle line:90%
protein powder that I've used.

00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:33.552 align:middle line:84%
And I put it into my
chocolate mousse at night.

00:58:33.552 --> 00:58:39.933 align:middle line:84%
And so I like broccoli
and various vegetables,

00:58:39.933 --> 00:58:42.561 align:middle line:84%
too, that tend to be a
little bit higher in protein.

00:58:42.561 --> 00:58:44.938 align:middle line:84%
I make cauliflower
mashed potatoes.

00:58:44.938 --> 00:58:46.857 align:middle line:84%
So you just overcook
cauliflower a little bit.

00:58:46.857 --> 00:58:47.357 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:48.150 align:middle line:90%
It's delicious.

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:51.069 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And throw
in, instead of butter,

00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:52.696 align:middle line:84%
there's other things
that you can use--

00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:53.029 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Coconut oil.

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: You can use
coconut cream, coconut oil,

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.366 align:middle line:90%
and salt and pepper.

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.367 align:middle line:90%
And then you have your--

00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:58.076 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you can do it.

00:58:58.076 --> 00:58:59.870 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be a
little more diligent.

00:58:59.870 --> 00:59:03.039 align:middle line:84%
But now we get to the final
part before we wrap it up,

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:04.916 align:middle line:84%
and that is there are
ketone supplements.

00:59:04.916 --> 00:59:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about how
efficacious they are

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.839 align:middle line:90%
and available they are.

00:59:10.839 --> 00:59:12.591 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: OK.

00:59:12.591 --> 00:59:15.427 align:middle line:84%
The ones that are
most potent right now

00:59:15.427 --> 00:59:16.553 align:middle line:90%
are the ketone esters.

00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:21.099 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing the
FDA studies to get them

00:59:21.099 --> 00:59:24.644 align:middle line:84%
a status called Generally
Recognized As Safe, or GRAS.

00:59:24.644 --> 00:59:26.271 align:middle line:84%
So they're under
investigation now.

00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:31.234 align:middle line:84%
The ones on the market now
would be the ketone mineral salt

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:36.323 align:middle line:84%
supplements in combination with
medium-chain triglyceride fats.

00:59:36.323 --> 00:59:40.118 align:middle line:84%
And the combination of a ketone
and a mineral salt, which

00:59:40.118 --> 00:59:44.039 align:middle line:84%
is essentially a ketone with
sodium, potassium, magnesium

00:59:44.039 --> 00:59:46.500 align:middle line:84%
combined with it-- so
it's delivering minerals

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:48.710 align:middle line:84%
to your body in
addition to ketones.

00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:52.255 align:middle line:84%
And we combine it with
medium-chain triglyceride

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:53.215 align:middle line:90%
powder.

00:59:53.215 --> 00:59:57.052 align:middle line:84%
And the fat enhances our
own ketone production

00:59:57.052 --> 01:00:00.180 align:middle line:84%
by beta oxidation
of liver and also

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.724 align:middle line:84%
functions as sort of a
carrier for the ketones.

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:06.978 align:middle line:84%
So it in a way kind of
delays absorption and helps

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:10.982 align:middle line:84%
increase the sustained
effect of ketones over time,

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.108 align:middle line:90%
adding a little bit of fat.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.236 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would this be
beneficial, particularly

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:15.695 align:middle line:90%
for vegetarians or vegans?

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:16.488 align:middle line:90%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:19.491 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In general, just for
your overall health profile.

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:23.161 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, I think it's
like medium-chain triglyceride

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:25.956 align:middle line:90%
oil but much more effective.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:33.672 align:middle line:84%
It's a supplement that can
enhance nutritional ketosis.

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So you could be on a diet that's
much more liberal with protein

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.845 align:middle line:84%
and even carbohydrates,
and you check your blood,

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:42.889 align:middle line:84%
and you can be in a state
of ketosis that mimics

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:44.641 align:middle line:90%
the classical ketogenic diet.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.853 align:middle line:84%
So you get all the
therapeutic benefits

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:50.897 align:middle line:84%
with circumventing some of
the dietary restriction,

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:52.566 align:middle line:84%
classically associated
with achieving

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:53.525 align:middle line:90%
that therapeutic state.

01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:56.111 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, in the Western
world, we like silver bullets.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And even though it's
not a silver bullet,

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.574 align:middle line:84%
it's still nonetheless
something close to it.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like it's very hopeful
for all of our chronic health

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.163 align:middle line:90%
conditions, cancer included.

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:09.124 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing a lot
of work in this field.

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Any product lines we can
just go online and get?

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.713 align:middle line:84%
Or does it all have to
go through physicians?

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.756 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Well, some
of it through physicians.

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:19.801 align:middle line:10%
The companies that
are incorporating

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.511 align:middle line:10%
sort of the technology
that we develop

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:24.973 align:middle line:10%
would be Pruvit and Kegenix.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:26.099 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Pruvit, OK.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:28.518 align:middle line:10%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Pruvit
spelled P-R-U-V-I-T.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:31.271 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: P-R-U-V-I-T. OK.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:32.647 align:middle line:10%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And
another company

01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:35.525 align:middle line:10%
which may have a little more
potent product out there

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.401 align:middle line:10%
is called Kegenix.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:37.193 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kegenix.

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:40.196 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Yeah, and they are
a Tampa-based company near me.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:43.199 align:middle line:90%
And Forever Green also--

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:46.578 align:middle line:84%
they make a line of supplements,
and one is called Ketopia.

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:49.372 align:middle line:84%
So that would be three
companies right now

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:52.709 align:middle line:84%
that incorporate this
technology into their products.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:53.501 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fabulous.

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.795 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: And like I
said, you can take the product

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and achieve nutritional
ketosis and get

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.092 align:middle line:90%
the therapeutic benefits of it.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:01.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:04.137 align:middle line:84%
What a crash course we've
just had in an hour.

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:06.514 align:middle line:84%
I thank you so much for the
incredible work you're doing

01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:08.642 align:middle line:84%
and also for helping us
gain some clarity on this.

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:12.103 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a very confusing
topic, especially if someone

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.189 align:middle line:84%
is given a diagnosis
and are frightened

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:16.608 align:middle line:84%
into doing
conventional therapies.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:18.652 align:middle line:84%
This is really good to
know about beforehand.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:19.444 align:middle line:84%
>>D'AGOSTINO: Thank
you for having me.

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:19.819 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.321 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
thank you, Dominic.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.281 align:middle line:84%
You can find out much
more about Dominic's work

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:26.368 align:middle line:84%
by going to ketonutrition.org,
all one word.

01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:28.745 align:middle line:10%
We also spoke with
Dr. Donese Williams,

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:31.623 align:middle line:10%
who speaks as an MD and
naturopathic physician

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:34.459 align:middle line:10%
about the use of ketones
with her cancer patients

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:36.002 align:middle line:10%
and other clients as well.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:37.462 align:middle line:10%
Keep an eye out
for that on Gaia.

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.422 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.007 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."
