>>SIMON CHOKOISKY: We entered
a massive outsider period

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.340 align:middle line:90%
that isn't over until 2033.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have 12
years left in this.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.290 align:middle line:84%
People are questioning
mainstream media.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:84%
People are questioning
mainstream government.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.910 align:middle line:84%
People are questioning
mainstream economics.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the questioning
is part of it.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:90%
The anxiety is part of it.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Open up to the
divine and say, Lord,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:90%
how was this part of the plan?

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling so
abandoned right now.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Please help me.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:90%
That's actually healthy.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.910 align:middle line:90%
And then let the answers come.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:84%
We are all functionally
outsiders right now.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:90%
And how we handle this--

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:84%
the great thing about
an outsider, period,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:90%
is you have tremendous freedom.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Embrace the positive and take
responsibility and say, OK.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:90%
The viveka.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:90%
In Sanskrit, the word is viveka.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Nitya anitya vastu viveka.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:84%
To know the difference between
what is ultimately real

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.775 align:middle line:90%
and what is not real.

00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:01.942 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: And that
is the biggest challenge

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:90%

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.800 align:middle line:84%
One of our Gaia favorites,
Simon Chokoisky,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
is back with us
today and we're going

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.180 align:middle line:84%
to be riffing on a few
current and relevant themes.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.910 align:middle line:10%
With a renewed global
interest in the alien issue

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:10%
these days, Simon
and I will discuss,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:10%
among other topics,
aliens and spirituality

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:10%
from a Vedic perspective.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of you watching
this believe

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
that a more advanced
species is going

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to save humanity, while
others believe it's up to us.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to dive
into that a little bit.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.395 align:middle line:84%
But we're going
off-script right away.

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:34.685 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Let's do it.

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:36.518 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We weren't
planning on doing this,

00:01:36.518 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:84%
but it's just so
fascinating, we need to.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
With the whole global COVID
thing that has passed through

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
now, by now it's-- gosh,
it's coming up on two years.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And we've watched
waves go through.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
We've watched society
divide itself, the shaming--

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
each side shaming
the other side.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.893 align:middle line:90%
Division, division, division.

00:01:55.893 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Simon, I want to talk
to you about this,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
because you've been talking to
your private audience about it.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:10%
Well, my way into everything is
through the astrological angle.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:10%
And what astrology
gives us is an insight

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:10%
into, how am I going
to handle this?

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the way I
approach things.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And based on my
experience with my chart,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the
chart of clients,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.160 align:middle line:84%
there are markers in your
horoscope that show sensitivity

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:84%
especially to
allopathic medicine.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.940 align:middle line:10%
And when those same
markers are absent,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:10%
it means that you would do
well with allopathic medicine.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:10%
Because some people
love antibiotics.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:10%
They love their
allopathic drugs.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:90%
They work for them.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And others, if they get on
even the most minor kind

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.090 align:middle line:84%
of-- metformin or whatever it
is, they have severe reactions.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
It's an individual
case and I think

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
having kind of a
tempered view of it,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that it's not absolute--
it's case-dependent.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Vedic tradition is
always, is aspirin good or bad

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:90%
for you?

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, it depends.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.547 align:middle line:84%
Who is the person
we're talking about?

00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
find it fascinating.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.547 align:middle line:84%
If someone were to, say,
pull up their chart-- or, say

00:03:09.547 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
you have someone who knows
what a chart looks like

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:90%
and what these things mean.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Have their chart
read, where would you

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
be able-- what house,
what signs, would you see

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.198 align:middle line:90%
sensitivities in, in general?

00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, they'll have to do their
own homework on this one.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
There are parts of the zodiac
in the horoscope-- in the Vedic

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:84%
zodiac especially--
called Sarpa drekkanas.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.770 align:middle line:90%
And a drekkana is a decanate.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a 10-degree portion of
the zodiac that's associated

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:90%
with poison-- with snakes.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:90%
"Sarpa" means snake.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
It's where the word "serpent"
comes from, in Sanskrit.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
The serpent parts of the
horoscope, which are maybe,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, a fourth
of the chart or so,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.670 align:middle line:84%
if you have planets there, then
they'll indicate sensitivity,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's a mollific
planet, like Mars, or Saturn,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:90%
It can be--

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What if it's Venus?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: If it's Venus,
then it means that you will be

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:84%
especially sensitive
to a love situation,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.103 align:middle line:84%
potentially venereal
diseases, potentially--

00:04:11.103 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Things that
come through love.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Through
love, yes, exactly.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: STDs.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: STDs,
stuff like that.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So you would be poisoned
through those things.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But if it's Mars,
Saturn, the south node

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
or the north node
of the moon, it

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.735 align:middle line:84%
can be potentially
more dangerous.

00:04:25.735 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's fascinating.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
particularly if you're

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:84%
in a period of life that's
ruled by those planets,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
then you have to be
especially careful.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:90%
And granted, it's not--

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:84%
most of the population doesn't
have any kind of-- doesn't have

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:90%
that severe of a--

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking a sample from
the charts that I've read.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.727 align:middle line:84%
Most of the clients
that I've read

00:04:47.727 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
don't have severe issues
there, but a few do.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And those are the people
that I would caution.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And they, I think, intuitively
also know that, hey, this is--

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.565 align:middle line:84%
I've got to do a
lot of research.

00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I feel like I-- yeah,
I can't do this without really

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
knowing what I'm doing,
because other drugs have

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:90%
affected them poorly.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
get a Vedic chart,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.272 align:middle line:90%
because those look different.

00:05:08.272 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
How would that look
in Western astrology?

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: In
Western astrology,

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
which also uses the decanates
and the divisions of the sign,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I would look at the
nodes of the moon.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I would look at aspects between
the nodes in your ascendant--

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
some of the outer
planets, like Sedna.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Sedna has to do with drowning.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And part of the COVID
symptoms are, you're drowning.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.742 align:middle line:84%
If you were to get it,
the lungs are affected--

00:05:31.742 --> 00:05:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Feeling like
you can't breathe.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's targeted
at the lungs.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: If Sedna is in--

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:84%
so there are ways to look at in
the Western horoscope as well.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But most of all, listen
and trust your body.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
If you've had reactions to
allopathic and chemical things

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:84%
in the past, if you
have a delicate--

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:90%
this is an individual choice.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I respect people's right
to their own choice.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't necessarily respect--

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.002 align:middle line:84%
I respect people's
right to their opinion.

00:05:56.002 --> 00:05:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
respect the opinion itself.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, I
respect your right

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:84%
to have it on
whatever side you are.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.783 align:middle line:90%
And this is my opinion.

00:06:03.783 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
so deeply personal,

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.160 align:middle line:84%
because we have been
under-educated and

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:90%
under-informed about it.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:84%
We have not been
educated at all.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I found
really interesting is--

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I went through the whole
COVID experience personally.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
What I found interesting
at the end of it

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:84%
all is how little
information we'd

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:90%
been given about any of it.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.515 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we-- my husband and
I could have easily infected

00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
other people because we
didn't even know we had it.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Because there are certain subtle
symptoms you would think, oh,

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:90%
maybe I have a little allergy.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people thought
they had allergies.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Without education, we're really
all left to our own devices.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And that makes us
jumpy and nervous.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And no one knows who's
right or wrong yet on this.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that's
the responsible thing.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
You bring up the word education,
and a tempered and sort

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.750 align:middle line:84%
of even-minded
approach to, hey, here

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
is what we know, and make
your decisions based on that.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, let's look--

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
we do this-- you and I do
other interviews on my site

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
too, where we go into these
astrological cycles about what

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:90%
to look for.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's do that now regarding the
whole COVID era that's inside

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:90%
of an outsider dharma era.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And you had said that
April of 2021, things

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:90%
will start loosening up.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Life will start--
well, that did happen.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Life started returning
to normal, so to speak.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's going
to go back a little bit.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.242 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I want to talk about.

00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:34.470 align:middle line:84%
What's the next cycle in the
fall, and then into 2022?

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:84%
In the Vedic chart, we're
following the movement

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.550 align:middle line:90%
of the planet Jupiter.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to sound
crazy to someone who is not

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:90%
really trained in astrology.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter?

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:84%
What does Jupiter have
to do with COVID or this?

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:55.405 align:middle line:84%
But just follow along, maybe
with an open mind, hopefully.

00:07:55.405 --> 00:07:56.205 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:90%
The show is called "Open Minds."

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Exactly.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So yeah, requirement.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: As Jupiter was in
the sidereal sign of Capricorn,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:84%
all of this stuff
happened with COVID.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Then it changed into Aquarius,
which has given us relief.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.025 align:middle line:90%
It's about to go back.

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's
going retrograde?

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah, in fall.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For how long?

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.118 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's going to
be there for a few months.

00:08:17.118 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Starting, I think,
September or so of 2021,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:90%
we'll be back in that position.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
These lockdown-- Capricorn
is a sign of confinement,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:84%
whereas Aquarius is all
about, I want to be free.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Boy, have we seen
that quite literally reflected

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.830 align:middle line:90%
in society around the world.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: So we're going
to go back a little bit.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be--

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.730 align:middle line:84%
probably will be
some more lockdowns

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:84%
on a more limited basis, because
we won't be there too long.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
But at least two
or three months.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so by 2022?

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Should
start to get relief.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But really not until the
spring of 2022, I think.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
This thing-- the residue,
and the residual effect,

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:84%
is going to stay with
us for a long time--

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.940 align:middle line:90%
fortunately and unfortunately.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:90%
In some ways--

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.918 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
what you mean by that.

00:09:05.918 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Well, as we were
saying a little bit off camera,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:90%
viruses, in many ways--

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.270 align:middle line:84%
from the biological
perspective--

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.920 align:middle line:90%
drive our evolution forward.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We've co-existed with
viruses for a very long time.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Like I mentioned about
the markets falling.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.130 align:middle line:84%
You either become--
you either freak out

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.840 align:middle line:90%
or you become very spiritual.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with this.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:84%
You either freak out and have
a negative reaction to it,

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
or you use it to make
your faith stronger,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to bring you deeper
into self-knowledge

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and to try to be
even-minded, even

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
within-- while the
hurricane is going--

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to try to be the eye
of the hurricane,

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
even while everything is
spinning and breaking down

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:90%
around you, apparently.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I mean, just
on a personal level,

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I shared with you off-camera,
I had this inexplicable,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.055 align:middle line:84%
kind of euphoric experience
when I was done-- everything--

00:09:59.055 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I was breathing fine,
out of the woods,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and recovered, basically.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I felt like something
good had just happened,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.125 align:middle line:90%
like there was an--

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:10.250 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even explain it.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:90%
Because it was just a feeling--

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:90%
an upgrade of sorts.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:90%
And then I was flashing.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And you and I were
talking about viruses.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And my husband Zeus,
many times, has

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
said viruses have
always brought him

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level of some
part of his consciousness.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And we're not looking
at it in this way.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, society is not
looking at it in this way.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this is an
invitation for people

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:84%
to start looking at what
these potentials are,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:84%
our evolutionary path--
because we're in a big one.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that in the outsider--

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about
the outsider phase.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.310 align:middle line:84%
We're in a big potential
for evolutionary leap.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So having this
thing on the planet

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.470 align:middle line:84%
gave us an opportunity
to, as you say,

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
see ourselves, and
contend, and grow.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Even physiologically, viruses
have helped us evolve.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Many biological functions
are a product of viruses.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
The human placenta
is a product of that,

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and other biological
things we take for granted.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:90%
They're with us.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:84%
We just need to look
at a higher level.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.745 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And the question
with this one that a lot

00:11:16.745 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:84%
of people said--
well, they're with us,

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
man-made, or-- and--

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, that's true.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.715 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: That's a
valid point to look at.

00:11:24.715 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's problematic.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't behave like
an influenza or a cold.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You get totally
different, weird symptoms.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:90%
So it is different.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean the body
can't adapt somehow and jump

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:84%
beyond that, or incorporate
it, on some level,

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%
on an immune system.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we go into a
lot of fear and such--

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:84%
which, I think an outsider
period does cause fear.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's the easy--
it's the easiest reaction.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural
reaction, actually.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about it.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:90%
We're in this outsider phase.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Give the years
again for those who

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:84%
don't remember this, and how
this whole COVID thing fit in

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
in our natural reaction, and our
opportunity to grow and learn.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, 2016-- end of 2015, but
basically 2016, we began--

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.050 align:middle line:84%
we, the United States as a
country, but really the world,

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Because the US tends to
lead, and kind of the world--

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Watches.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --adopts a
lot of what happens here.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:84%
We entered a massive
outsider period

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:90%
that isn't over until 2033.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:90%
We have 12 years left in this.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, you begin to
question the powers that be.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.298 align:middle line:84%
People are questioning
mainstream media.

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:84%
People who are questioning
mainstream government.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
People are questioning
mainstream economics--

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and creating viable
alternatives.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But in the process
of questioning,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:90%
there's anxiety, fear.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:84%
You start to throw away, OK,
well, the government's not

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.270 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, is all of the
government not working?

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean the trash people
are still coming, right?

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:84%
So you can't throw
all of it away.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:90%
But you have to question.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream
media is not well.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the questioning
is part of it.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:90%
The anxiety is part of it.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.660 align:middle line:84%
What I predict-- and this
is a long-term prediction,

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to make it
here for the first time.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Is that, by 2033,
12 years from now,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
we will have come
full circle and start

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:84%
to have more
appreciation for what

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
we call mainstream media-- for
journalists who have studied

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
six years in college and
got their masters, and who

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
read every day, and who are
on the front lines gathering

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.665 align:middle line:84%
That they might be a little
better at this than--

00:13:36.665 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A blogger who
got a bug up their-- yeah.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --somebody in
their mother's basement.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:90%
We're not there yet.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
We're in the phase,
still, of questioning,

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and rejecting mainstream
politics, media, finance,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.198 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:48.198 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to come
back around to this point

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:84%
after we've been fed a
lot of misinformation

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:84%
by people in their basement,
blogging or whatever.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to say, OK, basta.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:90%
That's enough of this.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's get the experts
back on the train.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's a difference between
somebody who is, even as a kid,

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.010 align:middle line:84%
holding a microphone, and
wanting to be a journalist,

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and trying to figure out
what's happening, and traveling

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:84%
to the front lines, and getting
real stories from people

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:84%
versus someone, again, who
is not a real journalist,

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and who's just kind of
making stuff up, even,

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:90%
at the worst case.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I predict, by 2033, we
will have come full circle.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:84%
We'll appreciate our
leaders a little bit more,

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:84%
our mainstream media a little
bit more, and so forth.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.872 align:middle line:84%
But until then, it's going
to be rocky, rough going.

00:14:36.872 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
Simon, the only way

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:84%
that would happen
is if our leaders

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and if our media also
checked themselves and went

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:84%
through their own
personal evolution

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:84%
so that they were
trustworthy again.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: And it's happening.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.847 align:middle line:90%
So that's going to continue.

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
That general, big trend is
going to continue for a while.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.410 align:middle line:90%
The way to--

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I think, the way to
handle it-- because, see,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:84%
in the outsider
period, outsiders

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:90%
have the wound of abandonment.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, my government
has let me down.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:90%
My father let me down.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.850 align:middle line:84%
With a person, it's usually
the same-sex parent-- usually,

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:90%
not always.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.873 align:middle line:90%
If you're an outsider--

00:15:10.873 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:84%
if I'm an outsider,
as a man, it's

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:84%
usually my dad I feel
abandoned me in some way.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a woman, it's my mom
that I feel distant from.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:23.320 align:middle line:84%
The wound of abandonment
is a blessing in disguise.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:84%
There are a few ways
you can deal with it.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:84%
The worst way is to
go, you abandoned me.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.645 align:middle line:84%
I'm blaming you for
all of my problems.

00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
We can indulge in a
little bit of blame.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:90%
It feels good.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:90%
It's like having

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A tiny pity party.

00:15:36.345 --> 00:15:38.637 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's like having
a-- exactly, a little ice

00:15:38.637 --> 00:15:40.883 align:middle line:84%
cream at midnight, and
just watching rom-coms.

00:15:40.883 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Little tiny
violin for a short time.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Then the next morning, you wake
up and you get back into it.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.590 align:middle line:84%
The wound of
abandonment, there are

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:90%
a number of ways to treat it.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:84%
One of them is, when
you're abandoned,

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:90%
you have to stand alone.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And even in your posture,
the way you stand,

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice people who
have this wound lean a lot.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.400 align:middle line:90%
They're not straight.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:90%
The camera guy is now--

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't do that.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.183 align:middle line:84%
They can't see you--
disappearing from the screen.

00:16:09.183 --> 00:16:09.983 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Right.

00:16:09.983 --> 00:16:11.210 align:middle line:90%
But that's an outsider thing.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:84%
It's, OK, I'm not
playing by your rules.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:90%
So be-- learn to actually stand.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Work on your posture.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Work on the core muscles
that keep you straight.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is--
and I'm talking

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting with the
physical-- is, get a massage.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:90%
The skin is the outsider organ.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:84%
It's what separates us
from the outside world.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:84%
It's where "not
me" becomes "me."

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Get a massage.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Moisturize your skin.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Make sure-- and
it's not for vanity.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:84%
It's for health, for staying
grounded as an outsider.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Those are two physical things.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
On the not so
physical part, become

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:90%
someone who is dependable.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Don't abandon your pets.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Don't abandon some
outside-- oh, I've

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.450 align:middle line:84%
got to move to an apartment, so
I've got to give my dog away.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:90%
Fight for it.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:90%
Fight.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Try to stay true to your word.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
If you say something,
be dependable.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:90%
I know it's hard.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, my car is not working.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.355 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:17:14.355 --> 00:17:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Find another way.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Find another way.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And that heals the
wound of abandonment.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of other things.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is
taking responsibility

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:30.273 align:middle line:84%
for everything in your
life, even things that--

00:17:30.273 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:84%
horrible things that may
have happened to you,

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
like abuse, things like
that, poverty that you

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.860 align:middle line:90%
were born into, whatever it is.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:90%
On some level, you asked for it.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Like, on a karmic
level, on a soul level.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying anyone
asked for abuse or anything

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:90%
like that when they came here.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:84%
But on some level, it's
part of the plan for you.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And open up to the
divine and say, Lord,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:90%
how was this part of the plan?

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling so
abandoned right now.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Please help me.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:90%
That's actually healthy.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:90%
And then let the answers come.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is, in effect,
whether you're an outsider

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:90%
or not--

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and I am, and that's your
second trait too, personally.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
This actually
applies to everyone,

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.155 align:middle line:90%
because the entire era is--

00:18:16.155 --> 00:18:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Correct.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --untethering us--

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: We're all having--

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --from our moorings.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:84%
We all have the abandonment
wound right now.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I can't go to work
anymore because of COVID.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:90%
I feel abandoned.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.105 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't have a
job anymore, or I

00:18:29.105 --> 00:18:31.230 align:middle line:84%
don't have a relationship
anymore because of COVID.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Whatever the case is.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:84%
We are all functionally
outsiders right now.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And how we handle this--

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:84%
the great thing
about an outsider,

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
period, is you have
tremendous freedom--

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
freedom of information,
freedom to act.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have more things I can
do today than options I had,

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:84%
say, if I had a
job 9:00 to 5:00.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.550 align:middle line:90%
I can go to the movies.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:90%
I can ride my bike.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:90%
I can exercise.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I can blog.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So embrace the positive,
and take responsibility

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, this is
what I'm going to do.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take the
high road, not the low road.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so by 2022, we
start moving beyond this phase.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
But we're still outsiders,
so there's still

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.770 align:middle line:84%
more stuff to learn, and
react to, respond to.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.320 align:middle line:84%
The great thing about
outsider periods is,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:84%
there's accelerated evolution
in medicine, in computers,

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
the things that
are leading-edge--

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Quantum computing
is now becoming a reality.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: In
the next 12 years,

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:40.800 align:middle line:84%
we will see things that none
of us have even imagined.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.297 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even from
the very simple point

00:19:43.297 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:90%
of view of vaccines.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.713 align:middle line:84%
No one imagined you
can make a vaccine

00:19:45.713 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:90%
in six months or a year.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing that-- for
good or bad, whatever it is.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Things are
accelerating similarly

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:90%
in the other sciences.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I warned about hacking
three or four-- even 2016,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.317 align:middle line:90%
when we first went into--

00:20:00.317 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, increased hacking.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's
going to only increase.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.175 align:middle line:90%
It's only going to increase.

00:20:05.175 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ransoms.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Ugh.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: 2023 to 2026,
it's going to become--

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.327 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be, I mean,
even bigger than it is now.

00:20:13.327 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So even
on a personal level,

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
we have to get used to the
fact we need to kind of protect

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
our online presence and identity
and create strong passwords,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.907 align:middle line:90%
simple things we can do.

00:20:24.907 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
These guys can get
around a lot of it,

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:84%
but on a simple level, the
ones that aren't as bright,

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:90%
we just have to be careful.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Be careful.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And understand the
outsider's element is space.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.473 align:middle line:84%
And what will happen
is, everyone's

00:20:35.473 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
going to start getting--
the virus wants

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.125 align:middle line:90%
to get into your space.

00:20:38.125 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:10%
Other people want to get into
your space and yell at you,

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:10%
or whatever--

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:10%
is to create a sacred
space for yourself.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:10%
De-clutter your house.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.555 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.555 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:84%
People who have the wound
of abandonment, outsiders,

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:90%
we all do like to get cozy.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
We collect things-- more
pillows, more books, more this,

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:84%
because it feels good
in the short term.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Long-term, those things
constrict our space.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:84%
De-clutter the house,
but create a sacred space

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:84%
through meditation,
through sacred sound.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And do that, also, with
your cyber identity.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:84%
We're in a period now where
it's not yet at its height.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:84%
After 2023, I think
we're going to see

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:84%
a massive upflow of digital
invasiveness, people invading

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.817 align:middle line:90%
your digital space.

00:21:30.817 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
good thing to know,

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:90%
because we're so dependent now.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Our commercial lives are so
dependent on being online.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So it might be we
have to go retro--

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.120 align:middle line:84%
do local business,
carry a little cash.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Be a little more
analog now that--

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's really important,

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:84%
useful information
for people to have.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard
that anywhere else.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.632 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you for that.

00:21:50.632 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going in directions
we weren't planning--

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of tossed
the script out.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.180 align:middle line:84%
But there is one thing on
this nice little suggestion

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:84%
for a conversation that
I did want to get to.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
you want to wrap up

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:84%
about this upcoming period,
our space, preserving our own--

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.765 align:middle line:84%
protecting our identity
and our sovereignty?

00:22:10.765 --> 00:22:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Again,
the important thing

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a lot of freedom
and a lot of options that come.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the good things
is that we're going

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:90%
to have a lot of revelations.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:84%
More knowledge that the
public, we as outsiders,

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:84%
will have about how
our government runs,

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:84%
about spiritual realities,
about things like aliens.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 20 years ago, if the
news that's coming out about,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:84%
maybe, pilots looking
at-- and stuff,

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.422 align:middle line:84%
that would be the news
cycle for six months.

00:22:41.422 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Barely made a blip.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's
like OK, aliens.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.000 align:middle line:90%
And what's next?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And 6 o'clock, we'll talk
about something else.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
time of revelations.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:55.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if it was even
portended in biblical times

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.903 align:middle line:84%
that there would be a
period of revelations.

00:22:56.903 --> 00:22:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Because if there
were ever a time,

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:90%
this certainly seems to be it.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.315 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
it's interesting

00:23:01.315 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that in the mid--
right around 2015,

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
2016, when we entered this
period, you had Wikileaks.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:84%
You've got all of this stuff,
this dump of information

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:90%
coming into the world.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And at first, the reaction
was, we have to stamp it down.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But as 2016 onwards
happened, you can't.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we're in
an outsider period.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:90%
You can't contain the wind.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.150 align:middle line:90%
You can't contain space.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Space is all-pervasive.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And governments and
authorities and so forth that

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.825 align:middle line:84%
want to hold on to
knowledge are going

00:23:33.825 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:90%
to-- they're going to fail.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.617 align:middle line:84%
If I'm advising
people, and higher-ups,

00:23:39.617 --> 00:23:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say, listen,
release the information,

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:90%
but put your own spin on it.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.065 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you can at
least guide it in the direction

00:23:47.065 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:90%
you want to guide it.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:90%
But you can't hold it in.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.162 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can't hold it in.

00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And as the consumer of
all of this information,

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
one thing that
we're really tasked

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:84%
with doing-- which
we have not had

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:84%
to be until now, in any serious,
mass way, a collective way,

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.650 align:middle line:90%
is the lesson of discernment.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Discernment
is everything-- viveka.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Viveko?

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:08.663 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Viveka?

00:24:08.663 --> 00:24:10.100 align:middle line:84%
In, Sanskrit, the
word is viveka.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Nitya anitya vastu viveka.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:84%
To know the difference between
what is ultimately real

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.628 align:middle line:90%
and what is not real.

00:24:16.628 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is
the biggest challenge

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.595 align:middle line:90%
facing the planet right now.

00:24:19.595 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And
in the old days,

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.640 align:middle line:84%
before this outsider period,
we relied on our experts--

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:84%
on our journalists,
on our politicians,

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.460 align:middle line:84%
on our priests and priestesses,
and so forth, to tell us,

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.530 align:middle line:90%
this is real, this is not real.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.083 align:middle line:84%
As we enter the outsider
period, we've realized, hey,

00:24:34.083 --> 00:24:35.250 align:middle line:90%
these people aren't perfect.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
actually lying to us.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:90%
Aw, hell no.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.290 align:middle line:90%
We're throwing them all out.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:90%
So we're in that now.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:84%
We will come back,
as I said earlier,

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.440 align:middle line:84%
to the point of respecting
and honoring the experts.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:90%
We're not there yet.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.947 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a full
kind of a clean slate.

00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they're
not trustworthy yet.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.770 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.312 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they haven't
earned my trust.

00:24:54.312 --> 00:24:55.112 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:24:55.112 --> 00:24:55.912 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:55.912 --> 00:24:56.712 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:56.712 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, we go into the kind of
fun stuff around disclosure--

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.460 align:middle line:84%
2021, 20 years after
the big disclosure

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.220 align:middle line:84%
project at the National
Press Club in Washington, DC.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, "New York
Times" is the vehicle that they

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:90%
decided to break this through--

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:84%
just a drip of it, a
drip feed to the public.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:90%
It's been around forever.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at it from the
historical perspective

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:90%
of the Vedas.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Because they do mention
people, and flying machines,

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:90%
and nuclear devastation.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.510 align:middle line:90%
All of these things are there.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that in
the period we're in now.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the Vedic--
my inroads into this

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:84%
is always the Vedic tradition
and the astrological tradition.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was always
agnostic about aliens.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.640 align:middle line:84%
But some clients said,
well, do a chart on it.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.450 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, we'll do a chart on.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:90%
So we looked at the chart.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.530 align:middle line:90%
And I've done two charts so far.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.275 align:middle line:84%
The first clearly showed,
this is a real phenomenon.

00:25:54.275 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:84%
This is not-- it's not
someone's imagination.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's in
the Vedic texts, right?

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes, in some ways.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:84%
In the Vedic text,
they talk about--

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:84%
the difference being is
that in the Vedic text,

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
otherworldly beings
are sort of like what

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:90%
the Elohim are in the Bible.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:90%
They are--

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same thing.

00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: They
are beings that you

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:84%
have to do a certain amount
of penance and personal

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:24.470 align:middle line:84%
purification to be
able to have access to.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:84%
In the Vedic tradition, it
talks about these heroes

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:84%
who go through penance, and
then the gods come down.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, the word for gods
in the Vedic tradition

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:84%
is deva, where our word
"divine" comes from.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But the word deva
means a bright being.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.700 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the root
"dev," which means to shine.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So a deva is a divine being
that, first of all, shines.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.820 align:middle line:90%
A god or a deva is also--

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:90%
deva means "to play."

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So they are playful beings
that sort of play about with us

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
because they can, kind of the
Greek myths where the gods--

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Athena and Zeus,
and they're like,

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.630 align:middle line:84%
oh, let's see what we'll
do with these mortals.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And the third meaning
is "to gamble."

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of fits
together with "to play,"

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
that they can be
naughty sometimes too.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.140 align:middle line:84%
They're not always
these divine things.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.500 align:middle line:84%
But the deva is in the
Vedic tradition are not

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:84%
G-O-D. They're
not "the Supreme."

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.710 align:middle line:84%
They are-- so let
me ask, you would

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.830 align:middle line:84%
you say that elemental beings,
like mountain spirits or river

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.530 align:middle line:90%
spirits, are aliens?

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
alien to us, but it

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean they're
aliens as we classically

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.350 align:middle line:84%
understand
third-dimensional beings

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:90%
from off-planet cultures.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Or, say,
ghosts or spirits.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.590 align:middle line:84%
They're-- the way the
Vedas categorizes,

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:55.540 align:middle line:84%
all of these otherworldly
beings have their own individual

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.210 align:middle line:84%
realms that you can
access in different ways.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of them you access through
a certain type of practice,

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and then you can see
this type of deity.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And the way I liken it is,
let's say you go to the bank

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:90%
and you know the teller.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're good friends
with the teller.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And the teller is probably
likely going to give you,

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.390 align:middle line:84%
oh, here's a free
check, or here, I'll

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.938 align:middle line:84%
take off this
transaction fee for you.

00:28:20.938 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:84%
They have a limited amount
of things they can do,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.360 align:middle line:90%
but they can help you.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:84%
If you know the branch
manager, that's even better.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:84%
You get a preferred
checking account.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.765 align:middle line:90%
You get upgrades.

00:28:29.765 --> 00:28:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going up a realm.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: We're
going up a realm.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
But what if you know
the CEO of Wells Fargo,

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the bank is?

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have access
to more benefits.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And then there's even
higher from there.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, in the
spiritual realms, these--

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:84%
you can say they're lower
entities-- lower meaning,

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.950 align:middle line:84%
they're not below us, but
they are like the teller.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:84%
They have limited
ways of helping us.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Then there are ones above
them and above them.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
there is a divine--

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.990 align:middle line:84%
the divine which is
singular, plural--

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.350 align:middle line:90%
it encompasses everything.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think the essence of
most spiritual traditions

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:84%
is that, yes, you can access
all of the other deities,

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.260 align:middle line:90%
and they're very helpful--

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.000 align:middle line:90%
these energies.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, goddess of the
river, help me.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And you connect with
her when you go hiking,

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and you have a
magical experience.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's great.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, your
connection to your source

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.330 align:middle line:84%
is what it's all about-- knowing
the CEO, or the president,

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, in this
analogy, will open up

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:90%
all of the doors for you.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bhagavad
Gita, which is

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.040 align:middle line:84%
one of the seminal texts
of the Vedic tradition,

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Krishna is talking--

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
by the way, Krishna and
Krista, and Krishta,

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:90%
are etymologically similar.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And the word Christ or
Christos is a title.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not-- Yeshua was his name.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Christos was his title.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Christos, which means the
Messiah, the anointed one.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:00.350 align:middle line:90%
They are etymologically similar.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:84%
They indicate an
anointed person.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bringer of
light and information.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.442 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Which is where
the word "deva" comes from,

00:30:07.442 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:90%
an illuminated being.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have human
beings who are born

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:84%
on earth who have
illumination, because they

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.770 align:middle line:90%
are connected to the divine.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Krishna, in this case,
is teaching his friend.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:84%
He's saying, listen, all of
the things that you worship,

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm behind them.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.830 align:middle line:84%
I meaning my essence
as God, as the divine.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I am behind them.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Or in Christ's case, my father.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:90%
My father speaks through me.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:90%
I and my Father are one.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I think the teaching--
yes, there are beings.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they come to visit.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Are they the same
as what is talked

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:90%
about in the Vedic tradition?

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.595 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what's talked
about in the Vedic tradition

00:30:50.595 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:90%
are spiritual experiences.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But in some cases,
they do talk about,

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.870 align:middle line:84%
a ship comes down with
the sound of thunder,

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.020 align:middle line:84%
light it's blinding,
I got up on the ship,

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and now I could see the
little trees below me.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And we went to places so far
away, where there's deserts.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.030 align:middle line:90%
And they talk about this.

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, they were
flying somewhere.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:90%
There's that experience as well.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:19.520 align:middle line:84%
But I think the conclusion
is that to earn that, you

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.870 align:middle line:90%
had to do great penance.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.960 align:middle line:84%
You had to purify yourself,
to a certain degree,

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.580 align:middle line:84%
to be able to access
that experience.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it comes
back down to us to--

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Always
comes back to us.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.870 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, if you
look at the reflections

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.580 align:middle line:84%
in the Old Testament,
for example.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.087 align:middle line:90%
Similarly-- well, Chris Hardy--

00:31:42.087 --> 00:31:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know Chris Hardy's work.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:84%
She's a French woman who is
the author of several books,

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.160 align:middle line:84%
but one is called "Wars
of the Anunnaki Gods,"

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.260 align:middle line:84%
deconstructing the stuff that
Sitchin deconstructed even

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:90%
further.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And looking at these beings
that came and essentially set up

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.670 align:middle line:90%
shop as our gods--

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:01.260 align:middle line:90%
our terrestrial gods.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was punishment if
you didn't behave correctly.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't resonate with
that message at all.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:84%
The whole notion that others
have come and set up shop

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and demanded our fealty
because they were, perhaps,

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:19.020 align:middle line:90%
more technologically advanced.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were more advanced
telepathically in other ways,

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.170 align:middle line:90%
and had a commanding presence.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I look at that now,
and there is some kind

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.180 align:middle line:84%
of interesting thing
going on, which

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I teased a bit in our open
here, that as we don't trust

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:84%
the religious
institutions anymore--

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.490 align:middle line:84%
we don't trust any
institutions anymore, in mass.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:84%
We're falling away
from all of them.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:43.947 align:middle line:84%
That something has to come
in and fill that void.

00:32:43.947 --> 00:32:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I would like to know,
from your perspective,

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.590 align:middle line:84%
after you looked at this
chart on aliens, what

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.330 align:middle line:84%
would be indicated
for humanity to say,

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.660 align:middle line:84%
oh, maybe those
guys can save us?

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Again, always abrogating
responsibility,

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:58.620 align:middle line:90%
if we're not responsible.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Those
guys also live and die.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
They're also subject to the
same laws that we're subject to.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.630 align:middle line:90%
They may live a little longer.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:11.520 align:middle line:84%
They may do a little
bit differently.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Knowing those guys and
having them say these--

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:90%
asking the teller for help.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But what about our
temptation to, once again,

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:25.440 align:middle line:84%
look beyond
ourselves for saving,

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.750 align:middle line:84%
instead of really
embracing with what

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I call-- you're calling the
big connection, beyond the CEO?

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self, your soul,
your connection with all,

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:90%
and the creator.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: We are
here as a little--

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.310 align:middle line:84%
what do they call
it in "Star Trek"?

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Bags of mostly-- ugly
bags of mostly water.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.050 align:middle line:84%
In that one episode
of old "Star Trek,"

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:50.370 align:middle line:84%
the crystalline beings says,
"ugly bags of mostly water."

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:51.870 align:middle line:90%
That's how it sees us.

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:90%
We are these entities--

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:84%
we're limited in what we can
do physically, and so forth.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's natural
to look beyond us.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Also, because we
know, inside of us,

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.530 align:middle line:90%
that we shouldn't be limited.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:06.210 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
us-- it knows, it remembers.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:06.555 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is unlimited.

00:34:06.555 --> 00:34:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: We have
intimations of immortality,

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.159 align:middle line:84%
is what Wordsworth used
to say-- a beautiful poem.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:11.992 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:34:11.992 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: That we remember--
part of us remembers what it

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.219 align:middle line:84%
feels like to have that
freedom of being one with all--

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:23.260 align:middle line:84%
omnipotent, omniscient,
and so forth.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's natural to
look beyond ourselves.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.460 align:middle line:84%
What our spiritual traditions
are trying to teach us is that,

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.465 align:middle line:90%
ultimately, that journey is--

00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The teller.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.600 align:middle line:90%
The bank teller is--

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.909 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes, is limited
in how they can help us.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:39.659 align:middle line:84%
And it's by going within that
you cannot access your inner

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:40.949 align:middle line:90%
CEO.

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, the cool thing
about the Vedic tradition

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.460 align:middle line:84%
that I appreciate
as an astrologer

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:51.220 align:middle line:84%
is, they talk about phenomena
that happened 9,000,

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.130 align:middle line:90%
10,000, 12,000 years ago.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of one of
the astrological texts that

00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:00.840 align:middle line:84%
says when Saturn or Mars passed
through this tiny little part

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.780 align:middle line:84%
of the zodiac by
the star Aldebaran--

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.840 align:middle line:84%
it's called the
carriage of Rohini.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a little triangle.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Then massive flooding will
happen unlike anything you've

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.410 align:middle line:84%
ever seen that completely
destroys the world.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, from an
astronomical standpoint,

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.510 align:middle line:84%
that has not happened
until the last melting

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:27.820 align:middle line:84%
of the glaciers in
9,500 BC, and then again

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.390 align:middle line:90%
around 10,000 to 11,000 BC.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.560 align:middle line:90%
That's 12,000 years.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's talked
about as the Younger Dryas

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:34.930 align:middle line:90%
period and such.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: We have
archaeological evidence

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that there was
great flooding then.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about it as
if they had observed it.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.920 align:middle line:90%
The Vedic record goes back--

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that's the part that gets me,
is that some somebody drew

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.710 align:middle line:84%
a correlation between, hey,
this planet's going here

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:90%
and there's great flooding.

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:54.490 align:middle line:90%
And they wrote it down.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And we know,
astronomically, that hasn't

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:90%
happened since back then.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So the Vedic tradition
goes way back.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
appreciate what they

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.280 align:middle line:84%
have to say about
astrology, for one,

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.655 align:middle line:84%
but also humankind's
connection to their source.

00:36:11.655 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The divine.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.738 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And it always
defaults back to, yes, you

00:36:14.738 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:84%
can access the teller
and the branch manager,

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.560 align:middle line:84%
but isn't it best to
really know the CEO?

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Couldn't agree more.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where all
discernment on all levels

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:28.160 align:middle line:84%
comes from, in my opinion,
is being able to access

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that part, and that connection
with the all-- all information,

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.020 align:middle line:90%
all creativity.

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And that said-- you
mentioned this a bit ago,

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:41.270 align:middle line:84%
this whole notion of these
bright, shiny beings that

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:42.350 align:middle line:90%
have come historically.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:90%
And they're in the Vedas.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.637 align:middle line:90%
They're mentioned elsewhere.

00:36:44.637 --> 00:36:47.720 align:middle line:84%
They're mentioned in
indigenous tribes--

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Freddy Silva's books call
them "the shining ones."

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Always light.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of them call them, in
certain eras, the followers

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.260 align:middle line:90%
of Horus-- always about light.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think, while
I've just said

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to be
careful about just giving all

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.840 align:middle line:84%
our power over to yet another
version of what we perceive

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.500 align:middle line:84%
as shining ones,
there are actually

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.620 align:middle line:84%
shining ones who
are here now, who

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.990 align:middle line:84%
are helping us
develop discernment,

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to stay rational,
to stay out of fear.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:84%
These people do
exist on this planet,

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to help humanity
move to that next level.

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So to keep an eye out
and not ignore it.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And usually, they're
pretty interesting--

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.540 align:middle line:90%
I've met a few of them.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.360 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty unpretentious,
pretty amazing people.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:36.380 align:middle line:84%
You do, I think, a beautiful
job of establishing

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:41.090 align:middle line:84%
that road of
non-fearful reactivity

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and calm around the notion
that life is cyclical.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.010 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
will come to pass,

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.810 align:middle line:84%
but you have to be
responsible amidst it.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:49.477 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
you're a shining one,

00:37:49.477 --> 00:37:51.920 align:middle line:84%
but you certainly are
valuable at this time.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.100 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are others
that are like this.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: My
teachers-- and I've

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:84%
had the very good fortune
of meeting truly illuminated

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.490 align:middle line:90%
beings in this life.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
in their presence,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.680 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of a real
guru or a real saint,

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.380 align:middle line:90%
there's an aura.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:17.090 align:middle line:84%
They used to say that, when the
Buddha was coming to a certain

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.360 align:middle line:84%
village, within a 20-mile
radius, even the farmers--

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.640 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't-- they didn't
even know he was coming.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.070 align:middle line:84%
They would all of a sudden
drop the plow and just kind of

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.720 align:middle line:90%
sit and think about life.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Like, you could
feel that radiance.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And unless you've
been around a saint,

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to describe it.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But once you have been
in that presence--

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:39.715 align:middle line:90%
which is why saints and very--

00:38:39.715 --> 00:38:41.090 align:middle line:84%
like you said,
illuminated beings

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.715 align:middle line:84%
are so important
to our evolution.

00:38:42.715 --> 00:38:43.590 align:middle line:90%
And they're here now.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they're here now.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:45.515 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: In human form.

00:38:45.515 --> 00:38:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.233 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: When you
sit in their presence,

00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:49.550 align:middle line:90%
it really changes everything.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Little by little, it starts
to chip away at your darkness.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all
mirrors, and we've

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:90%
got dust and crust and all--

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
but underneath it,
we're pure mirrors.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.500 align:middle line:90%
We reflect the divine light.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And being around teachers
and doing our own inner work,

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:08.780 align:middle line:84%
it slowly polishes
that mirror so you

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.880 align:middle line:90%
can reflect better and better.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And you can't undo that.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Once you've been
around a saintly person

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and you've received
that kind of initiation,

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.890 align:middle line:90%
you can't forget it.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:23.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you've
toasted the sesame seed.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.398 align:middle line:84%
You can't put in the pot
again and have it sprout.

00:39:26.398 --> 00:39:27.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to sprout.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.120 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
follow that path.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.180 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it's
important for people to, again,

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:39.080 align:middle line:84%
have our senses
open on all levels--

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.400 align:middle line:90%
our mind, not our brain.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But our mind truly
open to knowing

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:47.840 align:middle line:84%
when we are starting to see
these people, or these beings,

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.040 align:middle line:84%
that can help us develop
ourselves further.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
in a trite sense.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean going
to a workshop.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.890 align:middle line:84%
There's just something that's
coming out of you in response

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:58.777 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:39:58.777 --> 00:40:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: One great
thing about India's culture

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.090 align:middle line:90%
is the respect for the guru.

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, the guru can
be-- if I'm trying

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.070 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to sing
something, for example,

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:09.050 align:middle line:84%
they could be an
8-year-old boy who

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:90%
is not my guru in other areas.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.770 align:middle line:84%
But in this area, I
bow and touch his feet,

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:15.470 align:middle line:90%
because he's the authority.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Is a deep respect for people
with knowledge or understanding

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.350 align:middle line:90%
greater than ours.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And one thing about America--
which is cool about us,

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.320 align:middle line:90%
but it's also uncool--

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.260 align:middle line:90%
is that we don't have that.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.120 align:middle line:90%
We kind of diss people.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.100 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that
abiding respect

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.860 align:middle line:90%
for the principle of wisdom.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.633 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I don't like the
way that guy dresses,

00:40:38.633 --> 00:40:40.050 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not going
to listen to him.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We still don't have
any respect for, kind of,

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.800 align:middle line:84%
the sacredness of
life in general.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Sacredness, yeah.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.584 align:middle line:84%
Which is also cool,
because we are--

00:40:45.584 --> 00:40:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inventive.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yes.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.780 align:middle line:90%
It has its good side too, but--

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Industrious.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: --respect
for the sacred

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.240 align:middle line:84%
is something I think
everyone can cultivate.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:02.035 align:middle line:84%
And even if it comes
from nonstandard sources,

00:41:02.035 --> 00:41:03.410 align:middle line:84%
from someone you
wouldn't expect.

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:05.820 align:middle line:90%


00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was in India,
I went to Tiruvannamalai,

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Mount Arunachala.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And we sat in
Ramana's cave, and had

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.440 align:middle line:84%
a very interesting experience,
I've got to tell you.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.240 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was--

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.290 align:middle line:90%
I thought, am I making--

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.060 align:middle line:90%
am I, you know?

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.790 align:middle line:84%
But I walked by his-- you
know that portrait of him

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:26.120 align:middle line:84%
reclining, in the ashram
down below, the cave?

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I went by and he smiled at
me, and then he winked at me.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, is
this happening?

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.730 align:middle line:90%
So I asked one of the people.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:38.030 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, my God,
you got the-- he played

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.650 align:middle line:90%
with you a little bit.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Another young Scottish
guy in our group

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:90%
said, I'm losing my mind.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I walked by this portrait
and he smiled at me.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.210 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm losing my mind.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:48.747 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, no, sweetie.

00:41:48.747 --> 00:41:49.580 align:middle line:90%
He smiled at me too.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Apparently he does this to
certain unsuspecting people--

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: He likes tourists.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:53.450 align:middle line:84%
He's like, hey,
how are you doing?

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.408 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --passing by.

00:41:54.408 --> 00:41:56.720 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the most profound
experience of that trip

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:90%
was a little woman--

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I think her name was
Siva Sakthi Ammaiya, who

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.070 align:middle line:84%
had a little ashram
that was packed.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there wasn't
even sitting room left.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Twice a day, for 15
minutes, she would come in.

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.280 align:middle line:90%
And she was tiny.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And she would walk in.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.230 align:middle line:84%
She'd have a little
smile, sit down,

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.670 align:middle line:90%
and people would sit with her.

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:18.890 align:middle line:90%
And the room was--

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.370 align:middle line:84%
it was palpable, the
upliftment, the refinement

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.870 align:middle line:90%
of the energy in the room.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:25.580 align:middle line:90%
One time, I opened my eyes.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.660 align:middle line:90%
My son was there too.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.118 align:middle line:84%
He was in another
part of the room,

00:42:28.118 --> 00:42:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and he opened his
eyes, coincidentally,

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.300 align:middle line:84%
at the same time and
looked at her, thinking,

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.990 align:middle line:84%
what does she do while
we have our eyes closed?

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:39.800 align:middle line:84%
She had these balls
of energy shooting out

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.290 align:middle line:84%
at whoever she was
targeting to help

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:43.940 align:middle line:90%
while we had our eyes closed.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.410 align:middle line:90%
And we both saw her doing that.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And then she turned
around and did it to us.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.650 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, boom!

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.330 align:middle line:90%
It was like, thank you.

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was so powerful with
not a single word ever spoken.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Just being in that presence
was beautiful-- not

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.830 align:middle line:90%
asking for your fealty.

00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Not asking for anything.

00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: Yeah.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- it's transmission.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the Tantric
tradition of-- or also,

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:84%
the Vedantic tradition
of transmission.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.936 align:middle line:84%
Once you've felt that and
you've been in that, you know.

00:43:09.936 --> 00:43:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Another way is when you go
to one of these leaf readers,

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and they look at your
leaf that was written

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.380 align:middle line:84%
300 or 400 years
ago, and they say,

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.968 align:middle line:90%
your mother's name is Renee.

00:43:22.968 --> 00:43:24.260 align:middle line:90%
How the hell did you know that?

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind of leaf
reader are you talking about?

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Not the grounds in
your coffee cup.

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Not the
grounds in your coffee.

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:29.680 align:middle line:90%
These are called nadi--

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:31.360 align:middle line:90%
N-A-D-I-- leaves.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, about 100 years
ago, the tradition

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.400 align:middle line:84%
was more or less intact, and you
could go to a nadi leaf reader.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It was an ordeal,
because it's usually

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:45.580 align:middle line:84%
in this little villages, muddy
places, you have to-- anyway,

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.747 align:middle line:84%
by the time you got there--
and you have translators

00:43:47.747 --> 00:43:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and they
have to look for your leaf.

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:51.190 align:middle line:90%
You spend a week or two there.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Finally, they find your leaf.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And your whole life is
written in that leaf.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Like,
wait a minute.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've
never heard of this.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Somebody
knows something here.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: This is before
Google, before Facebook.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:90%
So they're not googling you.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling you your
mother and father's name.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.830 align:middle line:84%
This is where you
have two divorces.

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:06.640 align:middle line:90%
You have one brother.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.180 align:middle line:90%
You're this?

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:07.660 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.460 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, uh, yeah.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.485 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:10.485 --> 00:44:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And then they go
off and tell you

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:15.140 align:middle line:84%
about the past life that got
you here, what you should do,

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.130 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, these days,
there are a lot of--

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.740 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of social
engineering going on.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And people have used
this sacred tradition

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:25.610 align:middle line:90%
and kind of made it their own.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.585 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot of
charlatans as well.

00:44:27.585 --> 00:44:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everywhere.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.043 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: And so they'll be
like, your mother's name starts

00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:31.870 align:middle line:90%
with P, right?

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:32.650 align:middle line:90%
And you'd be like, no.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.570 align:middle line:84%
No, R, R. It starts
with R. And you're like,

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.370 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it's R. Right?

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So they arrive at it through
a process of deduction.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:40.720 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
careful with that.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't invalidate
the original tradition

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.310 align:middle line:90%
that really does exist.

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Once you have
access to that, you

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:52.580 align:middle line:84%
realize, OK, there are
people who have access

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.360 align:middle line:84%
to spiritual energy,
as you experience,

00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual knowledge
that is not arrived

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:02.180 align:middle line:90%
at through the normal means.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.860 align:middle line:90%
There is something out there.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And let me open myself
to it as much as I can,

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:09.770 align:middle line:84%
hang around people
who know things.

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And just by virtue of
hanging around them--

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.480 align:middle line:84%
it's called satsangha
in Sanskrit,

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.910 align:middle line:84%
meaning hanging
out with the wise--

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:20.055 align:middle line:84%
my own vibration
gets heightened.

00:45:20.055 --> 00:45:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a
good time for that.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.222 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: It's
a good action plan.

00:45:23.222 --> 00:45:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all tied up in
our homes watching whatever news

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:27.380 align:middle line:90%
source you watch.

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And algorithms are
programming and targeting us.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: And it's our own--

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:30.470 align:middle line:84%
we're just hanging out
with our own brain.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:31.512 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Feedback loops.

00:45:31.512 --> 00:45:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHOKOISKY: Hang around
good people, and together,

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.460 align:middle line:90%
we lift ourselves up.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.860 align:middle line:84%
That's, I think, maybe
one of the best solutions

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.160 align:middle line:84%
for the outsider period, is know
that you do fit in somewhere.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:48.710 align:middle line:84%
You're not alone in your
views and in your stance.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Because when you feel alone,
you start to resent people.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.000 align:middle line:90%
How can they speak that way?

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.490 align:middle line:10%
How can these
people be this way?

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:56.540 align:middle line:90%
There are others like me.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And the wound of
abandonment gets mollified.

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:06.425 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel so abandoned when
you have a group, a satsanga.

00:46:06.425 --> 00:46:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Simon.

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHOKOISKY: My pleasure.

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.613 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Enlightening
on many levels.

00:46:09.613 --> 00:46:10.730 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:12.710 align:middle line:10%
And we'll do this
again, of course.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:15.230 align:middle line:10%
