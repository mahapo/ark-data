>> REGINA MEREDITH: With the
increasing levels of pure

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:10%
insanity playing out
in the world around us,

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:10%
I find critical thought and
clear thinking to be soothing

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:10%
to quiet down all the noise.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
philosophers is with us again

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the effects of
polarization on our societies

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:90%
and as individuals.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
To keep us polarized,
whether politically,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:84%
culturally, or
economically, keeps

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:84%
us infantilized
as a civilization.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But how do we find
our way forward?

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.629 align:middle line:90%
That's the big question.

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And Neil, it's so
good to have you back.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> NEIL KRAMER:
Pleasure to be with you.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:84%
You and I-- we were
talking off camera

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and we have both come to
a point in our own lives

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
personally, in our own paths
of knowledge and study,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:84%
that we feel it's time that
things that have always

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle line:84%
been held back and kept
secret aren't secret anymore.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And we are both part of
the hermetic tradition.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And you've been on that
path longer than I.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.007 align:middle line:84%
For how many years
have you been?

00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: 20 years.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 20 years.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a good
head start on this

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's
really important now

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
as we're needing clear
thinking in societies at large

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.079 align:middle line:84%
and people are frustrated trying
to find it and can't find it.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Even though this
isn't a particularly

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.900 align:middle line:84%
unilateral decision
that I've made--

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I've even discussed it with
them saying at what point do you

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:90%
invite people in?

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And I want to hear
your understanding

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:84%
of that inexperience
and the whole notion

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
of the appropriateness of times
for keeping things to yourself,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:84%
or secret, or quiet,
versus releasing them

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
in these periods of
history that require it.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Sure.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:10%
Well, initially the
secrecy was literally

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:10%
to keep people from
being executed.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:10%
So when the-- what
I call Empire--

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.575 align:middle line:10%
this system of containment
originally came into being,

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:10%
it soon realized that more
effective than militarization

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:10%
was the sequestration
of religion.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they used
something that originally

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.040 align:middle line:84%
was called Romanism, which
later became Christianity.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate all the
private practice.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
All the private streams of
indigenous wisdom traditions;

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
European mystical
traditions; European wisdom

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:90%
of 10,000 years old--

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
way predating even
Vedic scriptures,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and Sufi esoteric
wisdom and stuff.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So there was this giant effort
to crush European wisdom,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.130 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
refined, so cultivated.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Which sounds funny
to say that today,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
because we often associate
that with the East, which,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
of course, has its own
colors and textures,

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and its own particular
kind of ornamentation.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But as a European, of
course, I associate

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:90%
with my soil, my heritage.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And so Empire sought
to get rid of that.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So the people who
refused to do that set up

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:84%
these organizations using
initiations, where only degreed

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:84%
initiates, whether it was
hermetic, or Golden Dawn,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.390 align:middle line:84%
or Rosicrucian, or masonry, or
anthroposophy, or theosophy,

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- lots
of different schools

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and literally
hundreds of subgroups.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
The initiations
served two purposes.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
One was to prove the
student's devotion.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: And to demonstrate
worthiness for real

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.765 align:middle line:84%
world-shaping power to
alchemically change reality.

00:03:57.765 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And the second
one, as I say, was

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:84%
to protect the group from
execution, which was obviously

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:90%
the worst case scenario.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:90%
But also exile.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So it would be quite common to
take a small religious group

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.370 align:middle line:84%
from many counties in
England and exile them.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:84%
And say, we won't kill
you, because we're

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
very civilized people,
but you must leave.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever preach,
if you ever speak,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:84%
or if we ever catch
you practicing

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
this independent spirituality,
then we will prosecute,

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.760 align:middle line:90%
which will lead to death.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So that was originally
why that came about.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's just
such a fear pattern

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that that's been carried right
through the centuries really.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And as I was saying to you
earlier this afternoon,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
there's a great American scholar
and mystical practitioner

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.154 align:middle line:90%
called Paul Foster Case.

00:04:51.154 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of
the first people

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:84%
who released these terrible
earth-shattering secrets

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:84%
in a correspondence course in
the late 1800s, early 1900s.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was a shock, because he'd
fallen out with the Golden Dawn

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:90%
and there was conflict.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well
you know what, I'm

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
going to release this stuff
in a principled, rational,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:84%
sensitive, responsible
way-- in my way.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to share
those wisdom seeds

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:90%
with everyone I see fit to.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.920 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And most of the seeds,
people didn't recognize them.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Most of them, no one
knew what that meant.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.714 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Most people just
thought that's too difficult,

00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:90%
that's too hard.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.559 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:90%
So they went away.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And the few seekers and
serious spiritual humans

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to better themselves
and to become something

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.440 align:middle line:84%
more than just a comfortable
man, a comfortable woman.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to have an
ascendancy about them.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Took those seeds and
began to take them home,

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
as you might say,
and germinate them.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Privately-- it's thought now
among some quarters the higher

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.010 align:middle line:84%
ups within this hermetic
order of the Golden Dawn,

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
which is just one
hermetic order-- just one,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:90%
but a very prominent one--

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
were actually privately
pleased with what Case did--

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Paul Foster Case.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And his dissemination
responsibly-- mind--

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:90%
of this great knowledge.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So although they were
publicly embarrassed by it,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.507 align:middle line:90%
privately with the bloody--

00:06:23.507 --> 00:06:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They knew
it had to happen.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.545 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: --cigars.

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
They were like you know it's
probably not such a bad thing

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
that this guy does
this, because it's

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:84%
protected by virtue of
the knowledge itself,

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:90%
it's impenetrable to the unwise.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.066 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Whereas the
wise man, the wise one,

00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:41.589 align:middle line:84%
will take it and feel the
impulse within it and go away

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and do something with it.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.376 align:middle line:84%
And if that's not OK, I
don't know what it is.

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:46.500 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's
self-selecting--

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.075 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: It's self-selecting.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --because of that.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: That's a
nice way of saying it.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320 align:middle line:90%
It totally is.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
the difference today

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:84%
is that one very much
initiates oneself.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So there is a formal path of
initiation, which I certainly

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:90%
took.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
an individual path,

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.290 align:middle line:84%
where years of solitude, years
of study, years of error,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
years of failure,
years of heartbreak.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Map that negativity
in life before you

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:84%
can find the equilibrium
to where wisdom lives.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's the difference now
that there is total freedom

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It may sometimes
seem a funny thing

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
to say in today's political
climate, which we'll get to,

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:90%
but there is total freedom now.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:84%
It's unlikely anyone
is going to execute you

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:90%
for what you believe.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So initiation is
self-initiation now.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: That's the big shift.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And from their point of view
also, throughout the millennia,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:84%
some of the more guarded aspects
of the knowledge also have--

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:90%
and this is true--

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.215 align:middle line:84%
they do have the
power to be misused

00:07:53.215 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
by someone who is really
quite brilliant, can

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
grok all the concepts, and then
use it for a wrong purpose.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the same
with the technology

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:90%
that exists in our world too.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's no different within
the deep understanding

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:84%
of a cult or esoteric sciences
and the misuse of them.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is one reason
it was also kept secret.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.206 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: It is to protect
the knowledge from falling

00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:90%
into the wrong hands.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: So only
through typically 1, 2, 3,

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:84%
7 years initiation, 7 years
of devotional practice.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Just like a sadhu
would show devotion

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.750 align:middle line:84%
in India or a Zen monk
would show devotion

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
over decades in Japan, so too
we had my European ancestry,

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and Anglo-Saxon and
Celtic regions, where

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.299 align:middle line:90%
there was 7 years of devotion.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I always joke it's
like medical school.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't let you go
out with a scalpel--

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: --too soon.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's the same.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, I
think that that needs

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:84%
to be stressed as well as
self-protection, in terms

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.510 align:middle line:84%
of having being ostracized or
even murdered in times past.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:90%
But those times have passed.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is this: that
these ancient orders really

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
are dying, they're
collapsing, for lack of--

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Yeah, they're
certainly becoming very

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:84%
concentrated and very isolated,
which I think from many

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:84%
people's point of view, it
looks like they're dying.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they can die.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.387 align:middle line:90%
But like say--

00:09:24.387 --> 00:09:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They can go dormant
as they have in the past.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Classical music
totally disappeared for a long

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
time and then came back
about 100 years ago in great

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
strength, as people were able to
access recordings of it again.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And then they went
back and looked

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
at Mozart and Beethoven and
Schumann and Bach and whatnot.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:84%
So it can go
dormant I would say.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I'd say, that's
really more what's impending

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:53.210 align:middle line:84%
right now, because we have
been essentially almost forced

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.360 align:middle line:84%
into these extreme roles-- have
polarized thought and immature

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And as I said in
the beginning, this

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
infantilized state,
where a show can

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:84%
be put on on the TV
calling it conservative

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:84%
or calling it
progressive or liberal.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
matter anymore.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.740 align:middle line:90%
It's all a circus.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:90%
It's all bread and circus now.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
we've become infants.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:90%
We can't discern.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:84%
We're too overwhelmed
to take time to discern

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and this requires clear
thinking and discernment.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Sure.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Like I was saying, the
first path of control

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
is the weapon, the
boot, force, the fist.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:84%
The second path is the
Abrahamic religions, which

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:90%
seeds of truth in all of them--

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Christian, Judaic,
Islam, whatever--

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
but easily sequestered
and that becomes a thing.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Now they've done away with that.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.810 align:middle line:84%
What we have now is culture
is the control mechanism.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: So the culture
itself, the mainstream culture,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.560 align:middle line:84%
particularly in Europe,
particularly in America,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:90%
is world culture.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:57.889 align:middle line:84%
And those words and images
are devised in small groups

00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:59.930 align:middle line:84%
by small numbers of people
who you could probably

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
fit in this studio if you
packed them in like sardines.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
a vast number of people.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to probe the
origins of that in this show

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:90%
perhaps, but they are there.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And those words come from
many places in New York

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and the images come from
many places in California.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And those words and
images form the culture

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:84%
of fashion, and music,
and movies, and clothes,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and the language we use,
whether it's OK to have a gun,

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
whether it's OK to have
a pen, whether it's

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.750 align:middle line:84%
OK to speak with total
no-taboo liberty,

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:84%
or whether one should
feel a certain way

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:90%
about a race or an ethnicity.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:48.216 align:middle line:84%
Those things are determined by
these small number of people.

00:11:48.216 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't happen
organically as we've talked

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:90%
about before on this show.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So the culture is the
control mechanism.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: And polarization--

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the world is
a polarized force,

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
if I may talk about
that for a minute.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Nature is polarized
but only in its stance to find

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:90%
that center point.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Yeah.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:84%
The polarization
principle in hermeticism

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:84%
is nicely and simply discussed
in this little book called

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:90%
"The Kybalion."

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:10%
The origin of it is
mysterious, but we

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:10%
think it was William Walker
Atkinson and Paul Foster

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:10%
Case who got together
and thought about this

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:10%
and put this little book
of principles together.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
principles is polarity,

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:84%
which is to say the world uses
this great positive negative

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
force of the solar
masculine creator

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:90%
and the lunar female destroyer.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And those two forces pull at
both ends of the spectrum,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And everything falls into
polarization in that respect--

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:84%
love, hate, courage,
despair, whatever.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And the principle of it
is that polarization,

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:84%
you have to map the negative
and know it in your heart,

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.390 align:middle line:90%
and will, and mind.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to map the positive
in a similar fashion,

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:84%
to find the center point,
to find the equilibrium.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you discover
this great secret

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.470 align:middle line:84%
that there's no such
thing as hot or cold--

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
classic example--
there is temperature.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as love and hate--

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:90%
there is feeling.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot love unless
you've hated deeply.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.860 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
feel deeply, you've

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:90%
got to be prepared for venom.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
If you want to love completely
and unconditionally, you

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:84%
need total separation,
total almost

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
despondent isolation, total
anarchy within oneself.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to feel, there
is no limit to those boundaries,

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.976 align:middle line:90%
the positive and the negative.

00:13:45.976 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
path of the human.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
violent in a manner that

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
is going to go against
somebody's informed consent.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be ugly.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:84%
It can be a path, a shadow
mapping of great beauty.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Like say H.R. Giger, the
artist, or Stockhausen

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:84%
with his incredible, bizarre
music in the '50s and '60s,

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
or my favorite Swedish
death metal bands.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
They're not just guys
playing their guitars

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of distortion,
they're mapping shadow, just

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:84%
like Byron and Shelley
and Tennyson mapped shadow

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:90%
in poetry.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So these musicians map
what is the shadow,

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
why does it pull us, how
can we talk about it?

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you can't
always put words to it,

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:84%
so we use a paintbrush, or
a guitar, or food, or sex.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Strange, subversive, crazy
sex to go to the hillside

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:84%
under the full moon and to
give this ritual emancipation,

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
this ritual liberation of self
through the sexual energy,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
a sort of European
Kundalini type thing.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So there can be positive
shadow mappings.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there are
many light shadow mappings

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:84%
in finding serenity,
peace, wholeness,

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.180 align:middle line:90%
fruitfulness in one's life.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:84%
To become a good
householder; to become

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.700 align:middle line:84%
a man of integrity; to
become a woman of substance--

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Those things show you that
this whole path is one thing.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:90%
There is no separate stuff.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:90%
It's all poles.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Everything is dual.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:84%
What mainstream
culture does, which

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:90%
is wholly owned by Empire--

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.426 align:middle line:84%
normal, organic,
natural human beings

00:15:30.426 --> 00:15:31.550 align:middle line:90%
have nothing to do with it.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't formulate it.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:84%
What mainstream
culture does is force

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.310 align:middle line:84%
these irreconcilable
poles to say

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:84%
you're a liberal
progressive or you're

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:84%
a traditional
conservative-- choose.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:90%
And both of them are wrong.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Both of them lead to decay,
decadence, and destruction.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:90%
They're both wrong.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
What they constantly
present you with

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.597 align:middle line:84%
is polarization that doesn't
function, that doesn't work.

00:15:58.597 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But that's
a good sideshow.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.955 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: So that's the trick.

00:16:01.955 --> 00:16:02.755 align:middle line:90%
It's a sideshow.

00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It keeps
you distracted.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.004 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: It's a sideshow.

00:16:05.004 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:84%
It keeps people going
around in circles.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
It keeps people going on
utterly pointless marches

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:84%
with little hats on and
signs, men and women.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.430 align:middle line:84%
It keeps people divided
by ridiculous things

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.880 align:middle line:84%
like ethnicity, which
is garbage, nonsense.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And the more you put
forward the polarization,

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.474 align:middle line:90%
the more people lose themselves.

00:16:28.474 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
individual journey.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The culture cannot
show you equilibrium.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.930 align:middle line:84%
The culture is there
to show you division.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what it is for.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And every major technology
company, every major media

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
company, every major journalist
group, every major media

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:84%
organization are complicit
in this decadence,

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.670 align:middle line:90%
this total decadence.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So without the individual
path, the collectivist path

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:90%
will always polarize.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you see, wherever
you smell collectivism,

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:06.193 align:middle line:84%
that's the telltale
stench of Empire.

00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:07.359 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree with you.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
is a point of conflict,

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:84%
certainly internally
a lot of times,

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
is women have not been
embraced by these societies

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:90%
until relatively recently.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.329 align:middle line:84%
These have all been
primarily male-dominated

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:84%
As women were in their classic,
traditional roles and they

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.430 align:middle line:90%
simply weren't--

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't made
accessible to them.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't have been allowed.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.841 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true any longer.

00:17:31.841 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:84%
In most of these organizations,
women are allowed.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:84%
But when women come into
contact with the information,

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:42.992 align:middle line:84%
at first blush, certainly
with an unknowing eye

00:17:42.992 --> 00:17:43.950 align:middle line:90%
toward what's going on.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:90%
It's what you just said before.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
You take the masculine,
the solar, so forth,

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.760 align:middle line:90%
and the creator.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you take the woman,
the negative, the lunar.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And this has to be
explained more deeply,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
because oftentimes people
take that to demonize women

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:84%
in general, not understanding
that your body, my body,

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:84%
are beings, are collectives of
masculine-feminine principles

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and energy combined that
reflect a little more of one

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:90%
than the other.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: They do.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
that when you find

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:84%
a very advanced spiritual
human in private quarters,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:84%
in substantial
profound communication,

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
in conversation, and
sexuality, and artistry--

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:84%
you find a sort of androgyny
within that person.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Where there's this
perfect balance

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
of masculine and
feminine, like you say.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not gender-based
necessarily.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the flow of it through the
male form and the female form.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:90%
But there is always this--

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:84%
again, this
equilibrium teaching.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So in my work the
path that I teach

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:90%
are called the supernal path--

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.510 align:middle line:84%
S-U-P-E-R-N-A-L. Supernal,
just a celestial from above,

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:90%
something to aspire to.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
In the supernal
path, what we teach

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:84%
is that knowing
the masculine you

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:90%
must know the feminine fully.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And so if there's not a
special woman in my life

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
or as many special
women with whom

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I have wonderful intimacy, and
contacts, and conversation,

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality-- expressed
in different ways, of course.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But when that's there they
show me my blind spots.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.420 align:middle line:84%
A man cannot see
them on his own.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, a woman cannot see
hers without that masculine

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
gender-based.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So you might get a
very masculine woman

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and a very feminine woman
and that can work fine.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Same with guys.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:90%
But it's usually gender-based.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And so when those things
come into one's life,

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing that you get
this incredible opportunity

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:45.010 align:middle line:84%
to explore the
polarization of fortitude

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and yielding, of the
push and of the pull.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.529 align:middle line:90%
Which is positive and negative.

00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We best learn
through contrast period.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: You do.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And just like we
say on your battery,

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.585 align:middle line:84%
the negative isn't
bad on the battery,

00:19:58.585 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and the positive doesn't
function without it.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So you get used to remapping
and recalibrating those things.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.880 align:middle line:84%
What the system does with
polarization in the field

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
that you and I work in and
many of the viewers, of course,

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
are very focused on these
subjects in the quote, "new age

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:90%
and conspiracy fields."

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Same thing is happening.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.030 align:middle line:84%
All they need to do
is seed a few voices

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:84%
of extreme ignorant
polarization, one way

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.040 align:middle line:90%
or the other.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And people are drawn
into this, as you

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:84%
used the word, infantile,
this neoteny, which

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:84%
is this kind of constant
state of preserving

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
juvenile qualities
within oneself.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Just recently I was in--

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I won't tell you
where I was, but I

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:84%
was in a great spiritual mecca
in the West coast of America.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was horrifying really
to see that from the time

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:84%
I was 18, it's the same
garbage, the same rubbish that

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:90%
was there.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And going into some of
the stores and shops

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and touching on there just
some groups that were me

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and I was there just for
totally different purposes,

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.220 align:middle line:84%
but I moved around
those circles and could

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:84%
see this neoteny, this
infantilism, this retardation,

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:84%
which is purposefully
kept that way.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And how they do it
is very, very simple.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
They keep everyone
gravitating to the positive

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and without any
business of shadow.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:90%
And when that happens, you lose.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're living positive,
positive, positive, you lose.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:90%
You're out of the game.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's the clever
thing, because most people

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
who go into spiritual work all
they want to do is feel OK.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to be OK.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:84%
There's no aspirational
true substance whatsoever.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what the groups that
you and I have had contact

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:84%
with-- what they do is say,
that's not good enough.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Unless you aspire to
be something more than

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.480 align:middle line:84%
you are, to become
a person of worth,

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:90%
which you begin not having.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
You have your inherent
worth as a divine journey,

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:84%
but as a person you
build your worth.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
If you can't build that
worth, we don't believe you.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that's taboo in
modern spiritual mainstream.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And it really forces the
denial of the opposing aspects

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
of one's own self, which
has to put you by nature

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.531 align:middle line:90%
into cognitive dissonance.

00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: It does and
if you don't understand--

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.863 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: If your guru is
telling you you can only feel

00:22:30.863 --> 00:22:34.030 align:middle line:84%
the positive and all this
is welling up in your life,

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:84%
there's no mechanism
to even deal with it.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:36.748 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: There isn't.

00:22:36.748 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And without shadow,
there is no whole.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Without the negative,
without the destruction,

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.364 align:middle line:90%
there is no new birth.

00:22:43.364 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you've got
to burn a forest down.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you've got to knock a
house down to build a new one.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you need to destroy
the old man who is rotten

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:90%
and create the new one.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.130 align:middle line:84%
The spark inside what I call the
pristine self, is always pure,

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.350 align:middle line:90%
is always untainted.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not sullied by the
cuts and bruises of life.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:90%
That will go forward always.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But the socialized
self will always

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:84%
try and cling, because
it's been programmed

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.510 align:middle line:90%
by culture to the positive.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And at that positive
spectrum, you can't really

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:90%
go very far without the shadow.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So the shadow enables
you to map the extremes.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Once you've found
the extremes, only

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
at that point can you
determine equilibrium.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And from there you
can freely move

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.480 align:middle line:84%
into great elation,
great serenity,

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.341 align:middle line:84%
or great subversion,
great sexy darkness,

00:23:35.341 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:90%
great whatever you want.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.281 align:middle line:90%
To destroy something holy.

00:23:38.281 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the path.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:40.740 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
It's happening every millisecond
of the day in our own bodies.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.065 align:middle line:90%
The anabolic--

00:23:44.065 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Look around.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and catabolic
functions of our cellular

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:90%
growth.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.355 align:middle line:84%
Without destruction, you
can't make way for the--

00:23:50.355 --> 00:23:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: The microlevel
of our body-- absolutely.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
If cells don't die,
you've got a problem.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.627 align:middle line:84%
If cells aren't
flushed and destroyed,

00:23:56.627 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
you've got a problem, because
new ones can't be created.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this has to
be extended into society.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: At the macro--

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.350 align:middle line:84%
the macro projection of
that is absolutely the same

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.150 align:middle line:90%
as the body.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:90%
It's cellular.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.700 align:middle line:84%
If you can't
destroy; if you can't

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:84%
know what it is to have
this negative force in life

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:90%
become your ally, then you lose.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And Empire has another
robot at its disposal.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's very simple.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I would say this about this
force of Empire, which is just

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:30.850 align:middle line:84%
a containment force to keep
people feeling as subjects,

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.670 align:middle line:84%
like British subjects
under the monarchy.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you're not
going to destroy anything

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:84%
if the poles have
been collapsed.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: No.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Interesting point.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So I would say it like this,
what Empire is here to do,

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:84%
it's not hopeless;
it's not evil.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:84%
What Empire-- a
super zoomed-out,

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:84%
now macro metaphysical
level, what Empire does

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:90%
is provoke us to self-authority.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And if we can have
authority over ourselves,

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:84%
total sovereignty, then
Empire comes and says,

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll take your
control, and we'll

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.450 align:middle line:84%
have this lady here in the
blue corner and this man

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.940 align:middle line:84%
here in the right corner,
and they'll run it.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when we were
doing prep for this interview,

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:84%
you talked about the
"town" that has everything.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this
is intriguing.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Tell us the story.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: So I live in
Washington state up in the far

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Northwest of America, which is
a fabulous place, really good.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's a town near where
I live, a smallish town--

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:90%
10,000 people.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's got a beautiful aspect.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.870 align:middle line:84%
It's got lovely
Victorian buildings.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.670 align:middle line:90%
It's just got the right balance.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Just enough people,
not too many.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And the land makes it difficult
to do too much building,

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't
constantly sprawl out.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:90%
So they've got a lovely place.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:84%
The food-- they have this
great awareness of food.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Farm-to-table, wild
food, organic, grass-fed,

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.040 align:middle line:90%
pasture raised.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:90%
They've got everything right.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And I can go and visit
the bloody chickens

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.637 align:middle line:84%
that lay my eggs, and
the lambs that go in my--

00:26:00.637 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You know their names.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.445 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: --that
go in my belly,

00:26:03.445 --> 00:26:04.660 align:middle line:90%
like that Portlandia sketch.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So you can go to crazy
lengths and see it,

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and see these beautiful
crops coming out

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:90%
the fresh god's earth.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.702 align:middle line:90%
They've got the crime low--

00:26:14.702 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:90%
there's not really any crime.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:16.909 align:middle line:90%
The community is strong.

00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.320 align:middle line:84%
The power-- they
gradually shift in away

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
from these stupid
utility companies

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and generate their own
through hydro, through wind,

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:90%
through solar.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:84%
With school, they're inching
away from mainstream education.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:90%
which is stupid obviously.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it's mainstream.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
To more individual stuff, like
independent charter schools,

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:84%
home schools, quality
Waldorf schools.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
A better way of educating
a child in a more whole way

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to create full boys and girls
with strength and dignity.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:90%
So this is great.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:53.614 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic.

00:26:53.614 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So many other qualities I
could list, but believe me

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.010 align:middle line:90%
it's great.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Except one thing.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:04.510 align:middle line:84%
They don't have their
own spiritual philosophy.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't have their
own political philosophy

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:84%
of who they are
and where they are.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
get there, there

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:17.640 align:middle line:84%
is an immediate
gravitation to the left.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So immediately
the whole town has

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:84%
got the stickers
of all the faces

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:84%
who are on the left,
all the progressives.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:90%
And all the men and women--

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to name them
necessarily-- who you know--

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:84%
feel the Bern, all
that kind of stuff--

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:84%
all these different logos
and symbols, all the blue,

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:90%
all the faces, all the names.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:90%
And they lose.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:90%
They have lost.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.055 align:middle line:90%
They bought and sold already.

00:27:44.055 --> 00:27:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But tell us how that
shows itself in their reality.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: In the reality
it means that their personal

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:84%
understanding of reality
is being instructed to them

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.040 align:middle line:90%
by this think-tank.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.770 align:middle line:84%
You say, OK, you're a
progressive liberal now,

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
because you've chosen
these wise ways of living.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:84%
That means this is
your philosophy for how

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.750 align:middle line:90%
you educate your children.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:84%
This is your philosophy
for what's important.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
This is what you think
about different ethnicities.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:84%
This is what you
think about travel.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.280 align:middle line:84%
When you see a homeless person,
this is what you should now do.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:84%
These are the clothes
you should wear.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:90%
This is the music you listen to.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the way you
give to charity.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:90%
This is what--

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're saying
it's just another program.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: It's a
deep program to say--

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It can
look beautiful,

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.438 align:middle line:84%
it can be beneficial,
but it's another program.

00:28:34.438 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: This is your
behavioral pattern now.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:90%
This is what you do.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Now if you take those
people aside and say,

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
hey, you know there's
another way of doing this.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Forget all those people,
because there's no wisdom,

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.350 align:middle line:84%
there's no elderhood,
there's no integrity there.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:84%
The other guys-- forget
them, same thing.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter who it is.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Forget the names.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's create our own philosophy.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's create our
own leadership here.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be some
political elements

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.470 align:middle line:84%
to that in how we
determine those things

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and how we show our democratic
principles with a small d.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But let us decide that
with no absolute conviction

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:84%
from outside, no
consent from outside.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't need anybody's
permission to do this.

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Let us form our own
leadership completely

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:90%
separate from Empire.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.752 align:middle line:84%
In some small towns that
I've seen, they've done that.

00:29:30.752 --> 00:29:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you drive
around you don't

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.600 align:middle line:84%
see the blue and the red
stickers on people's cars.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very obvious.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.150 align:middle line:90%
You don't see that.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And you don't see them all
with the same approach to this

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.570 align:middle line:84%
is what I do with charity,
this is what I do with war,

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:84%
this is what I do
with homeless people,

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.800 align:middle line:84%
this is what I do with
Black Lives Matter.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's doing any of that.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's doing any of that.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:90%
It's automatically more human.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.930 align:middle line:90%
There's no division at all.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:84%
They're finding
equilibrium by developing

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:84%
their own spiritual
community philosophy.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Without that, you lose again.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
let's talk about that.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:10.142 align:middle line:84%
Let's say these are relatively
new practices over the last 30

00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:11.600 align:middle line:84%
years, I would say,
that have grown

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.480 align:middle line:84%
this town into this holistic
little town in terms

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:90%
of its practices and offerings.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's extend it out in time.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Now that they have adopted the
face of being a blue community,

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and what the
potential corruption

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:84%
is to continue on that path now
blindly devoted to an agenda.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to what
grew it initially,

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.274 align:middle line:84%
which were probably
a few hippies

00:30:35.274 --> 00:30:36.430 align:middle line:90%
and a few farms and such.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: It's again it's this
key cultural gravitation that

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.540 align:middle line:84%
has been alive in Europe
and America, in particular,

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:90%
as the two places I know best.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.990 align:middle line:84%
This key educational
cattle grid gate

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that says, if you think these
things, this is what you are.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:10%
And that was educated
from elementary school

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.870 align:middle line:10%
through high school, college,
university, the workplace,

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:10%
the newspapers, everything.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.890 align:middle line:84%
They've been completely
indoctrinated to say,

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:84%
there is a group
bigger than you who

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:90%
take care of all these issues.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've got all the
things lined up culturally

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and every aspect of life, food,
health, war, social constructs,

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.490 align:middle line:84%
medicine, health care, what
we do about young women who

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.280 align:middle line:84%
have babies, what we do about
men who want to go to war--

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.500 align:middle line:84%
how we feel about that,
that's all been decided.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So just
plug into the socket.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.801 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: It's all done.

00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Here's the menu.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:90%
You can choose 1, 2, or 3.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Which is it?

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Which is it?

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Which is it?

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And from the point where
they leave elementary school,

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:90%
they've already chosen.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.210 align:middle line:90%
That's my proposal to you.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:45.950 align:middle line:84%
They've already
chosen by the time

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:84%
they leave elementary school
at like what is that--

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.510 align:middle line:84%
10, 11, 12, 13,
something like that.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.620 align:middle line:90%
They've chosen.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.860 align:middle line:84%
In England, it's like 11,
12, something like that--

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:90%
primary school we call it.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.275 align:middle line:90%
That first bit of school--

00:31:58.275 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
11 here as well--

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:00.652 align:middle line:90%
roughly 11.

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: So at that time,
it's gone, it's finished.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.900 align:middle line:84%
So 7 to 14, in the middle
of that point, you're done.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So you have to get to
the children and say,

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:84%
there is no one who's
got it pinned down.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.240 align:middle line:84%
There are some
wise elders, there

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.510 align:middle line:84%
are some amazing men and
some incredible women

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:22.790 align:middle line:84%
who can tutor us in independent
spiritual philosophy of how

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:84%
we live, how we look after
our resources in this place,

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:28.820 align:middle line:84%
how we communicate
with each other.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Who can come, who is welcome,
and what sort of people

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.430 align:middle line:84%
are not welcome,
because they come here

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:38.150 align:middle line:84%
with a wrong
heartedness and a desire

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:42.020 align:middle line:90%
to bring nothing to the table.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So even that in itself
puts forward this idea

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.390 align:middle line:84%
that those who contribute are
rewarded for the contribution.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And the greater
the contribution,

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.600 align:middle line:90%
the greater the reward.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And the rewards are not
monetary, they're communal.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:84%
They're the resources
of the community,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.650 align:middle line:84%
the respect of the
community, the choice

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.510 align:middle line:90%
to shape that community.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So from what I've seen when you
get to children 7, 8, and 9,

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:11.589 align:middle line:84%
then those kids grow up to say,
don't tell me what to think,

00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:13.505 align:middle line:84%
don't tell me I'm a
liberal or a conservative.

00:33:13.505 --> 00:33:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: That's garbage.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Never ever call yourself a
liberal or a conservative.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:84%
We all have liberal
components to us.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I am a very liberal
man, with a small l.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm also very conservative,
with a small c.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Of course, who isn't?

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.630 align:middle line:84%
But those polarizations
are just control mechanisms

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:33.810 align:middle line:90%
for the unwary.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you send your kids
to mainstream schools,

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:39.607 align:middle line:90%
they will polarize.

00:33:39.607 --> 00:33:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And it will shift one way or the
other, from decade to decade,

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.690 align:middle line:90%
century to century.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Depending on
the prevailing beliefs

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.200 align:middle line:90%
of your culture and community.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.449 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: And it's all wrong.

00:33:46.449 --> 00:33:47.360 align:middle line:90%
It's all garbage.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So you immediately have
to say, when you polarize,

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:90%
you're out of the game.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.620 align:middle line:90%
An Empire has you.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:54.530 align:middle line:90%
It has this robot.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It will just then go forward
and say, here's the menu.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I've chosen from
the menu, have you?

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Do you like good things?

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.842 align:middle line:90%
Then you must choose this.

00:34:02.842 --> 00:34:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Do you like bad things?

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Then you must be one of those.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
My partner Zeus
and I talk about--

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.270 align:middle line:84%
he's a philosopher as well,
so we speak quite a bit

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:14.690 align:middle line:84%
about these things-- and we've
reduced something recently,

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.300 align:middle line:84%
if reduction is a
good thing at all,

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.760 align:middle line:90%
to something really simple.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's facing us in a
very big way right now.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:26.389 align:middle line:84%
There are energies,
there are people,

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
there are groups of people that
are essentially either giving

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.199 align:middle line:90%
or taking from the matrix.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Agreed.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Agreed.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Nice distillation.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when you
look at it that way,

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.889 align:middle line:84%
we've started distilling right
down-- on a personal level--

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to our own traits, then to
our relationships with others.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And really looking
at am I taking or am

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I giving in this situation?

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.139 align:middle line:90%
What's my own role?

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And then relationships
where we've

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.659 align:middle line:84%
come to accept things as
symbiotic, such as, well you

00:34:57.659 --> 00:34:59.450 align:middle line:84%
always have someone
who gives a little more

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and the other who takes a
little more, and that's cool.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:02.570 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
not cool anymore.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.832 align:middle line:84%
The taking is how we got
in this horrid situation--

00:35:06.832 --> 00:35:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Equilibrium.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --we're in.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:09.388 align:middle line:90%
There's no equilibrium.

00:35:09.388 --> 00:35:11.620 align:middle line:90%
The takers are dominating now.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to go into that on
a micro and a macro level,

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.970 align:middle line:84%
because that will get us
into the world at large

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and the politics
we're living within.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Sure.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:21.520 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very simple for me.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in a way by two
parents who had a lot of love

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of natural wisdom to
say you ain't owed anything.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:33.470 align:middle line:84%
There's no such
thing as privilege.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.750 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
look after you.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.970 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as free health care,

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:84%
or free support,
or free services,

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.250 align:middle line:90%
or this and that and the other.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.950 align:middle line:90%
It's totally flat.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Everyone starts
from exactly where

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.840 align:middle line:84%
they're meant to start
based on all kinds

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.610 align:middle line:84%
of long-term
spiritual timelines.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: And you started here.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And one day you
might understand why

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.770 align:middle line:90%
you started there on this line.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Not here, not here
either, but here.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Why did you start there?

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.440 align:middle line:90%
That's decades of discovery.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.480 align:middle line:90%
But you're here.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.796 align:middle line:84%
You have to make
everything for yourself.

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:06.170 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
look after you.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.975 align:middle line:84%
If you fall over,
you better get up.

00:36:07.975 --> 00:36:09.770 align:middle line:84%
You better dust yourself
down and get up.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.710 align:middle line:84%
If you want a million
dollars, go ahead, go make it.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.540 align:middle line:84%
If you want a wife
and 12 kids, go ahead.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Feel free.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:15.890 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything is under
your own hand,

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.890 align:middle line:90%
everything is for yourself.

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to contribute to
the world for the world

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:24.320 align:middle line:90%
to become your ally.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- I knew
that when I was 10.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was a great
head start or whatever

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.680 align:middle line:90%
that my mom and dad gave me.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:84%
At that point forward,
all I've ever seen

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.580 align:middle line:84%
is a deepening of
that principle.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So in my community that I
live in, if I was running it,

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:42.030 align:middle line:84%
only people who contributed
would be welcome.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: And anyone who wasn't
bringing their own resources,

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.290 align:middle line:84%
whether it's emotional,
physical, craftsmanship,

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:55.400 align:middle line:84%
artistry, financial,
whether they're carpenters,

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.362 align:middle line:90%
or plumbers, or bankers--

00:36:57.362 --> 00:36:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It makes
a rich society.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.736 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: --whatever.

00:36:59.736 --> 00:37:01.760 align:middle line:84%
All the different things
you have to bring.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has tons of skills.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the top three
skills of every person,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:84%
how are you going to make
our community better?

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.182 align:middle line:90%
Because if you can't, get out.

00:37:11.182 --> 00:37:12.390 align:middle line:90%
And I don't care what you do.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're
on the same page.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.310 align:middle line:84%
That is the agenda of
the giving society.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: That's the agenda.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Contribute or get out.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Go hard or go home.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.760 align:middle line:90%
So that's what you do.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you end up on the street
dying in the gutter, too bad.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, too bad.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And conversely,
if you're a person who says,

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.936 align:middle line:84%
I want to make a million dollars
and you can do it without

00:37:28.936 --> 00:37:31.655 align:middle line:84%
standing on the backs and faces
of others, by contributing--

00:37:31.655 --> 00:37:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Great.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --something of value.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.360 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
wrong with money.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Go for it.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Go for it.

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: There's only so
much you can sit in a house,

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.490 align:middle line:90%
and a car, and a yacht anyway.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: And at some point,
you come back to substance.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So all the wealthy people
that I think you and I

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.570 align:middle line:90%
have crossed paths with--

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.740 align:middle line:84%
uber-wealthy-- I think
in conversations past,

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:51.540 align:middle line:90%
we've laughed how--

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.665 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's almost
always a taking environment.

00:37:53.665 --> 00:37:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: --they all go back
to like nothing means anything.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I've got all this stuff
and I have no substance.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.050 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking for substance.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you can help me.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, wow,
with all that resource,

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:07.250 align:middle line:84%
you haven't found a pathway
to your own sovereignty.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the underpinning of
what this is all about--

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.080 align:middle line:84%
so wealth doesn't
really come into it

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.635 align:middle line:84%
as the American
dream in that sense.

00:38:13.635 --> 00:38:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, not so much.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.730 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
I've known a few people

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.680 align:middle line:84%
who were
extraordinarily wealthy,

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.630 align:middle line:90%
who actually were givers.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Everyone around them.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: It's rare
though, isn't it?

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very rare.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But everyone in
their life would say,

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.260 align:middle line:84%
they felt like the sun was
shining on them when they were

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of this person.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Yeah, well,
that's a beautiful thing.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.055 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so they were able
to manage wealth in a way that

00:38:32.055 --> 00:38:34.310 align:middle line:90%
was actually useful for others.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.360 align:middle line:84%
There's only so much you
can use for yourself.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So if it's not extended out,
it doesn't have a lot of value.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.750 align:middle line:84%
If it's just garnered
for your own interest,

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.720 align:middle line:84%
then it's that empty journey
you're talking about.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But I bring this up,
because we want to polarize.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And wealth is certainly in
our community often demonized.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Yeah.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Which is stupid.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Wealth is just merely
what resources do

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:90%
you want to generate for what?

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: For what purpose?

00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Fantastic,
juicy experiment.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.611 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: And if you want
something that is vast

00:39:02.611 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:90%
and succulent, go for it.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.810 align:middle line:84%
You might need $100,
$200, $300 million.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just
in your workshop

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.135 align:middle line:84%
just making some
beautiful thing,

00:39:11.135 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:90%
you don't need any of that.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.830 align:middle line:90%
That's fine as well.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So wealth is like absolutely
nothing to do with it.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.982 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And also
looking at the other side,

00:39:19.982 --> 00:39:22.190 align:middle line:84%
people have taken it to the
extreme when they're very

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.500 align:middle line:84%
frustrated about their
own abilities to manifest

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.260 align:middle line:84%
in the world and their place in
the world, to idolize poverty.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And often times there's
no dignity in poverty,

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:33.200 align:middle line:84%
because all your options
are stripped away.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.960 align:middle line:84%
When you don't have food
to eat or a place to live,

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.580 align:middle line:84%
that's very devastating on
a soul level to a person.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Yeah.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Again, a very unforgiving
view in my supernal pathway

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:46.430 align:middle line:84%
to that, which is I get
it and it's not funny.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've brushed with
it once or twice.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But it always shows
one thing, which

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:52.167 align:middle line:90%
is you're out of alignment.

00:39:52.167 --> 00:39:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's the
poverty in spirit.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: It's a misalignment
with what you're doing and what

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:58.099 align:middle line:90%
you should be doing.

00:39:58.099 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:84%
What you're capable of
doing and what you believe

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.470 align:middle line:90%
you're capable of doing.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Where there's a disconnect
that poverty is there

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:08.270 align:middle line:84%
to show you the uncertainty
and the trepidation

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.810 align:middle line:84%
in that terrible fear
that some people have,

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:15.122 align:middle line:84%
which is am I going to end
up with nothing on the street

00:40:15.122 --> 00:40:16.330 align:middle line:90%
with a little cardboard sign?

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.955 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or am I going to end
up that jerk in the mansion who

00:40:18.955 --> 00:40:19.790 align:middle line:90%
cares about no one?

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Or am I going to be
a lonely person in a big empty

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:90%
house?

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Right.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So both of those things come
from the same place, which is

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.970 align:middle line:90%
as you say a poverty of spirit.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:32.180 align:middle line:84%
But I know lots of good
people who were in poverty.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And it would be tough for me
to say that their problem is

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.160 align:middle line:90%
poverty of spirit.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Their challenge is misalignment.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.942 align:middle line:84%
What they're doing,
they think they

00:40:42.942 --> 00:40:44.650 align:middle line:84%
should be doing,
because that's what they

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.210 align:middle line:90%
have to do to make it happen.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe that
they can do something

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.730 align:middle line:84%
that they enjoy that
is a contribution

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and that the world will ally
with them to support them

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.420 align:middle line:90%
in that endeavor.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.605 align:middle line:90%
They don't believe it.

00:40:56.605 --> 00:40:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's a kind
of fatalism in that case,

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.930 align:middle line:84%
that they won't be supported
in their best efforts.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:02.846 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: There's just
this voice-- exactly--

00:41:02.846 --> 00:41:05.500 align:middle line:84%
there's just this voice saying,
that's for other people.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.910 align:middle line:90%
This guy, well, he's got this.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:07.710 align:middle line:90%
You haven't.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.360 align:middle line:84%
This woman, she's got these
things, but you haven't.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.210 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to have to
do this little job that you

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:16.510 align:middle line:84%
don't like, it sucks, but you
can pay the rent just about.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And maybe one day, you'll win.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:20.620 align:middle line:84%
You'll scratch a card
in the gas station

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.165 align:middle line:90%
and win a million dollars.

00:41:22.165 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:90%
But probably not.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So that is put into people
through mainstream culture.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was going to say
both these points of views have

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:33.880 align:middle line:84%
been programmed into
us with intention.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Yeah.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you always look
at-- it's really simple--

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:40.295 align:middle line:84%
always look at the great
leadership of the world

00:41:40.295 --> 00:41:41.095 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:41:41.095 --> 00:41:44.275 align:middle line:84%
I use great just in
the terms of big.

00:41:44.275 --> 00:41:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Are those people full
of integrity and wisdom?

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And go to any G20, G7,
G8, whatever the heck--

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:84%
go to any of those
giant summits,

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:56.770 align:middle line:84%
look at all the world leaders
when they sat on them tables--

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:59.125 align:middle line:84%
are they full of
wisdom and integrity?

00:41:59.125 --> 00:42:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I don't think
we have to go there.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: It's a
simple one, isn't it?

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.110 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's simple.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: The answer
is no, they're not.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of course, not.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: And when you
go to the giant technology

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:07.567 align:middle line:90%
companies--

00:42:07.567 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and again, we don't need to list
them, you know what they are.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.670 align:middle line:84%
The big ones and
the upcoming ones.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:84%
All different things to do
with technology, transport,

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.540 align:middle line:84%
internet, searching,
gizmos, devices.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.180 align:middle line:84%
The people who are at the
head of those organizations--

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:25.200 align:middle line:84%
not just the guy who founded
it, but the people who run it,

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.280 align:middle line:84%
the people who
determine policy--

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.250 align:middle line:84%
are they full of
wisdom and integrity?

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Do they embody and exude that?

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:33.070 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.470 align:middle line:90%
In almost no cases--

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I've seen one or two
out of thousands-- no.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So again, what Empire
does is it just

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:45.130 align:middle line:84%
allows those people to be
the beacons of success.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:48.670 align:middle line:84%
To say these are the
powerful people, the actors,

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:52.600 align:middle line:84%
the politicians, the
giant business tycoons.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.980 align:middle line:90%
This is success.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.420 align:middle line:90%
This is the positive.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So they're giving
you a false pole,

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.830 align:middle line:84%
so there's no way you
can find equilibrium

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:84%
when you're actually not even
looking at the real thing.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So that what they put
forward is obvious garbage.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And if we just say
it in those terms--

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:08.120 align:middle line:90%
is there wisdom?

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Is there integrity?

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Is there this great embodiment
of knowledge hard-earned

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.350 align:middle line:90%
over life?

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Is there this unshakable
implacable decency

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.480 align:middle line:90%
in this woman, in this man?

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.832 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is always no.

00:43:23.832 --> 00:43:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: These are people
who have by one way or another,

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:28.690 align:middle line:84%
through circumstance,
privilege, or whatnot,

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:31.120 align:middle line:84%
generally either manipulated
or bullied their ways

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.810 align:middle line:90%
into positions of power.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not done through--
the gain isn't

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.790 align:middle line:84%
through anything
that has any merit

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:39.065 align:middle line:90%
or value on a hedonistic level.

00:43:39.065 --> 00:43:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: And nowadays you
can get the paper as it were

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:46.930 align:middle line:84%
to pretty much evidence that
many prominent politicians

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:48.430 align:middle line:90%
murdered their way to success.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:50.242 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:43:50.242 --> 00:43:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: I don't think
that's even disputed amongst

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:52.815 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:43:52.815 --> 00:43:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: You just
don't talk about it.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a huge problem.

00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So it takes us to
a point, if I may,

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:04.180 align:middle line:84%
where there's this
illusion that politics

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.140 align:middle line:84%
is these are the people
who care most about society

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and want to make a difference.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.720 align:middle line:84%
The President of
the United States

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.010 align:middle line:84%
is the most powerful
role in the world.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:16.060 align:middle line:84%
The UK prime minister,
the chancellors,

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and the queens and kings.

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:21.540 align:middle line:84%
These are the people who
care most about society

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and who are really working with
very difficult circumstances

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.480 align:middle line:84%
trying to make
life better, trying

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:90%
to do the best for people.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:29.870 align:middle line:90%
Voted from grassroots levels--

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.664 align:middle line:90%
the president, prime ministers.

00:44:31.664 --> 00:44:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What planet
are you on again?

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.996 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Voted from
grassroots levels.

00:44:34.996 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying
to do their best.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.910 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes they get it right.

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they make mistakes.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And if it's way off target,
you vote the other side in.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:47.200 align:middle line:84%
All of that is
absolute claptrap.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It's hogwash.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a disgrace to human kind.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So when you see the current
president of the United States

00:44:53.920 --> 00:45:00.520 align:middle line:84%
come in, one giant purpose
that he serves is he makes,

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.590 align:middle line:84%
through his own
strange behavior--

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:03.970 align:middle line:90%
which we'll come to--

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.070 align:middle line:90%
a mockery of the whole thing.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.776 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have a word for
that in the Lakota language

00:45:10.776 --> 00:45:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and let's speak about that.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Sure.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So the Indians as
they're called again now,

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans, the indigenous
people who were in our land

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.670 align:middle line:84%
here for a long time over in
Minnesota, North Dakota, South

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Dakota, Wyoming--

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.620 align:middle line:84%
those beautiful, beautiful
places; free, pure places,

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.690 align:middle line:90%
very much still--

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:35.890 align:middle line:84%
the Lakota people, some of
the Cheyenne people as well--

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:39.730 align:middle line:84%
they have a word heyoka,
H-E-Y-O-K-A. Heyoka--

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.390 align:middle line:84%
a heyoka is a sort of
contrarian warrior.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:48.196 align:middle line:84%
It is a figure ordained,
not from themselves-- it's

00:45:48.196 --> 00:45:49.570 align:middle line:84%
not an office that
you take, it's

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:51.670 align:middle line:90%
not a job that you apply for.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:53.410 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
happens to you.

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:55.080 align:middle line:90%
You're usually ignorant of it.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.660 align:middle line:10%
And the heyoka shows
essentially what

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.540 align:middle line:10%
comes are some traits
of it-- but essentially,

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:10%
that we've made some
giant mistakes in thinking

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.250 align:middle line:10%
about society at large.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And they show that through this
grotesque, ugly, satirization

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.720 align:middle line:90%
of everything that we hold dear.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.780 align:middle line:84%
The dignity of the
President's office.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.620 align:middle line:84%
The purpose and great
statesman-like behavior

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Secretary of
State, of Defense,

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.460 align:middle line:84%
of the schools
and the libraries.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:30.400 align:middle line:90%
They're so precious.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.910 align:middle line:90%
They're so wonderful.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:35.120 align:middle line:84%
They fill our children's minds
with so many wonderful things.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:37.510 align:middle line:84%
That the institutions
that are so precious.

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:41.200 align:middle line:90%
And here along comes this clown.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A disruptor.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.970 align:middle line:10%
>> KRAMER: A disruptor who
says, this is all rubbish

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:47.720 align:middle line:10%
and we're not going
to do this anymore.

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.360 align:middle line:90%
This is all garbage.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And he shakes hands
in the wrong way.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:53.980 align:middle line:90%
He speaks in the wrong way.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.990 align:middle line:90%
He's uncouth in many ways.

00:46:55.990 --> 00:47:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Totally unsuited, totally wrong,
back to front, contrarian.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:06.280 align:middle line:84%
The Cheyennes actually call it
the booger, strangely enough.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.270 align:middle line:90%
And you see it in many places.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But to me it is
very clear as soon

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.900 align:middle line:84%
as I watched the November
elections and the victor

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.340 align:middle line:90%
comes forward--

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.600 align:middle line:84%
our friend in red
with the hair--

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I thought it's a heyoka.

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.540 align:middle line:90%
We've got a heyoka.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.350 align:middle line:84%
The top position in the world
is a contrarian warrior.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Unappointed, ignorant of
his own channel and purpose.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:32.230 align:middle line:84%
What he thinks he's doing
is just something else.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.960 align:middle line:84%
What he's actually
doing is pulling apart

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.650 align:middle line:84%
the tragic, disgusting
misconceptions

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.750 align:middle line:90%
we've had about politics.

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:middle line:84%
One-by-one-by-one already the
media has fallen to pieces,

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.200 align:middle line:90%
because of this man.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Think of it.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Before this, the major
newspapers, the Telegraph,

00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.630 align:middle line:84%
the Observer the New York
Times, the Washington Post--

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.870 align:middle line:84%
all those organizations--
television, BBC,

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:00.830 align:middle line:90%
CNN-- we thought oh, they're OK.

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:03.520 align:middle line:84%
They may have a little
bias this way or that way.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.020 align:middle line:90%
No, they're not OK.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.300 align:middle line:90%
They are very, very wrong.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Very, very, very bad.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And any impartial observer who
looks at that now, you say,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I can't quite believe that these
institutions are that rotten.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Not just they've
become that way,

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:22.690 align:middle line:84%
but I think they
were always that way.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the sovereign
man, the sovereign woman

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:29.510 align:middle line:84%
is like well, no, I don't
have any problem with that.

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:30.790 align:middle line:90%
I knew that.

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Of course I knew that.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But the gentlemen and the
gentle women, they were like,

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.040 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.425 align:middle line:90%
What does that leave us with?

00:48:38.425 --> 00:48:40.450 align:middle line:90%
With no mainstream institutions.

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:41.810 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So they fire this ire, this
dark force towards the heyoka.

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And the heyoka's job is
to receive that hatred,

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to receive their fear,
to receive their disgust

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.440 align:middle line:90%
at their own misconceptions.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And he receives it
and transmutes it,

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.060 align:middle line:90%
because he's totally unaware.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you say he's the
best heyoka you have ever seen.

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: I have never seen
anyone do a more supreme job

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:16.470 align:middle line:84%
than the President of the United
States that we have right now

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.870 align:middle line:90%
in July, 2017.

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:20.100 align:middle line:90%
That is incredible.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.221 align:middle line:90%
It could not be better.

00:49:22.221 --> 00:49:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It couldn't have
been anyone else to perform that

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.520 align:middle line:90%
role.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Any other person who
got in that role conservative,

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Democrat, Independent,
Green, ecologist people,

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:39.310 align:middle line:84%
any other person would have been
a total unchanged continuation

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:40.110 align:middle line:90%
of Empire--

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:41.520 align:middle line:90%
completely unchanged.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:44.910 align:middle line:84%
It would have been a disaster
for this fine republic--

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:46.170 align:middle line:90%
a disaster.

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:49.060 align:middle line:84%
The only chance is
to put a heyoka in.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're playing a completely
different game now.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Where you understand
for the first time,

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.870 align:middle line:84%
the Environmental
Protection Agency

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:middle line:84%
is not there to protect
the environment.

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Schools do not educate children,
they do the opposite of that.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Hospitals do not exist to heal
people and make them better.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:08.330 align:middle line:90%
They're nothing to do with that.

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.360 align:middle line:84%
They're places to manage
sickness for business.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.160 align:middle line:90%
It's clear.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.990 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very clear.

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The Affordable Health
Care system is not there

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:17.270 align:middle line:90%
to give us all health.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:18.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not for that.

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:19.630 align:middle line:90%
It's for something else.

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:22.390 align:middle line:84%
The FBI, MI6-- they're not doing
what they thought they were.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.420 align:middle line:90%
CIA-- it's something else.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.970 align:middle line:90%
It's totally something else.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:30.150 align:middle line:84%
That reversal for me is easy,
because I already knew that.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:32.400 align:middle line:84%
For you it's easy, because
you knew that in your bones

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.420 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.960 align:middle line:90%
So for us, we're like so?

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But there's an
awful lot of people

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:39.510 align:middle line:84%
who were very emotionally
invested, and say,

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:43.010 align:middle line:84%
well, if that's true,
what have we got?

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:45.620 align:middle line:84%
What have we been doing
for the last century?

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:47.640 align:middle line:84%
What have we been doing
for the last millennium?

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, people
experience this very

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:50.813 align:middle line:84%
differently than any
time in the past,

00:50:50.813 --> 00:50:54.030 align:middle line:84%
because it went into an actual
cultural depression among

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.460 align:middle line:84%
a huge percentage
of the population.

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.940 align:middle line:90%
And my sister being one.

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.910 align:middle line:84%
She has this lovely life
that's starting to form

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:02.490 align:middle line:90%
and then the election happens.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And she falls into
this depression

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.570 align:middle line:84%
as though everything was for
naught in her whole life,

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.153 align:middle line:84%
because this happened
in this country.

00:51:08.153 --> 00:51:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Because the
heyoka shows what's true.

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Which is everything
we were told is a lie.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And the people who can't deal
with that, focus it on him.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: And if it was her,
it would have been all right.

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Or this other fellow
would have been all right.

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:21.666 align:middle line:90%
Or this other woman--

00:51:21.666 --> 00:51:23.040 align:middle line:84%
it's not about
the personalities.

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:23.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: It's not about
this woman or this man.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't know who
they are as people.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.341 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: But it's
about the office.

00:51:29.341 --> 00:51:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And the office of the
United States of America,

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:35.280 align:middle line:84%
the President of the
United States of America,

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.910 align:middle line:84%
is now not a president, but
something very different.

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:40.754 align:middle line:90%
This had to come.

00:51:40.754 --> 00:51:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree with you.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.294 align:middle line:84%
The morning after
the election, I

00:51:43.294 --> 00:51:45.390 align:middle line:84%
was kind of-- everyone
was kind of surprised.

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I think there was some surprise
just in the way it turned out.

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But I went into
meditation and I just

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.050 align:middle line:90%
let myself be shown things.

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And it was really simple.

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Barely hit the chair
and closed my eyes,

00:51:55.530 --> 00:52:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and then in this wonderful
scrolly antique font,

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.406 align:middle line:84%
it came up in a very
pleasant way-- the destroyer.

00:52:04.406 --> 00:52:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: So you
say that at the time.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And it's true.

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: And if you forgive--

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:10.006 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I didn't
see it as a bad thing.

00:52:10.006 --> 00:52:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I thought yes, the system has to
now go into severe corrections.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:16.620 align:middle line:10%
>> KRAMER: And if you forgive
the pun here, the "trump"

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:22.420 align:middle line:10%
card of the fool in tarot is
what was my initial thought.

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.900 align:middle line:10%
I thought the heyoka, the fool.

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.610 align:middle line:84%
The fool who is
ignorant, but begins

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.760 align:middle line:84%
a journey that unravels
all the misconceptions.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.136 align:middle line:84%
In themselves, the
fool is the most--

00:52:33.136 --> 00:52:35.430 align:middle line:84%
who wants to see the fool
when you get a tarot card?

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:37.300 align:middle line:10%
If you don't know
what tarot is, you

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.330 align:middle line:10%
are afraid of the fool or death.

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:42.460 align:middle line:10%
When you know what tarot is,
they are fantastic cards.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.945 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: They are fantastic
cards, so when he came in--

00:52:44.945 --> 00:52:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're the ones
that are extreme change.

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: --when he came in,
I thought that means change.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So I pull up on my
website or whatever,

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:56.130 align:middle line:84%
this picture of the
fool card, with not

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:57.150 align:middle line:90%
really any description.

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:58.916 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
people respond and go--

00:52:58.916 --> 00:52:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's it.

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:01.415 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: --I know
what you're saying.

00:53:01.415 --> 00:53:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel that--

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That anger.

00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: --sadness, the
anger, that depression.

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:05.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel despondent.

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I think, of course,
we have to zoom out.

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:10.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to get that
macro view of it.

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We do.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it de-politicizes
everything to understand

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:18.630 align:middle line:84%
culture at large and
institutionalized thinking is

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:19.740 align:middle line:90%
no longer--

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.990 align:middle line:84%
there is no longer a proper
place for it in our world.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: To politicize
is to polarize.

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: And if you're being
polarized by an outside force,

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:28.820 align:middle line:84%
because of what you're
seeing on this newspaper,

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:31.220 align:middle line:84%
or this TV show, or
this alternative site,

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:34.330 align:middle line:84%
or this conspiracy site,
you've been bought and sold.

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So the journey back
to sovereignty, which

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.995 align:middle line:90%
our conversations always go to.

00:53:39.995 --> 00:53:42.820 align:middle line:84%
We only have about five minutes
left, so let's talk about this.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's take that despondency
some people are feeling.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:48.460 align:middle line:84%
This elation and
hope that's dwindling

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.990 align:middle line:84%
among the other part of the
people in the population.

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:54.459 align:middle line:84%
And there will be people who
need to still live there,

00:53:54.459 --> 00:53:55.750 align:middle line:90%
because that's where they live.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But let's take the
people who are starting

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.850 align:middle line:84%
to come unglued,
who we're surrounded

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.600 align:middle line:90%
by in our own personal lives.

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.950 align:middle line:84%
How do you go about even
communicating and speaking

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:08.430 align:middle line:84%
with the beauty of
the way systems find

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:10.267 align:middle line:90%
a way to correct themselves?

00:54:10.267 --> 00:54:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Well, the
real answer is I don't.

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I let them destroy themselves
with their own fear

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and despondency, until
they're in the fetal position

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:21.120 align:middle line:84%
weeping, until there's
no more tears left.

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's say
that's where they are.

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.683 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: When
they're at that point,

00:54:24.683 --> 00:54:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and only when they're at that
point of complete despair,

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.080 align:middle line:84%
they have then mapped
their edge, their shadow.

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Then we can talk.

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:36.560 align:middle line:84%
While they are still campaigning
within this false paradigm,

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.360 align:middle line:90%
there's no point.

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't talk to anybody.

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not because
I feel superior.

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.010 align:middle line:90%


00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to advocate
any sort of elitism

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:48.570 align:middle line:90%
here in this thought.

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I
know when somebody

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:54.790 align:middle line:84%
is laboring under someone else's
conception, they can't see.

00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So the emotional investment
must be withdrawn.

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And the way you do
that is through shadow.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So to remove your
emotional import

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:07.190 align:middle line:90%
you have to meet despair.

00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Total despair, where you're
at the edge, and over the edge

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:11.630 align:middle line:90%
is nothingness.

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: At that
point, now you begin.

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:16.730 align:middle line:90%
You draw the fool card.

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:19.067 align:middle line:84%
Everything you thought
was right was wrong.

00:55:19.067 --> 00:55:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything you thought
was wrong, was right.

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything is upside
down and back to front.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.500 align:middle line:90%
You start from scratch.

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:26.570 align:middle line:90%
Everything is reduced to ashes.

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:30.720 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you then say,
OK, all my foundations are gone.

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.520 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing.

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.436 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure who I am.

00:55:32.436 --> 00:55:33.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what-- good.

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Identity must be the Phoenix.

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:41.280 align:middle line:84%
The first emblem of the United
States seal was not an eagle,

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.460 align:middle line:90%
it was a Phoenix.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And it was reduced to ashes.

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And that Phoenix, what
comes from those ashes is

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.360 align:middle line:90%
made of fire, is made of light.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And that light is
inherently sovereign.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:58.480 align:middle line:84%
That is the thing that emanates
us, that emanates into us.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:03.410 align:middle line:84%
That is automatically free,
automatically has liberty,

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:05.540 align:middle line:90%
automatically self-determining.

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So to dissolve that
despair, you have

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.190 align:middle line:90%
to embrace your own journey.

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Do not affiliate with
Empire menu organizations.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.899 align:middle line:84%
Practically any major organ--
just forget all of that.

00:56:17.899 --> 00:56:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Forget institutions.

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:20.648 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: Forget
the institutions.

00:56:20.648 --> 00:56:22.220 align:middle line:90%
They're not here to help you.

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, who've
really put into that,

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and been out there
on the streets,

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and been flesh and blood
involved, that's a tough one.

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a really tough one.

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.880 align:middle line:84%
But I think when you search
deep inside and you see,

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.230 align:middle line:90%
you realize you've been had.

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's a tough one there
to know you've been conned.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.850 align:middle line:90%
There's been a long con.

00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 50 years.

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 80 years.

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:45.210 align:middle line:90%
A long con in your life.

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:49.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the
humility, the humble truth

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:52.850 align:middle line:84%
within yourself to say, I
may have been conned here.

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's do an experiment.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's start again from scratch
and build new foundations.

00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:58.970 align:middle line:90%
What is medicine?

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:00.500 align:middle line:90%
What is food?

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.000 align:middle line:90%
What is leadership?

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.730 align:middle line:90%
How do we educate each other?

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:06.070 align:middle line:90%
What is this for?

00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:06.870 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Don't allow anyone
else to tell you.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Build those foundations.

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Make sure in your life
you have wise elders.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:18.480 align:middle line:84%
People who have been on the
path for decades, sovereign,

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.530 align:middle line:84%
independent, who you can speak
to, who embody the teaching,

00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:24.177 align:middle line:90%
not just talk about it.

00:57:24.177 --> 00:57:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Like I can just say this and
then go over there and just

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:29.530 align:middle line:90%
be a fool.

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:33.920 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, this woman,
this man, always embody it.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.740 align:middle line:84%
This is a teacher, because they
walk it when no one's looking.

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.169 align:middle line:90%
This is what they do.

00:57:38.169 --> 00:57:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Have those people
in your life and it

00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:41.670 align:middle line:90%
will accelerate that process.

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:44.600 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to take another
50 years to get to truth.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking about is
one's preparedness for honesty.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Which I would say, in my
teaching-- we have many maxims,

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.390 align:middle line:90%
many axioms--

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:57.050 align:middle line:84%
one is how truthful
can you afford to be?

00:57:57.050 --> 00:57:57.994 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:57:57.994 --> 00:57:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And this takes us
right back full circle

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.220 align:middle line:84%
to the beginning of
the conversation,

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.160 align:middle line:84%
because these esoteric
paths of knowledge

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.090 align:middle line:84%
require the same
open-mindedness and humility.

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:10.130 align:middle line:84%
This going in, not
assuming you know anything,

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:11.450 align:middle line:90%
and starting from scratch.

00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:14.289 align:middle line:84%
And letting it be revealed
to you through your own self.

00:58:14.289 --> 00:58:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>> KRAMER: You have to be
prepared to destroy yourself.

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.490 align:middle line:84%
To reduce yourself to
ashes and know that nothing

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:22.400 align:middle line:84%
can be destroyed
in its divine form.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.230 align:middle line:90%
The self disappears.

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Put yourself on the
floor, fetal position,

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.520 align:middle line:90%
work your way back up.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The stronger the
ego position, the harder it is.

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: Sure.

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.413 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that's always
the challenge with humanity.

00:58:35.413 --> 00:58:36.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:38.400 align:middle line:90%
We are just about out of time.

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts?

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.440 align:middle line:90%
That was so beautiful.

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>> KRAMER: No.

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.640 align:middle line:10%
I would just encourage
people that if you ever

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:48.590 align:middle line:10%
feel that there's the system
that is against humankind,

00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:49.622 align:middle line:10%
don't politicize it.

00:58:49.622 --> 00:58:51.080 align:middle line:10%
It's nothing to do
with what we see

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.120 align:middle line:10%
on television and the internet.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.840 align:middle line:84%
If you self-determine in every
area of life-- emotionally,

00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.300 align:middle line:84%
spiritually,
sexually, physically,

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.690 align:middle line:84%
artistically-- when
you self-determine,

00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:04.640 align:middle line:90%
you dissolve the Empire.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So don't ever believe
anything outside of yourself.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Self-determine and
trust the wise elders

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:14.540 align:middle line:84%
who embody in your life
and all will be well.

00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hear, hear.

00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:19.190 align:middle line:84%
On that note, once again, it is
just the greatest joy talking

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:20.540 align:middle line:90%
with you every time, Neil.

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:21.030 align:middle line:90%

00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:22.946 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Until next
time, thank you so much.

00:59:22.946 --> 00:59:23.821 align:middle line:90%

00:59:23.821 --> 00:59:26.070 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: To follow more

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:27.840 align:middle line:10%
