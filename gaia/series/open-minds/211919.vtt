>>REGINA MEREDITH: We're going
to start this story in 1945

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.120 align:middle line:10%
with the discovery of
the Nag Hammadi texts.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Two Egyptian peasant brothers
found the texts outside a cave

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and brought them home, where
mom burned some of them

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:90%
to heat the hut they lived in.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Peter Canova is
here with us today

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the ramifications
of millennia of wisdom going

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:90%
up in smoke and so much more.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.927 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Peter.

00:00:36.927 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PETER CANOVA: Nice to be here.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.302 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of all,
what was the significance

00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:90%
of these scrolls?

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And I love the story that
you relay about the mother

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and what happened with
these scrolls and why.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.592 align:middle line:84%
These things have happened
throughout history.

00:00:49.592 --> 00:00:50.925 align:middle line:90%
And you're thinking, oh, my god.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:51.725 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yeah.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:55.243 align:middle line:84%
It had a lot of Indiana
Jones-type elements to it.

00:00:55.243 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us a
little bit about it.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.368 align:middle line:84%
Because people don't know that
part of the story, normally.

00:00:59.368 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:10%
>>CANOVA: Well, in 1945,
some Egyptian brothers

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:10%
were poking around caves
in the lower mountains

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:10%
outside of a town called
Nag Hammadi in Egypt.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:90%
And they went into the caves.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
earthenware jars in there.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And they debated whether
to break them open,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.360 align:middle line:84%
because they were
afraid there might

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:90%
be an evil jinn in there--

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:90%
genie, as they call it.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:90%
A jinn in Islamic terms.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But their greed overcame their
fear because they said, well,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:90%
then again, it could be gold.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:90%
So they broke it open.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:10%
And all these papyrus
scrolls fall out.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And at first, they said, well,
this has to do with Christians.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:90%
This has nothing to do with us.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's just leave it alone.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.743 align:middle line:84%
But then they said,
well, we don't know.

00:01:41.743 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it might be
worth something.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:90%
So they took them back home.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And yes, as you said, mom, not
realizing the value of these,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:90%
used some of them for burning--

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For fuel.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: --the furnace for fuel
for cooking and so forth and so

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, we lost
some great text there.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
significance of it

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
is that these texts gave us
the insight, a window, back

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:90%
into the old Gnostic masters.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Gnostics, that
comes from a Greek word

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:90%
"gnosis," which means "to know."

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Gnostics were a
group of mystics that were

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:90%
centered in Alexandria, Egypt.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were really, I
guess I could say, probably,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.995 align:middle line:84%
the most scientific
seers of their day,

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:84%
as I think we'll get into
a little bit later on.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But prior to this
time, we had no voice

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.010 align:middle line:84%
of the Gnostic masters, except
through their enemies, which

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:90%
were the early church fathers.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So we really only knew very
much about the Gnostics

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
through the writings
of the church fathers.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, those were,
rather, hostile point of view.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
But now we were able
to hear directly

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:90%
from these old Gnostic masters.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And it opened up a
whole new perspective

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
on early Christianity
and the nature

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:84%
of the mystical
Christian church,

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:84%
the mystical foundations
of the Christian church.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it
accurate that it's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:84%
believed that these
texts were written

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
around the fourth
and fifth century

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:84%
by a sect of Christian monks
who were of a mystical nature?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Probably
not Christian monks.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:84%
It was probably hidden
by Christian monks.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hidden
by Christian monks.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: But the
writings of the Gnostics,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:90%
they vary over time.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Part of the knock that the
Christian church has leveled

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:84%
against the Gnostics
is, well, their texts

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
came after the writings
of Paul and so forth.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not really true
because the Gospel of Thomas,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
which is clearly Gnostic,
seemed to be dated just

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:84%
about the time of the
writings of Paul, about 50

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
AD, and yes, the other writings,
although the ones that we have

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:84%
appear to have been written
around 100 AD or there.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if those were
copies of earlier texts.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, there may be
earlier Gnostic texts out there

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:84%
that were originals
that we're not aware of,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:90%
and we just got copies.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, primarily in the
first century after Christ.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
would seem, then,

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
that because they were talking
about the foundational level

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of reality, that
this must have been inherited

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and passed-down knowledge
from even Atlantean

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
or ancient Egyptian times.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.729 align:middle line:84%
What is your
understanding of that?

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Well,
the Gnostics were

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
very unique because Alexandria
was the intellectual capital

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:84%
of the world at that time,
far more so than Rome

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:90%
or even Athens.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And you had the confluences
of so many ancient traditions.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus, Persian
Zoroastrians,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:84%
the Jewish Kabbalah, Egyptian
Hermeticists, and even

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Hellenistic Greek
philosophy was all part

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
of the intellectual mainstream
of Alexandria at that time.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And the Gnostics really were
the people who synthesized those

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:90%
into a coherent understanding.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:84%
But I would also say this
to be really accurate--

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
there was a universal spiritual
tradition in ancient times.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We call it the Perennial
Philosophy today.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And it had common
elements to it in, really,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:90%
throughout the ancient world.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.433 align:middle line:84%
Of course, over
the centuries, it

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:84%
would have been differentiated
in different cultures

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
But it talked about everything
stemming-- all appearances

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:90%
stemming from one source.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And it described
the nature of light

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and how light
operates and so forth.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And there were actually what
they called the mystery schools

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.833 align:middle line:90%
back in those days.

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can think of
the mystery schools

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:84%
as an Ivy League of mystical
traditional schools that

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.760 align:middle line:84%
stretched all the
way from India, even

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
to the British Isles.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And they all would have
had variances, as I said,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:90%
in their teachings.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
But they trained adepts
in the mystical arts

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and in the methodology
of contacting

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:84%
higher spirit, higher
consciousness, higher

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:90%
sources of information.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So that was the foundation
that the Gnostics built on.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.435 align:middle line:84%
They didn't just
invent all of it.

00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:90%
They inherited much of it.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
But they collated it and put
it into a very coherent system

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:90%
of understanding.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what it would seem.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And talk about up in
smoke, Alexandria.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Yeah, unfortunately,
twice actually, the library

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:90%
burned.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the serapeum, which
was a smaller library, burnt.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And the knowledge that we
lost is just unfathomable.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By design, I
assume, do you think?

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: It's hard to say.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.198 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
it's speculation.

00:06:28.198 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Yeah,
it's hard to say.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can--

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I do think that there's a
principle of opposition that

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:90%
exists in this world.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.632 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: And that great
light attracts great darkness.

00:06:37.632 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And that, perhaps, circumstances
like that are manifestations.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so gone.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:90%
So here we are now.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
It takes a couple
thousand years.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:84%
It'll all come
back around people.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the same players
are back around again.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the creation story.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And let's go into it as
told in the "Pistis Sophia"

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and why is this
particular body of work

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:90%
so important in your mind.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Well, first
of all, it lays out

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:84%
what I believe was the
foundation of quantum physics

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
3,000 years before
quantum physics.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It's so rich in symbolism
and so important

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.570 align:middle line:84%
for understanding the
nature of this world,

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
the origin of human beings,
and how reality operates.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:90%
It encompasses all those things.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's very deep.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And I need to take a
little bit of time.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.497 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm going to ask you--

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to prompt you
through because it is so rich.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:90%
There's so much to it.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So I thought-- I just
took it in the flow

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:90%
that I found interesting.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Sure.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.493 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
we'll go on a journey

00:07:44.493 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
together and interject
anything you want.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Sure.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:84%
What I would tell our
listening audience

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:84%
is, close your eyes
while I'm telling this.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Because it will
help you visualize

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.495 align:middle line:84%
things that are a little
abstract and sometimes

00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:90%
hard to grasp.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you just picture a field
of energy that extends out

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:84%
into infinity, and picture
it as a whitish bubble

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.690 align:middle line:84%
or something with color in
it that extends over a field,

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
it radiates out, this energy
was the mind of the source.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:84%
This was the source
projecting its energy outward.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And within this
vast energy field,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
there are pockets
or compartments.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And those pockets
or compartments

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:84%
are distinct realities,
localized realities

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
of which ours, physical
reality, is one of them.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Sophia story basically
starts off by the one source

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:48.060 align:middle line:84%
projecting its thought out to
form other spiritual entities

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.514 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual beings.

00:08:49.514 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can say,
well, it might be

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
similar to angels in Christian
terminology, but not exactly.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
What these beings were
were archetypal energies

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:90%
of the one source itself.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:90%
They represented aspects.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally, I
call it the source.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.313 align:middle line:90%
But you can call it God.

00:09:09.313 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:90%
You can call it the source--

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The creator.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: --the creator.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.827 align:middle line:84%
You can call it
anything you want.

00:09:12.827 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same thing.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.142 align:middle line:90%
The terminology doesn't matter.

00:09:15.142 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The point is there
was some presence with minds

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:84%
so vast it had the
potential to create.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Exactly.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.445 align:middle line:84%
And it had the desire
to expand itself

00:09:24.445 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
throughout different
experiences of creation.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And that was the whole
purpose of it generating

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:90%
other points of consciousness.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Because think about
it for a second.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.565 align:middle line:84%
If you're everything, it's
a rather static existence.

00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:90%
You can exist.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:90%
But you can't really experience.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
You only experience through
contrasts with other beings,

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.520 align:middle line:90%
with other things.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:84%
That's how you
reflect upon yourself,

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.625 align:middle line:90%
is by the contrast around you.

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you're talking about
these beings, these archetypes

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.122 align:middle line:84%
that were created, the way
you explain it in the book,

00:09:56.122 --> 00:09:57.580 align:middle line:84%
it's almost as
though what we would

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:84%
call the noble
attributes, you could say,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:84%
of compassion,
beauty, truth, grace.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.040 align:middle line:84%
These concepts became
archetypal entities.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:90%
That's about that.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.047 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: That's exactly it.

00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:84%
These spiritual entities,
which were really

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
sources of intelligent
energy in and of themselves,

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:84%
were aspects of the
deity, aspects of God,

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the source.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.700 align:middle line:84%
They were given names like
truth, justice, beauty, wisdom,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:84%
all these beautiful
attributes, which

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:84%
are archetypal images
that even extend down

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:90%
into our level of existence.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
These are archetypes
that have guided humanity

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.015 align:middle line:90%
through art and poetry--

00:10:37.015 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
Noble Truths, yeah.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: --and the Noble
Truths throughout the ages.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So the process by which
these beings were generated

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:84%
is important to understand
because it was actually

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:90%
a process of limitation.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:84%
When I told you that
the source projected out

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
this vast field of energy,
which they call the quantum

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.970 align:middle line:84%
fields in modern
terminology, there

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.190 align:middle line:84%
are parallel dimensions
or parallel universes

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.990 align:middle line:90%
within that field.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:84%
As I told you, there's
compartments within that field.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, those compartments
are not really spatial.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
People like to think
in terms of space.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.765 align:middle line:84%
But what they really were were
frequencies of vibrations.

00:11:15.765 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Frequencies, yes.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Differing frequencies
created different dimensions

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.290 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.708 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like the
multiverse is--

00:11:21.708 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: The multiverse.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the collection
of these frequencies.

00:11:23.815 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Exactly.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.875 align:middle line:84%
And these spiritual beings,
which were called aeons,

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
A-E-O-N-S, which means
eternities in Greek,

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and they represented the forces
that helped shape the creation

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:84%
in the way that the
creator wanted to do it.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
They were working in harmony or
with the will of the creator.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
But they had a sense
of self-identity.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.430 align:middle line:84%
They realized they
were themselves.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
But they realized they
were part of the source.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let me
just say something.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.850 align:middle line:84%
At this point, this was
almost pure thought-form--

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yes.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --existence?

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.095 align:middle line:84%
There was no material
reality at this time.

00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we're
going to go in a little bit.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: That's correct.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, we have these archetypes.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And as in all things,
learning through contrast,

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
then did this creative force
create their mirror reflection

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.840 align:middle line:90%
in the negative?

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Well, that-- you
have to go a little bit further

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:84%
into the story to get
to that part of it.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.545 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about Sophia.

00:12:27.545 --> 00:12:28.345 align:middle line:90%
And here--

00:12:28.345 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're going
to spend a lot of time on her.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yeah.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And here's where Sophia
comes into the story.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I call her God's girl.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: The youngest of
these aeons that were created

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.360 align:middle line:84%
was Sophia, whose
name means wisdom.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.492 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally, the
only reason most people

00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:84%
aren't familiar with
Sophia-- because she

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.540 align:middle line:84%
is a character in the
Bible, particularly

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:90%
in the Old Testament.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:90%
But she's called wisdom, and--

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:90%
instead of Sophia.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Sophia is the Greek
word for wisdom.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:84%
The English translations that
we got use the term wisdom.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And she is a very prominent
figure in the Book of Job.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And in Proverbs, she says, "I
was there from the beginning.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
I was there with the creator
at the beginning," meaning

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:90%
she was one of the eternities.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So each of these
eternities had--

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:84%
it was a little bit of
a hierarchy in a sense.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we talked
about limitation.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And the way you
experience individuality

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:90%
is through limitation.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:27.790 align:middle line:84%
What made any of these aeons or
spiritual beings differentiated

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.150 align:middle line:84%
from one another was their
level of spiritual vibration.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:90%
So it worked its way on down.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.745 align:middle line:84%
So the closer you
were to the source,

00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:90%
the higher the vibration was.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:90%
The more--

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So truth and beauty
were above, it turns out,

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:90%
wisdom?

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yes.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you worked
your way down,

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:84%
there was a little
bit of dilution.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, still very high spiritual
being, very godlike high

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:84%
spiritual beings, but there
was a differentiation in terms

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:90%
of the spiritual vibration.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:84%
What I liken it to
is you have a CD.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you make a copy of
that CD and a copy of that copy

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:90%
and a copy of that copy.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, the original has the
greatest clarity and fidelity.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The subsequent copies are
all a little bit diluted.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:84%
They're very close,
very similar,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.150 align:middle line:84%
but they're a
little bit diluted.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So Sophia was the last of these
aeons or these spiritual beings

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:90%
to be created.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:90%
And she was wisdom.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:90%
So how does wisdom grow?

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, it only grows
through experience.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So Sophia had this desire
to create on her own,

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.540 align:middle line:84%
to create the way
the creator did.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Because none of the
aeons really understood

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:84%
the deeper mysteries
of the creator.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And she longed to know
these deeper mysteries.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So Sophia looks outside of this
original sphere of creation,

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:84%
which would be the source and
these aeons or these entities.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:84%
She looks outside of
that sphere of creation.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And she looks into something
called chaos, again,

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:90%
another quantum term.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.240 align:middle line:84%
We have chaos theory
in quantum physics.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.760 align:middle line:84%
But what chaos
really represented

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.187 align:middle line:84%
was the unorganized part
of this spiritual field

00:15:07.187 --> 00:15:09.145 align:middle line:84%
that had not been organized
by the mind of God.

00:15:09.145 --> 00:15:11.965 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in Hermetics, it
would be called prima materia?

00:15:11.965 --> 00:15:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Right.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.080 align:middle line:84%
That would be
another name for it.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Another name for it.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to the
Egyptian lexicon,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
you could almost
say what she was

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.267 align:middle line:84%
doing was a function of
what would be known as ISIS.

00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:24.067 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:24.067 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that now.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:90%
So this is really important.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:31.615 align:middle line:84%
She wants to have experience to
be able to expand her wisdom.

00:15:31.615 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:84%
She is now reaching into
the already existing field

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
of chaos, prima materia,
quantum soup, whatever, chaos.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
She's reaching into it to
put an imprint upon it,

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.745 align:middle line:90%
which is creation, just like--

00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:44.545 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:44.545 --> 00:15:45.345 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yes.

00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
something very interesting.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:84%
She projects her high energy,
her divine essence into chaos.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And something very
weird happens there.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.078 align:middle line:90%
Chaos is not an empty vacuum.

00:16:01.078 --> 00:16:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And science has found--
quantum physics has found there

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.780 align:middle line:90%
is no such thing as a vacuum.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
In space, all around us,
it's seething with virtual

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:84%
particles, particles
that have-- in potential,

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:90%
that have not yet--

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Waiting
to be imprinted.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.358 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: --that have
not yet come into--

00:16:13.358 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:84%
manifested into what
we would call reality.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.893 align:middle line:84%
So chaos is seething
with protomatter.

00:16:19.893 --> 00:16:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, this blows my mind
that they could even give it

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.370 align:middle line:84%
a term like this--
"protomatter," that

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
which becomes before matter,
which is virtual particles.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Chaos is seething with
these virtual particles.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And they swarm around
Sofia like iron filings

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.630 align:middle line:90%
would swarm to a magnet.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And they engulf her.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:84%
They start to activate
with her high energy.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.910 align:middle line:84%
But they're draining
her energy off.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And something is-- new
is starting to form here.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.300 align:middle line:84%
She cries out to heaven,
I am becoming as lead.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Save me from this matter
that I am becoming.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:90%
My light is diminishing.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Save me from this matter.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:03.230 align:middle line:84%
What we see here is the whole
functioning of the God particle

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:90%
in quantum physics.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.837 align:middle line:90%
Now, the God particle--

00:17:05.837 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:84%
there's something that surrounds
our universe called the Higgs

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:84%
field, all
encompassing-- and there

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
are virtual particles
in the Higgs field

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:90%
they call Higgs bosons.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, they discovered
the Higgs bosons in 2012

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
in the giant particle
collider in Switzerland,

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
underneath Switzerland
and France.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:25.167 align:middle line:84%
And they-- it was theorized
for like 50 years.

00:17:25.167 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But they finally found
out it was a reality.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And what the Higgs
bosons do is that when

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
energy enters into our
universe-- and incidentally,

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.700 align:middle line:84%
science has no idea
what energy is.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
where it comes from.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.090 align:middle line:84%
They can manipulate it
to a certain extent.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:90%
But they don't know its origins.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really
understand what energy is.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.255 align:middle line:84%
So energy comes into our
universe from somewhere.

00:17:45.255 --> 00:17:46.055 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:46.055 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:10%
>>CANOVA: And the Higgs
bosons attach themselves

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:10%
to these high streams of
energy and slow them down.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:10%
And they slow them
to the point where

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:10%
they start to take on mass,
because that's what matter is.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Matter is simply energy in
a lower state of vibration.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So they lower the vibration
of this high energy.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to
form mass or matter--

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.560 align:middle line:84%
what was happening
in the Sophia story.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:90%
They swarmed around Sophia.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:90%
They lowered her high energy.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And she cries out,
I'm becoming matter.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:90%
So here, you see the function.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so clear that you
see the function of the God

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.800 align:middle line:84%
particle and the energy-matter
conversion happening

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:90%
in this story right there.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:90%
And that does seem very clear.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
There is a point in this story,
though, that is interesting.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you say in this,
she was, supposedly, only half

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:90%
of the wisdom equation.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:90%
You say she had a counterpart.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Or was she standing
on her own as wisdom?

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: She acted on her own.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:90%
But she was part of a pairing.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now
let's talk about that.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And did the others
have pairings?

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yes, there was--

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, this really gets back into
something very fundamental

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:84%
in understanding the
whole process of creation,

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:84%
which is that although
everything stems from one

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
source, that one source-- the
characteristics of that one

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:90%
source was--

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:84%
divided itself into
a polarity that we

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:90%
call yin-yang, male and female.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was the interaction
of that polarity,

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:84%
that positive and negative,
the interaction between them

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:84%
that generated the light, heat,
and energy to fundamentally

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:90%
spur on creation.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So because these spiritual
beings, the aeons,

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:84%
were made in the
image of their father,

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.360 align:middle line:90%
they too were polarities.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
They had a male and
a female counterpart.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So Sophia had a
male counterpart.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.935 align:middle line:84%
It was given different
names in different texts.

00:19:35.935 --> 00:19:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I'd
be curious to know.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: One of them was
called Thelema or will, OK?

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: So wisdom and
will were a pairing.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:90%
There were other ones.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.630 align:middle line:90%
But I won't digress into that.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.340 align:middle line:90%
But she acted--

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Sophia, the thing
that she did that

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
was radical and represented
the first fall of spirit,

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:90%
the first break from heaven--

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:84%
from the heavenly
realm was that she

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
created without the consent
of her counterpart--

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:84%
her male counterpart and without
the consent of the creator.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So those were the
two preconditions

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:84%
for how creation happened
within the divine realm.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:84%
It would be an agreement
between the male and the female

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:20.100 align:middle line:84%
essentially blessed or
okayed by the "big guy."

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:84%
But Sophia didn't
have any of that.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:90%
She acted completely on her own.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, many
of the texts say

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.438 align:middle line:84%
that she was very imprudent,
and she committed a great sin.

00:20:32.438 --> 00:20:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to debate that later.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: That could be debated.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.065 align:middle line:90%
That could be debated.

00:20:36.065 --> 00:20:38.190 align:middle line:84%
There's two sides of that
coin that we can look at.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.835 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: But getting back
to the Sophia story, so all

00:20:41.835 --> 00:20:45.090 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, this new dimension
of matter was happening.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to caution you
that this is not matter

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:53.143 align:middle line:84%
These were finer, more like
forms of matter, but forms

00:20:53.143 --> 00:20:54.060 align:middle line:90%
of matter nonetheless.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
a field that could

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
be expressed once it had
instruction or imprint or logos

00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:90%
applied to it.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Yeah, and there's
all degrees of matter.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:90%
There's finer degrees.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:03.120 align:middle line:90%
And there's denser degrees.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:90%
We would be pretty dense.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.437 align:middle line:84%
There's finer degrees
of matter that we--

00:21:05.437 --> 00:21:06.729 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And other dimensions.

00:21:06.729 --> 00:21:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: --wouldn't
be able to detect.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So this new dimension of
matter could no longer

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.542 align:middle line:84%
coexist with the
spiritual dimension--

00:21:15.542 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:84%
the high-energy, the
spiritual dimension.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:90%
They were two different states.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:90%
They could not coexist.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So the texts say that this new
dimension was projected apart

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:84%
in a violent upheaval
and exploded out

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:90%
into another dimension.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is that describing?

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well--

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: The Big Bang.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yeah.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So here, we've already seen
the Gnostic texts describing

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
parallel dimensions,

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:84%
the energy-matter conversion
of the God particle,

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.538 align:middle line:84%
the origin of matter,
and the Big Bang.

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And the Big Bang, essentially,
was the appearance

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.665 align:middle line:84%
of something out of nothing, the
appearance of our universe out

00:21:51.665 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:90%
of seemingly nothing.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't mean it
was literally a solo explosion.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.572 align:middle line:90%
It just came out of nothing.

00:21:56.572 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: It came out of
nothing from our standpoint.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:21:59.605 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: From our standpoint.

00:21:59.605 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From our standpoint.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.865 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Because
we're looking at it--

00:22:00.865 --> 00:22:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: --from this
side of the equation.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.730 align:middle line:84%
The other side of
the equation, it

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
would be something
quite different.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.125 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The other
side of the horizon.

00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yeah.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So right there, you
see descriptions

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
of some of the major theories
of modern quantum physics.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And also, I should
mention the quantum field,

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:90%
the virtual particles.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
All these things were
described in the Gnostic texts.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.612 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they didn't always
use the exact same terminology.

00:22:22.612 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have particle
colliders back in those days.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have the technical
capabilities in those days

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:90%
to describe them.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's about as
close as you can

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.172 align:middle line:90%
get to a description of these--

00:22:32.172 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just because
we didn't have machinery

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:84%
to prove it didn't mean
they didn't already

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:90%
know and understand it.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Or have their
ways to describe it.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And have their ways
of describing it, exactly.

00:22:39.745 --> 00:22:40.545 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Exactly.

00:22:40.545 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
we have creation.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.350 align:middle line:84%
At this point, is
that where you would

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:84%
say some of the mere
reflections of the Noble Truths

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.340 align:middle line:84%
started coming into
play, the game of light

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and dark and polarity in terms
of the creation of entities

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.875 align:middle line:84%
that later became influential
in the cosmos and on our planet?

00:22:58.875 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Well, when you
talk about light and dark,

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand
that opposition

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.100 align:middle line:90%
existed from the beginning.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
for opposition was

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that in order for
these created beings

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to be individuals that have free
will, they had to have choice.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So opposition is what
gave them the choice.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And the choice was, at least
as far as Sofia is concerned,

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:84%
you either subordinate
your will to God's will,

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:84%
or you pursue your
own individuality.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
When Sofia fell from heaven,
this was the first fall.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic tradition,
there's more than one fall.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The first fall was
Sofia's fall from heaven.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.657 align:middle line:84%
And what it created was also
the dimension of soul-mind.

00:23:47.657 --> 00:23:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a difference
between soul and spirit.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.255 align:middle line:84%
Most people use those
interchangeably.

00:23:51.255 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: OK.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
The difference-- spirit is
that consciousness that never

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:90%
left the sphere of the source.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Its will is the
will of the source.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:90%
They are individuals.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.130 align:middle line:84%
But they recognize
themselves as themselves.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And they recognize
themselves as the source--

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:90%
as part of the source.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Soul, on the other
hand, is the record

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.495 align:middle line:84%
of spirit pursuing
its own individuality

00:24:13.495 --> 00:24:15.120 align:middle line:84%
through different
realms of experience.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a good
way to describe it.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: And, of course, you
accumulate the Akashic record

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
That all has to do with
soul and soul-mind.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So soul and spirit are
really two different states.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
The dimension that
Sophia created

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:84%
would, of course,
involve ego, because she

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:84%
was acting on her own for
herself for her own experience.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
So ego was part
of that equation.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And opposition,
as you go lower--

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:84%
into lower and lower
levels of creation,

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:84%
can take on the appearance
of what we call evil.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
The opposition in and of itself
in the abstract is not evil.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the devil in
early Judaic tradition

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
was not the horned being with
cloven hooves and everything

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.240 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:84%
He was called the
Angel of Opposition.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was sent by
the creator to create

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:84%
obstacles for human
beings to overcome

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.470 align:middle line:90%
so that they could grow.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But as you get further and
further into denser realms,

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.690 align:middle line:84%
that force of opposition
can become extreme

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and take on the attributes
of what we call evil.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, it
can be so individualistic

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.910 align:middle line:84%
that you think of only
yourself and nobody else.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:90%
And you can hurt other people.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Psychopaths, Hitlers--
that's the extreme

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:90%
that opposition can go to.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So there are shades
of opposition.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:90%
There are shades of shadow.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:90%
And there are shades of light.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not like an either/or.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
nuances in between.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But the dimension
that Sophia created

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.850 align:middle line:84%
as a result of her action was
the dimension of soul-mind

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:58.380 align:middle line:90%
or the dimension of psyche.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, here is where you start
to see light and shadow come

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.460 align:middle line:90%
into play.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you still have the
impulses and the archetypes

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:84%
from the spirit realm
that they came from.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:90%
But they were diluted.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
They now became shadows so
that in the Gnostic texts,

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and I think even in
the Casey tradition,

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:90%
they posited on Earth.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't the
Earth that we know.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:90%
It was like an etheric Earth.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.860 align:middle line:90%
It was a template of--

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:90%
a blueprint of the Earth.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And that would have come
from the mind of the source.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, when in
Sophia's dimension,

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:33.115 align:middle line:84%
they started the beings
there because they

00:26:33.115 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:84%
were looking for
individual experience,

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:90%
started messing with that.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you start to get

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:90%
degrees of light and shadow.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Because the archetypes would
have been the guiding images.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But now these souls
were off for themselves.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And they were developing
their own ways

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000 align:middle line:84%
to use their creative powers,
misusing their creative powers,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.740 align:middle line:90%
you could say, in some ways.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, that misuse
of the creative power

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:84%
led to the second fall of
soul into material experience,

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.440 align:middle line:90%
into material bodies.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that
desire for experience

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.370 align:middle line:84%
was progressing into
all forms, including,

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:84%
finally, a spiritual
being in physical form,

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.130 align:middle line:90%
which is what human beings are.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we're
in more or less one

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
of the denser realms of
creation at this point.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the supposition is that
we have to, through experience,

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:84%
through opposition, learn
our way back toward more

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.380 align:middle line:90%
of the original template.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.367 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain in this body of
work what that would look like?

00:27:39.367 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Yeah, that's
pretty much accurate,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:90%
what you just said.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.005 align:middle line:90%
This is a school.

00:27:44.005 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:84%
We are spiritual beings
having a material experience.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.970 align:middle line:90%
And we're learning things.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:90%
We put ourselves in a box.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And now we have to learn to
get ourselves out of the box.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Gnostic
texts and many of

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:84%
the ancient spiritual
traditions really

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:84%
devoted themselves to teaching
their adepts different ways

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and techniques of regaining that
higher source of consciousness.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And in all honesty, that's
what my book is about.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.080 align:middle line:84%
My book is a way, a roadmap
to try and help people

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.390 align:middle line:90%
have those experiences with--

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.340 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary experiences
with consciousness.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.847 align:middle line:84%
And I call it a map
because, like a map,

00:28:26.847 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:84%
you have to have at least a
couple of coordinates, north

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and south, latitude
and longitude.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, my coordinates are
quantum science on one hand

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and ancient spiritual
wisdom on the other.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're both saying the same
thing in different languages

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.230 align:middle line:90%
at different times.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But they're both indicating
the same matrix or function

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:46.640 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So once people understand
that-- and I think

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.710 align:middle line:90%
it's inspirational to people.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.303 align:middle line:84%
Because you could go
to one of your average

00:28:54.303 --> 00:28:55.970 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-raising
seminar and listen

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:84%
to your favorite
garden-variety guru.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And OK, you might take what
he says on faith because you

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:90%
haven't experienced that.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you hear quantum
science saying the same thing,

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.708 align:middle line:84%
it's aha, well, now I
see there's another side.

00:29:09.708 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:90%
There may be something in this.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.160 align:middle line:84%
This is worth it
for me to pursue.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these truths
that I'm hearing about,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.668 align:middle line:84%
maybe there's a way
that I can find these

00:29:16.668 --> 00:29:19.530 align:middle line:84%
by having the understandings
of these dual understandings.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm trying
to do, is really inspire

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.240 align:middle line:84%
people to their own path
to higher consciousness

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.130 align:middle line:84%
through these two avenues
that create the arena for them

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:32.130 align:middle line:90%
to operate in.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
go back to that then.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the language that

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.970 align:middle line:84%
would be used around this
part of the creation.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we have
this material world

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.290 align:middle line:90%
that's showing up as polarized.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And now we're dropping
into material reality.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:47.750 align:middle line:84%
In quantum terms, you call it
disruption of the quantum foam,

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:48.785 align:middle line:90%
leading to materiality.

00:29:48.785 --> 00:29:51.192 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Yeah, well,
think of it this way.

00:29:51.192 --> 00:29:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Remember, we started off by--

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Disruption
being the key word there.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Right.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Remember how we
started off talking

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.320 align:middle line:84%
about the source creating
this infinite quantum field.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can think of
it as a smooth energy.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:84%
But it gets compartmentalized
at some points.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I can
liken it to you is this.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.340 align:middle line:90%
All right, I live in Florida.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And we have things called
waterspouts in Florida.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Waterspouts are essentially
waterborne tornadoes.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.083 align:middle line:90%
And they just develop.

00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even sure
why they happen.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But you can have a
smooth river flowing.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you have this disruption

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.410 align:middle line:84%
of this waterspout, which
is a little cyclone.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be near them.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And they can do
some real damage.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.535 align:middle line:84%
But you look at that
waterspout, and you

00:30:40.535 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:84%
look at that as something
different from the river,

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.820 align:middle line:84%
the water that it came
from, but it's not.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.170 align:middle line:90%
The water is smooth.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.030 align:middle line:90%
But this is a disruption.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.783 align:middle line:84%
And the disruption
takes on the appearance

00:30:49.783 --> 00:30:50.700 align:middle line:90%
of something separate.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:90%
But it's really not.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So in this manner,
our reality is

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.560 align:middle line:84%
like a blemish or a blip
in this quantum field.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like a compartment
in this quantum field.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And within that
compartment, we operate

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.580 align:middle line:84%
under certain laws and
perceptions and beliefs

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.520 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.320 align:middle line:84%
But we're really all
part of that stream--

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.120 align:middle line:90%
that main stream.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.148 align:middle line:84%
We're just kind of
cul-de-sacked into believing

00:31:12.148 --> 00:31:13.440 align:middle line:90%
that we're something different.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk--
let's go back to Sofia.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So this has all
occurred under her power

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:90%
and her own creative abilities.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And there comes a
point where she's

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:84%
beginning to have
second thoughts

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:28.090 align:middle line:90%
and repent over her creations.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.455 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that as
through the lens of this work.

00:31:31.455 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: This is where it
can get a little bit trippy.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.420 align:middle line:84%
The shadow that we
spoke about takes

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.930 align:middle line:90%
on a quasi-spiritual form.

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:44.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a being that was called
Yaldabaoth or the Demiurge.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.565 align:middle line:84%
And it really represented
all the negative attributes

00:31:48.565 --> 00:31:50.830 align:middle line:84%
of soul-mind,
this-- the egotism,

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.110 align:middle line:84%
the selfishness,
the feeling that I

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:90%
am the center of the universe.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And nothing else
exists beyond me.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And that being,
essentially, really,

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.260 align:middle line:84%
was the product of
all our thoughts.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.150 align:middle line:84%
That our negative thoughts
feed these beings.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, Carlos Castaneda
called them flyers.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:09.940 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics called
them archons.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:90%
They were these strange beings.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally,
it's spilled over

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:18.310 align:middle line:84%
into ufology with Grays
and things like that.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But they're all really
describing the same phenomenon,

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:27.100 align:middle line:84%
which is a centralized
thought process that

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:32.320 align:middle line:84%
contains the shadow, the
negative aspects of life

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.153 align:middle line:90%
outside the source--

00:32:33.153 --> 00:32:34.737 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost
like an entity that's

00:32:34.737 --> 00:32:37.120 align:middle line:84%
been created through perpetual,
repeated thought forms?

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Well, that's exactly
where I was getting to.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And these entities are
created and perpetuated

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and fed through the negative
emotions of human beings.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.080 align:middle line:90%
They feed on them.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And so Sophia saw
all this happening

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and realized that,
OK, I've done this.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And she goes through a
series of repentance.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.780 align:middle line:84%
In the "Pistis Sophia," is
it-- there's, I don't know,

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.910 align:middle line:84%
four, five, or six chapters
of her just repenting

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:02.710 align:middle line:90%
and repenting.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And she is allowed to ascend
to a level where she--

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:13.030 align:middle line:84%
it's not all the way back to
the source, where she came from.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But she is allowed to ascend
to a higher level, where

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:19.570 align:middle line:84%
she essentially can work
as a guiding world spirit

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:26.047 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring the lost
souls back to this way station.

00:33:26.047 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:90%
I won't call it purgatory.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.504 align:middle line:84%
But I'll call it more like a
way station, where once the--

00:33:30.504 --> 00:33:34.780 align:middle line:84%
enough of the soul consciousness
of a particular sphere

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.600 align:middle line:84%
has been enlightened,
that's the tipping point.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, some
wonderful speculative things

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:90%
could happen.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.840 align:middle line:90%
That could be where kingdom--

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.590 align:middle line:84%
the kingdom of heaven
comes down to Earth.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.410 align:middle line:84%
That could be where the
veil between the spiritual

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and the physical
ceases to exist.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And we can do what
I think we were

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.600 align:middle line:84%
able to do at one
time, which has come

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.100 align:middle line:84%
in and out of
physical body, come

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.930 align:middle line:90%
in and out of physical forms.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Casey said, and in one of my
books, I write about the fact

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.260 align:middle line:84%
that there was an early
Atlantis-like civilization.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And when they first
came here, they

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.170 align:middle line:84%
could come in and
out of physical form.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, they began to
identify with the boundaries

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.460 align:middle line:90%
of their skin.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.969 align:middle line:84%
And they became
trapped in the idea

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:11.260 align:middle line:84%
that they are these
physical beings.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the
culture's lowered

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: But I had the
perception from long ago

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.790 align:middle line:84%
that we are the
fingers of God that

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.560 align:middle line:90%
touch the face of this Earth.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And that our purpose is to
spiritualize the material

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.139 align:middle line:84%
and bring the experience of
the material back to spirit

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:29.659 align:middle line:84%
so that spirit can have
experience in all forms,

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:90%
including being a physical form.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way the
source experiences--

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:35.980 align:middle line:90%
We're the relays.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.750 align:middle line:90%
We're the conduits.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.120 align:middle line:84%
In this electrical grid,
the source is there.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We're the relay stations
that both contribute

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.429 align:middle line:84%
to the creation of
reality, but feed back

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:47.510 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
that to the source.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:50.858 align:middle line:84%
So we have a very-- unlike
Christianity and Judaism,

00:34:50.858 --> 00:34:52.900 align:middle line:84%
which has told us that
we're these lowly sinners.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:53.860 align:middle line:90%
And we ticked off God.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, don't buy it.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: And now we're
forever trying to get back

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.000 align:middle line:90%
into his good graces.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work like that.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.960 align:middle line:84%
We are the very important bridge
between matter and spirit.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And this gets us
into a larger debate

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.050 align:middle line:90%
and the word I was a little--

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.690 align:middle line:84%
searching for a little bit
ago regarding these creations.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I've always
wondered-- it was egregore.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:84%
We create these
egregores, which are

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.700 align:middle line:84%
these composite
entities of our thoughts

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.330 align:middle line:90%
and feelings and emotions.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:21.670 align:middle line:90%
And we give them an identity.

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:23.080 align:middle line:90%
And they're all around us.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.950 align:middle line:84%
We're creating
them all the time.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we can
be creating the opposite.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:84%
We can be creating a very
positive egregore of sorts

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.810 align:middle line:84%
by the way of our own
understanding of life going--

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:36.850 align:middle line:90%
returning to the Noble Truths.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And living in a sense
of compassion and grace,

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.770 align:middle line:84%
we can create the
very thing you're

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:44.180 align:middle line:84%
talking about-- the bridge
that goes back to that,

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.300 align:middle line:90%
but through Sophia's efforts.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.150 align:middle line:84%
But one thing when you're
talking, I keep thinking Eve.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
all the sin has been

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.400 align:middle line:90%
hung on Sophia in this story.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.870 align:middle line:90%
She was the downfall.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, the feminine
being the downfall,

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.560 align:middle line:90%
do you see it that way?

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: No.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.040 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic
texts, the serpent

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.390 align:middle line:90%
was actually an agent of wisdom.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And Sophia-- or I should
say Eve at that point,

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.230 align:middle line:84%
actually awoke from
the shadow state

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that the-- as you call them,
the egregores or the archons

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:90%
had created.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, she
was recovering wisdom.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And I will say this just
to go back because you

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.180 align:middle line:90%
mentioned about the egregores.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And the Gospel of Philip, which
is one of my favorite Gnostic

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Gospels, it said
God created men.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Now men create gods.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very true.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:43.125 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: And that's what
he really was speaking of,

00:36:43.125 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:84%
the egregores or
the thought forms

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.510 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So the feminine was exalted
at one point in history.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.350 align:middle line:84%
We had matriarchal and
even matrilineal societies.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Like Egypt before 3000
BC was both a matriarchal

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.540 align:middle line:90%
and a matrilineal society.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It eventually shifted
and became patriarchal.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.885 align:middle line:84%
And I have my theories
about why that happened.

00:37:05.885 --> 00:37:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I think when spirit came down
into this world after a while,

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:13.840 align:middle line:90%
it had to live in danger--

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:84%
saber-toothed tigers,
things trying to kill it,

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.623 align:middle line:90%
things happening, bad weather.

00:37:17.623 --> 00:37:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When survival
became the imperative.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Survival
became imperative.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And the-- it was really more
of a left brain function

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:84%
to deal with that, how
to organize yourself

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.110 align:middle line:90%
against your environment.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:32.655 align:middle line:84%
And that's a patriarchal
male way of looking at it.

00:37:32.655 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and also the male

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.550 align:middle line:84%
was more equipped to do that
just by size and strength

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.970 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yeah.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.030 align:middle line:90%
So there was a shift.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But what the feminine always
represented was the really--

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:50.590 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, the gateway
back to the spiritual world.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Because it involves feeling.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.200 align:middle line:90%
And it involves insight.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.610 align:middle line:90%
And it involves intuition.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you have those qualities,
you're on a spiritual path.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.030 align:middle line:84%
You're already connected
to the spirit--

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.840 align:middle line:90%
to spiritual hub.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.595 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't mean
that only women have that.

00:38:04.595 --> 00:38:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Don't mistake that.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's feminine,
not necessarily women.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Jung called it
the anima and the animus,

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
the male and the female and
the female and the male.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And very much like
a saying of Jesus,

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said when you
make the male female

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.535 align:middle line:84%
and the female male, and
you make the two as one,

00:38:21.535 --> 00:38:23.470 align:middle line:84%
then you will realize
the kingdom of heaven.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Jung said the exact same thing.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.450 align:middle line:84%
That when you merge those,
you become an individuated,

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.520 align:middle line:90%
actualized human being.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.110 align:middle line:84%
That you become
the essence of what

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.430 align:middle line:90%
it means to be a human being.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:34.430 align:middle line:90%
You are in balance now.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: And so but the
feminine quality always played

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.580 align:middle line:90%
a very important role in that.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.320 align:middle line:90%
And I liken it to a rocket ship.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Because there's two basic
systems in a rocket ship.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.850 align:middle line:90%
You have the fuel.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
guidance system.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So the fuel is the
feminine aspect of it.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.848 align:middle line:90%
That is the insight to uplift.

00:38:53.848 --> 00:38:55.390 align:middle line:84%
That there's something
else up there.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And I want to work
my way towards it.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.320 align:middle line:84%
But the guidance system is what
helps you shape your direction

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.910 align:middle line:90%
once you've achieved liftoff.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.760 align:middle line:84%
One is not good
without the other.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.722 align:middle line:84%
Without the fuel, you
don't get off the ground.

00:39:07.722 --> 00:39:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Without the guidance system,
you just go around in circles.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So they both play a
very important part.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:13.365 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back to logos
and prima materia.

00:39:13.365 --> 00:39:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yeah.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.152 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They work together
to create whatever reality

00:39:16.152 --> 00:39:17.370 align:middle line:90%
is intended to be created.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: They
must work together.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.612 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the way
the original polarity was.

00:39:20.612 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, and
still is, obviously,

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.285 align:middle line:84%
throughout the universe and
throughout the dimensions.

00:39:24.285 --> 00:39:25.085 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Right.

00:39:25.085 --> 00:39:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now we get
to the little debate about

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:31.490 align:middle line:90%
but was this all by design?

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Was it the intention
of the great source

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and the great creator to only
have the thought forms that

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.710 align:middle line:84%
are all essentially
of goodness, or was

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:44.040 align:middle line:84%
it to expand beyond
that to give universes

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.830 align:middle line:84%
of experienced
birth, which Sophia

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:90%
was responsible for doing?

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yeah.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:53.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems to me like
she's the one that created this

00:39:53.335 --> 00:39:54.135 align:middle line:90%
entire--

00:39:54.135 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: The Gnostics had a
bit of a dual view on that.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.400 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, they described
her as being imprudent, rash.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.020 align:middle line:84%
They even described
her as being a whore.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:05.820 align:middle line:90%
That she--

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Find
that in the Bible.

00:40:07.195 --> 00:40:11.097 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: That she
adulterated her high energies

00:40:11.097 --> 00:40:12.180 align:middle line:90%
with these lower elements.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.380 align:middle line:84%
They didn't mean it
in a carnal sense,

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.210 align:middle line:90%
but in a spiritual sense.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So that she was a prostitute
in a spiritual sense.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.053 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that was
one school of thought.

00:40:19.053 --> 00:40:21.367 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: But another school
of thought was that no,

00:40:21.367 --> 00:40:22.950 align:middle line:84%
this was all known
from the beginning.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, I tend to go with
that latter belief

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.190 align:middle line:84%
because I believe you
have, essentially,

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.510 align:middle line:90%
an all-knowing source.

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And I have to believe
that although I

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.920 align:middle line:84%
do believe that there's degrees
of freedom and latitude allowed

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.010 align:middle line:84%
within that scheme of
things, I do believe

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:90%
it's working towards an--

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.075 align:middle line:90%
a guided ending.

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And so in that
regard, yeah, I think

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:49.445 align:middle line:84%
it was foreseen that
this would happen.

00:40:49.445 --> 00:40:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that is how
it was to have been.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.460 align:middle line:90%
And hence, we're here.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:55.260 align:middle line:90%
We're embodied.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.593 align:middle line:90%
And we're able to talk about it.

00:40:56.593 --> 00:40:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So going back to the
purpose of your work, which

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.010 align:middle line:84%
is, as we spoke
about before, we're

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:04.290 align:middle line:84%
creating gods every minute
by our own thought--

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.400 align:middle line:90%
collective thought.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So now to create that critical
mass of that positive noble

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.440 align:middle line:84%
thought again to take
this species of humanity

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.890 align:middle line:84%
back more toward our rightful
place and our rightful state

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.720 align:middle line:84%
of being, what do you think
is most required of each of us

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.520 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: Well,
obviously, you have

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.970 align:middle line:84%
to have some spiritual
attributes in your life.

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:30.670 align:middle line:84%
You have to have some vision
of spirit in your life.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's required
is you have to work

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.820 align:middle line:90%
towards it a little bit.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.400 align:middle line:90%
It's like anything else.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't just
drop in your lap.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, OK, for some
people, like myself,

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.355 align:middle line:84%
things happen to me
that I didn't seek,

00:41:44.355 --> 00:41:45.990 align:middle line:90%
that just were there.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.640 align:middle line:90%
OK, that happens to some people.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Other people, they have to work
more towards that revelation

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.390 align:middle line:84%
or peeling those layers
away for things to happen.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But we're all capable
of that happening.

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:01.455 align:middle line:84%
I think the thing to
really understand is this--

00:42:01.455 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a big believer in
a lot of New Age adages.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing
about being co-creators

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.450 align:middle line:84%
is really true from
a quantum standpoint,

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:14.850 align:middle line:84%
as well as from a
spiritual standpoint.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I likened it to, like
I said, the source--

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.710 align:middle line:84%
let's say the source is the
raw power of a power grid

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.960 align:middle line:84%
like we have power grids
that run this country.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.430 align:middle line:90%
The source is the raw power.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, raw power is never
transmitted for use.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.480 align:middle line:90%
It has to be stepped down.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's stepped down into
the-- into relay stations.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're the relay
stations in effect.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:35.605 align:middle line:84%
So we are part of
that energy, even

00:42:35.605 --> 00:42:37.980 align:middle line:84%
though in a limited and stepped
down sense-- stepped down

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.440 align:middle line:84%
But we can increase
our frequencies.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.390 align:middle line:84%
We can increase our
rate of vibration

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:45.900 align:middle line:84%
by the level of understanding
and experience we have.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just enough
to have understanding.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a
difference between knowledge

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:55.450 align:middle line:84%
gained by books and knowledge
gained by experience.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge gain by experience
is the higher form.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I could tell you, for
instance, that fire burns.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.983 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know
that for sure until you

00:43:01.983 --> 00:43:03.150 align:middle line:90%
stick your hand in the fire.

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Then you own it.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.760 align:middle line:90%
You know what fire's about.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.850 align:middle line:90%
That's knowledge by experience.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So the point that I'm trying
to tell people is-- in fact,

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.578 align:middle line:84%
I often start off my public
speaking by saying to people,

00:43:15.578 --> 00:43:17.620 align:middle line:84%
don't believe a damn thing
I'm going to tell you.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And they sit there scratching
their heads saying, well, what

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.550 align:middle line:90%
do we pay to come to this for?

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying I'm not telling you
not to pay attention to me.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.198 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not telling you not
to take in and internalize

00:43:26.198 --> 00:43:27.490 align:middle line:90%
the information I'm giving you.

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:30.040 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is you
don't have to believe me.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.290 align:middle line:84%
What you have to do
is get to the point

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:36.220 align:middle line:84%
where you have your own
experiences and revelations

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.090 align:middle line:84%
with this source
that's out there.

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you become
your own prophet.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't need somebody
like me to listen to.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:44.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to look up
to me or any other teacher

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:90%
or guru or anything else.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.850 align:middle line:10%
You can own this
in your own self.

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:52.930 align:middle line:10%
And all I'm doing is trying to
give the people a roadmap to,

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.705 align:middle line:10%
maybe, maximize
the ability to have

00:43:55.705 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:10%
those kinds of experiences.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:58.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To go into
connection with source.

00:43:58.345 --> 00:44:00.820 align:middle line:84%
To go into connection with
your own soul and/or mind.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: What I found
is source is like a radio

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.710 align:middle line:90%
station broadcasting 24/7.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And until I had certain
revelations or awakenings,

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.492 align:middle line:84%
I was like somebody
trying to tune that radio.

00:44:11.492 --> 00:44:12.700 align:middle line:90%
All I was getting was static.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.280 align:middle line:84%
But then I finally hit
on that one frequency.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.160 align:middle line:10%
And it became clear to me
that it was like a 24/7

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.330 align:middle line:10%
broadcast of information.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:22.090 align:middle line:10%
And it was information that
could really enhance one's life

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:26.020 align:middle line:10%
and help you really get a
grasp on what reality was about

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.440 align:middle line:10%
and realize that this is
just the bottom ladder

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:33.490 align:middle line:10%
of multiple dimensions
that are above us

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.970 align:middle line:10%
and that we can get information
from those dimensions

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.800 align:middle line:10%
that we can come and
bring back and use here,

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.218 align:middle line:10%
which was the
basis of shamanism.

00:44:41.218 --> 00:44:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Shamans were those
people that walked

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.400 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, brought
back information for healing,

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.600 align:middle line:84%
for guiding their tribes,
and so forth and so on.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Agreed.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a time to be
our own shaman.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We can go to the higher mind,
which is connected to the all.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Exactly.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so just
finding that, like you say,

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.190 align:middle line:84%
hitting on that
frequency so that you

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.800 align:middle line:84%
can hear that voice
because it's so clear, so

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.740 align:middle line:84%
clean, and, usually,
quite logical too.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's not laden
with all the emotions

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:06.280 align:middle line:90%
that we have in this realm.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Might it be fair
also to say in terms

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:11.140 align:middle line:84%
of the collective of the human
soup that we're creating,

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:16.600 align:middle line:84%
just to let go of cynicism in
favor of actual discernment?

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Cynicism is really born out
of fear of others' projections

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:21.730 align:middle line:90%
on us.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.480 align:middle line:84%
To let go of cynicism
and maybe start

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.480 align:middle line:84%
seeing the good in each
other a little bit more,

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.300 align:middle line:84%
might that help the
soup start, essentially,

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.310 align:middle line:90%
simmering a bit faster--

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:31.172 align:middle line:90%
simmer a bit faster?

00:45:31.172 --> 00:45:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CANOVA: I think fear
is probably the greatest

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:33.370 align:middle line:90%
impediment--

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: --to human existence.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
wrote this book.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe the
degree to which you

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.030 align:middle line:84%
increase your consciousness,
you reduce your fear.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a
better understanding

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.240 align:middle line:90%
of how things work.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And things start to
make more sense to you.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:53.688 align:middle line:84%
You no longer start to feel
like a random leaf being

00:45:53.688 --> 00:45:54.730 align:middle line:90%
blown around in the wind.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:56.980 align:middle line:84%
You start to understand the
nature of the wind itself.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I agree.

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right on it.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And, as we said early
in the beginning

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.380 align:middle line:84%
or I said, anyway, to
me, Sophia's God's girl.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.820 align:middle line:84%
She got the whole
game in motion.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.445 align:middle line:84%
So we get to
experience all of this.

00:46:08.445 --> 00:46:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yeah.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.440 align:middle line:90%
We can thank Sophia.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.260 align:middle line:84%
You either thank
Sophia or curse her.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:13.680 align:middle line:90%
I guess--

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I thank her.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: --they did both.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.970 align:middle line:84%
But like I say,
I mean, I believe

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:21.090 align:middle line:90%
there's a purpose to humanity.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I believe we serve a purpose,
which I described earlier.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And we ought to start
thinking of ourselves

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.815 align:middle line:84%
as living a little bit more of
an exalted state of existence--

00:46:29.815 --> 00:46:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: --rather than these--

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Poor sinners--

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: --lowly sinners that--

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --begging
for forgiveness.

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yeah.

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because we exist.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Yeah.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our biggest sin
was, what, being born--

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Born.

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: --being born.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.150 align:middle line:90%
How do you get beyond that?

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and I are
on the same page, Peter.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And thank you so much.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.350 align:middle line:84%
You're really fun to talk
to about all of this.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:47.975 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
times, especially when

00:46:47.975 --> 00:46:50.790 align:middle line:84%
you get into the quantum
realm, it can be quite heavy.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And you keep it
fun and accessible.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much
for joining me today.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CANOVA: Thanks for having me.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the book is
titled "Quantum Spirituality."

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.230 align:middle line:10%
And you can go down all
those rabbit holes yourself

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.850 align:middle line:10%
and connect with
your higher self.

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:06.060 align:middle line:10%
