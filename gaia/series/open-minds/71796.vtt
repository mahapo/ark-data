00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: From kings
and queens to presidents

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.189 align:middle line:84%
and dictators,
people have always

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:84%
been looking to have
an advantage in life,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:90%
and that includes you and me.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:84%
What if we knew which
fork to take in the road?

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.730 align:middle line:84%
How about knowing what's
causing physical pain

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:84%
or which relationship
is going to serve us?

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Jean Slatter is here
today to talk about one

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite
subjects, dowsing.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a science as old as
the hills and as reliable

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:84%
if you know how to do it without
interference from the ego.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:84%
You may remember Jean from
our interview regarding

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.657 align:middle line:90%
her book Hiring The Heavens.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Jean, it's wonderful
to have you back.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN SLATTER:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
these two dovetail.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Hiring The Heavens
was a book that

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
focused on connecting
with higher guidance.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.895 align:middle line:84%
And I love the term
hiring the heavens.

00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:11.395 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's
ourselves, whether it's

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:13.490 align:middle line:84%
the angelic realm,
whatever we're

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:84%
able to contact higher guidance
through various modalities.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about before
writing Hiring The Heavens.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:84%
For years, you
were a naturopath.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And you used this as a
device-- this particular tool

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.280 align:middle line:84%
of dowsing-- to be able to
determine and ferret out

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:84%
very mysterious origins
to problems people

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
couldn't get answers
to from medicine.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: I always say that
dowsing is the most self

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:10%
empowering tool of intuition.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:10%
And it's something
that anybody can do.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:10%
And I began to study
dowsing about 25 years ago

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:10%
and it became my go to method
for working with clients.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You can have 100
clients come in all

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:90%
complaining of the same issue.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's say they all
have stomach issues.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do you know
what is causing it?

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I will guarantee that there
will be 100 reasons why.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It's so unique.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And with a pendulum you can
get to what is really going on

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and what is the unique
issue for that person.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So I feel badly for doctors
who only have the opportunity

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
to listen to someone
and hear their symptoms

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and go by that because
the reality is what

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:84%
is causing something
can be so unique

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and is based upon every day
that person has ever lived,

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.535 align:middle line:84%
including past lives and
up into this moment in time

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
could all be
contributing to what's

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:90%
going on with their health.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Let's talk.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:84%
What about-- you must
have had a lot of people

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.980 align:middle line:84%
that showed symptoms
of fibromyalgia, which

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
has been almost termed as
a kind of a garbage bucket

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
diagnosis of general pain
that no one can figure out

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:90%
the source of.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a moment, pain.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.830 align:middle line:84%
That's a really big
one with people.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:90%
And some of your experiences.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if you can recall a
couple of case histories

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
were someone came in with
this all over generalized pain

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and some of the unique--
unique cases you ex--

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.910 align:middle line:84%
or-- what am I looking--
inspiring events that

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.995 align:middle line:90%
caused it.

00:03:19.995 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well, I
remember a client that

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:84%
had been to so many
different professionals

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what
was going on with her.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.330 align:middle line:84%
She would be having doubling
over pain, aching all over,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
couldn't figure out
what was going on,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and this had been going
on for about a year.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:84%
When she came to see me
through using a pendulum,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
we found out that it had to
do with empty nest syndrome.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And it came about when her last
of her children left the house.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And she felt this
emptiness and felt

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
that she wasn't now of
value and had nothing

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.890 align:middle line:90%
to contribute to the family.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And once we got to
the root of that,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
she was able to pick out
a therapist to work with.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.939 align:middle line:84%
And that solved her
aches and pains.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Really?

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Just went away?

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.808 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
just knowing that.

00:04:06.808 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: What about
some unusual situations

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
where people come
in and say their toe

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.016 align:middle line:84%
hurts but it's actually, maybe,
something in their shoulder?

00:04:15.016 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: That's right.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:90%
So we often have referring pain.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So something that is
going on in your toe

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
might have to do
with an emotion.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.455 align:middle line:84%
It could have to do with an
event, an injury in the body.

00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It could have to do with
a lack of a nutrient.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.656 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:04:31.656 --> 00:04:33.030 align:middle line:84%
You can find out
through dowsing.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And you
used all of those.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:84%
You used the dowsing to
determine all of those things.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I did.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.268 align:middle line:90%
It was my go to method.

00:04:38.268 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I did not have a session
without using my pendulum.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.232 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And I know you had
a pretty good success rate.

00:04:43.232 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I did.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Because we've
talked about that before.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I bring that
up because I want

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.565 align:middle line:84%
people to understand
this is not woo woo.

00:04:52.565 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It isn't.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:90%
It looks mysterious.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:84%
It looks like there's some
kind of magic going on, but it

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:90%
isn't.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Once I explain how
dowsing happens,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
it's something that
you'll say, oh,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
not only does that
make sense but I

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:84%
understand how I
can do this now.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.896 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And it takes it out of
that realm of woo woo

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.811 align:middle line:84%
and into something
that makes sense.

00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Talk about some
of the history of dowsing.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:10%
>>SLATTER: Well
dowsing, they say,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:10%
has been around all the way
back to the Egyptian times

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:10%
and finding pendulums in
tombs and that sort of thing.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:10%
But we definitely know
that water witching, which

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.190 align:middle line:10%
is an aspect of
dowsing, has been around

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:10%
since the 15th century.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.790 align:middle line:10%
And they used it
a lot in Germany

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.570 align:middle line:10%
where dowsers-- water
witchers-- would find water.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, even with all
the sophisticated, geological

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
equipment that we have, we
still call upon a water dowser

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:90%
to find a site for a well.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Actually,
I was shocked

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.130 align:middle line:84%
to find out because
sometimes you

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:84%
don't know about
your parents, right?

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And my father and I
were talking about-- I

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:84%
don't know why we were talking
about dowsing at one point.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, well that's how
we found the well on our land.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea he had
engaged a dowser for that.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And they struck
it the first time.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's been a
viable well ever since.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And years ago, maybe
about 33 years ago

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:84%
when I was first
exposed to dowsing,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.210 align:middle line:84%
it was through someone
who was saying,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is fun
little party trick.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
what you do is you

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:84%
get a yes or no
with this pendulum.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So you had to learn
how to do that.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you would drop
it three times right here

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:84%
in the curve between the
forefinger and the thumb.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.492 align:middle line:90%
And it would respond yes.

00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And when it stopped
responding that

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.700 align:middle line:84%
was the end of the
information telling you

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:84%
how many children
a person had had.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: How interesting.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah!

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And because I was so
naive, I thought, OK, sure.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.504 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:06:48.504 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I did it at
my own baby shower.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:90%
I went around the room.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people
I knew the history of.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Some I didn't know as well.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
women-- I remember I

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.717 align:middle line:84%
was so shocked
because it came up

00:06:59.717 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:90%
that she had had three children.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:90%
But I knew she'd only had two.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:90%
And one of them had died.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know,
this is interesting.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So my girlfriends
started doing it.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:90%
My mother started doing it.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:90%
And it was really accurate.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
What made you start, kind
of, experimenting with it

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.272 align:middle line:84%
and choose to go into
becoming a master of it?

00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well, a very
similar type thing.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I had actually gone
to see a chiropractor.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And this was the first time
I had been to a chiropractor.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And after our session, he
said to me, you know Jean,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.759 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you if you are
deficient in any nutrients.

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:90%
And I said, really?

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:90%
How could you do that?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, watch this.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And he went into his closet,
pulled out a wire hanger,

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and began to untwist it,
straighten it out, and bob it

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.305 align:middle line:90%
up and down on his hip.

00:07:46.305 --> 00:07:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, yeah.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:90%
That's primitive.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: For me, this was so
bizarre I thought he was, like,

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:90%
a little off his rocker there.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:84%
But what he determined
from that was

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:90%
that I was low on manganese.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I went across the
street to a health food store.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And I struck up a
conversation with a lady

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
there telling her about this
strange chiropractor next door

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:90%
and what he did.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And then, she said the
most unusual thing.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
She said, you know, I think
you'd be interested in dowsing.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:90%
I had never heard the word.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's dowsing?

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And then she began to tell
me about a group called

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:84%
the American Society of
Dowsers and that they

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.990 align:middle line:90%
had a local meeting.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.160 align:middle line:90%
I went and I was hooked.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.392 align:middle line:90%
That began 25 years ago.

00:08:33.392 --> 00:08:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, as
I said in the intro,

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:84%
it's one of my favorite subjects
because I agree with you.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can do
that, and it's one

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
of the best tools we have for
accessing our subconscious

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.764 align:middle line:84%
field of information
and also-- and we're

00:08:48.764 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:84%
going to go into the difference
in a little bit-- and also

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:90%
the higher guidance.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd first
like to do is we

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.170 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
water witching.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was mentioning that my
father used that modality.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's common enough that
it even made the evening news.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take a look
at a little video of a guy that

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:90%
found water in the desert.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>Most deserts don't
provide scenes like this.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:10%
But the Aquatrac company now
pumps 5,000 gallons a minute

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:10%
from this test well in the
middle of a barren valley.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:10%
They worked hard to find it.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:10%
>>A lot of good science
and a lot of luck.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:10%
>>They used satellite imaging.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:10%
High tech radar.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>And then we actually had
an old fashioned water witch

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:90%
come out.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.374 align:middle line:90%
>>Call me a water dowser.

00:09:30.374 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a witch.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm a Christian.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.970 align:middle line:10%
>>Jack Coel searched the area
with his tools of the trade.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:84%
When he got to this spot,
he looked up and said--

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>This is going to be
my biggest well ever.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Turns out his water
dowsing worked wonders.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Now I know what 5,000
gallons a minute looks like.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.675 align:middle line:90%
And the water's great.

00:09:49.675 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:90%
The quality is good, too.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:90%
That's real nice.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So I
want you to explain.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, when I felt it and when
I saw it, when the rods moved,

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I knew we found the
biggest well ever.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's
actually happening?

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Explain it in a more
technical or scientific way.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: This is what I
love to enlighten people

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
about because it
looks like it's magic.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It looks like there's some
mystery going on here but there

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:90%
really isn't.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:90%
So think about this, Regina.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.200 align:middle line:84%
In this air space
right now, there

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:84%
are numerable radio stations,
telephone conversations,

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
TV signals in this
very airspace.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But we don't hear
it, we can't see it

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have
a receiver, right?

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:84%
But if we did and we set a
radio receiver here and turned

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:84%
the dial, we could pick up
any number of radio stations.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:90%
That's how dowsing works.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything is energy and
has an energy signature.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And what you train
yourself to do--

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and you are the instrument,
not the pendulum.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:90%
You are the instrument.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:84%
You train yourself
to be the receiver

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and to lock onto the
frequency of whatever it

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:90%
is that you're dowsing about.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And you learn to turn
this internal dial.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And your muscles respond to the
signal that you're picking up.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's like this, you are
actually training a muscle

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
in your arm to
move the pendulum.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning, I
always tell people train it.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:84%
You are in training so you
tell the pendulum what you want

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to see for a yes and what
you want to see for a no.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:90%
That trains this muscle.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, you work
with it long enough

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:84%
until it becomes a
subconscious response.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like anything else
that you learn to do.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's learning to ski
or learning to write your name

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:90%
or learning to play the piano.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:84%
At first it has to be a very
strong conscious attempt.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, you are
training your mind

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and consciously thinking
about every note on the piano

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:90%
that you want to hit.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.180 align:middle line:84%
But what you're waiting
for is when the muscles

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
learn that and have
a memory of it.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And it can be a
very quick learning curve.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So water witching
has been around for centuries.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's a mass consciousness
that you tap into.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So when you are out with either
the Y rods or willow stick,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
you are actually tapping into
a mass consciousness that

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:84%
is already there that says this
is what you're looking for.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
vibration of water.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And your muscles already
tap into that experience.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:84%
The first time I did that,
it was as if the y rod almost

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.917 align:middle line:84%
could throw me over
because it was so strong.

00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:44.375 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: But
this also is-- this

00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:84%
is interfacing with
your intention.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.969 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: The
pictures in your mind

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and your intention to
find water, obviously.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: That's how you--

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: If you don't
have the intention,

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.349 align:middle line:84%
the rods aren't
going to do a thing.

00:12:54.349 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
You can walk right over the
potential well under your feet.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So the intention is dialing
into the frequency of the water.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And then your body
has been trained

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.240 align:middle line:84%
to then reflect that
information outwardly.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
skill of dowsing is

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
learning to turn that
internal dial by intention.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And the more specific you
can get, the more accurate

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:90%
you can receive information.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So again, like a
radio, if you're

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:27.922 align:middle line:84%
trying to tune in to
97.3 and you're on 97.1,

00:13:27.922 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:90%
it's a little staticky.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.504 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
hear it real clear.

00:13:30.504 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you can lock
on to 97.3, you're

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
going to get that
signal loud and clear.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And so it is, when you're
dowsing for anything,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
the more you can lock
into that with intention,

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.130 align:middle line:84%
the more accurate
your dowsing can be.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, you are
the instrument.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:84%
The information is
coming through you.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, you are going
to move the pendulum.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Not consciously
but unconsciously.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.035 align:middle line:84%
And often times people say
when they look at dowsers,

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:57.624 align:middle line:90%
well, I saw her hand move.

00:13:57.624 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well see,
that was a big one

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:84%
because I know I always
try to be just as still.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, put my elbow on the
table, be as still as possible,

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:90%
and it still goes crazy.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.555 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: I mean,
either way, it works.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Either way.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.736 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And then I
thought, oh no, they're

00:14:09.736 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:90%
making the pendulum move.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And for years I thought
that that was-- well,

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:84%
you're just telling it to say
whatever you want to hear,

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.310 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Explain why that's not true.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:20.773 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It is not true.

00:14:20.773 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there's no
power in the pendulum itself.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:84%
You are the instrument and
this is a meter to read,

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:84%
which makes it great for getting
confidence with your intuition.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So you have something
to actually look at

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
to see is this a
yes or is this a no

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:90%
rather than just tuning it.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So it helps to build your
confidence for your intuition.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But make no mistake, you are
going to move the pendulum.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Whether you are someone who
has a very tiny swing or a very

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:90%
flamboyant one.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.940 align:middle line:90%
That's just your style.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The key is being
able to decipher

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.820 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
your conscious mind

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:00.002 align:middle line:84%
trying to control it and where
your conscious mind is out

00:15:00.002 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:84%
of the way and it's just
a subconscious response.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: OK, so I want
to talk about that for a bit

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:90%
because that's the tricky part.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that when
I was introducing you.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.990 align:middle line:84%
When the ego is involved,
when desire is involved,

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.840 align:middle line:84%
when fear is
involved, you're not

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:90%
getting intuitive information.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's say-- I mean, you
teach many, many people how

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
You have a course on life
coaching-- higher guidance life

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
coaching-- which we'll
talk about later.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And you have to help them
come into that resonance.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, those kinds
of fears and desires

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
are endemic to
the human species.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how you
begin that dialog within that

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:84%
can show itself through
the action of the pendulum

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.244 align:middle line:84%
and then, ultimately,
ideally, there's

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
going to come a time we
don't need a pendulum.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.390 align:middle line:84%
We get yes, no, uh uh, yeah,
and we get gradients of that.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.705 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about.

00:15:50.705 --> 00:15:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: When I teach
people how to dowse,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
I tell them to protect
their confidence.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Their confidence, at that
time, is very tender.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
them to do anything

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:90%
that might undermine that.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning, I tell
them they're in training.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So you consciously
move the pendulum.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And you get used to the feel of
what is a yes and what is a no.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we do
some fun exercises.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:84%
One of them is I have a
deck of playing cards.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show them the
backside of the playing card.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I want you to
dowse is this a black card.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's a simple yes or no.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, we just
do five of those.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Once it's finished, I
show them the results.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I have them do is
pay attention to how much

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
their mind gets involved because
the mind wants to be right.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that
happens is the mind says,

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.720 align:middle line:84%
oh, you know, I
think it's black.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And then if you get
three black in a row,

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:84%
the mind says it can't
be another black.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Uh, this
time I'll say no.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:90%
It's red.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wanting them to get
in touch with what that feels

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
like when the mind is
trying to control things.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.894 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Which is
almost 100% of the time.

00:17:04.894 --> 00:17:05.769 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Initially.

00:17:05.769 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes, initially.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Then
what I do is I have

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:90%
them practice the same exercise.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.630 align:middle line:84%
But the point is I tell
them you'll never know.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to
show you the results.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the
conscious mind says,

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:90%
I'll never know?

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's it matter then?

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:84%
And the conscious mind
says, well, no one's ever

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
going to know if I was
right or wrong so--

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Let's just relax
and do this thing, yeah.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: --let's just relax.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I have
them pay attention

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:90%
to what that feels like.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.295 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we want to get to.

00:17:36.295 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And once they can
decipher the difference

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
of when their conscious mind
is trying to control things

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and when it's not--
as soon as they

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:84%
can tell the difference--
then they're ready to dowse.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.037 align:middle line:84%
And if they get to that
they're asking a question

00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden they're
feeling their conscious mind

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:58.216 align:middle line:84%
come in there and say, um, I
want this answer to be yes.

00:17:58.216 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well, I mean, if
you feel an emotional attachment

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:84%
to the outcome, which when
people first start dowsing,

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's like, oh,
is this going to kill me?

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.125 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
picking daisies.

00:18:11.125 --> 00:18:11.625 align:middle line:90%
He loves me.

00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:12.400 align:middle line:90%
He loves me not.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people-- in
the beginning, that's

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.220 align:middle line:84%
how a lot of people
start with dowsing.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So they are not getting,
really, the proper validation

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:90%
because it's bogus.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It is.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest that
they don't do anything

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning that, again,
can be immediately verified

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:84%
because what will happen is
that if they get a wrong answer,

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:84%
then they'll think that
their dowsing doesn't work.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And the tendency is to put
it aside and say, well,

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't work for me.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.521 align:middle line:84%
It's a muscle,
like anything else.

00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:42.770 align:middle line:90%
And you have to strengthen it.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
take very--

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
take precautions to protect
that and your confidence.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:90%
And just get the feeling of it.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.092 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing is
to get that feeling of what

00:18:53.092 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:84%
does it feel like when my
conscious mind is involved?

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:84%
What does it feel
like when it's not?

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
I made the mistake
early on where

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend that
wanted to be pregnant.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And she would call
me every month

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and ask me, OK, did it
work because she was going

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:84%
through all the
methods to make sure

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:90%
that she could get pregnant.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And every month I was
getting no, no, no, you're

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:90%
not pregnant.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I think it was about
the sixth month

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:84%
when she called and she says,
I think this time it worked.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:90%
I really feel good about it!

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:90%
And I so wanted it to be yes.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:90%
And I got a yes.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.167 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't true.

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, so you
got emotionally involved.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: I did.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel the difference.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah, the emotions.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.826 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: They're present.

00:19:36.826 --> 00:19:39.259 align:middle line:84%
You know, actually, it
just occurred to me.

00:19:39.259 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I
didn't say that earlier.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.920 align:middle line:84%
That's when I was first
exposed to dowsing

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.860 align:middle line:90%
when I was in my 20s.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And my ballet teacher, who was
a great mystic, as well-- she

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:90%
was an amazing woman.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:90%
A Russian raised in France.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And she had used dowsing,
gosh, since the 1940s

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:84%
since her children were
little because a radionics

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
professional had
given her this brass.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I still have it as
my main pendulum.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
This old brass pendulum to
determine food allergies.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So one day she was
saying, oh, darling,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:90%
why don't you have children?

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:90%
I said, because I can't.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:84%
I was told by
Stanford University

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:90%
that I will never have children.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.270 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible for
me to have children.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And that had been a really--
a very painful subject for me.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.587 align:middle line:90%
And she said, well, let me see.

00:20:26.587 --> 00:20:27.920 align:middle line:90%
And she pulled out her pendulum.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'd never seen one before.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And she had me pull my top
up so my belly was exposing

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:90%
and unzip my jeans a bit.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.690 align:middle line:84%
She ran it over my belly
and said, nonsense.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I think she said dash.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Whatever that means in Russian.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.715 align:middle line:90%
She said, that's nonsense.

00:20:42.715 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:90%
You can get pregnant.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.520 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So when the time came,
I remembered that.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And I did get pregnant.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I had to work with it a little
bit but only for like a minute.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.925 align:middle line:90%
And then I got pregnant.

00:20:55.925 --> 00:20:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh my
god, that's right.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.902 align:middle line:84%
Madam had told me that
this was possible.

00:21:00.902 --> 00:21:02.610 align:middle line:84%
She was the only one
that could see that.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Stanford University
couldn't see it.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:05.494 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:21:05.494 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: You know?

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And the questions that you
can ask with a pendulum

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:90%
are endless.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a psychic
sitting on your shoulder 24/7.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Any question that you
can think of to ask,

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.120 align:middle line:84%
you can pick up a
pendulum and ask.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And one thing I like
about your particular work that

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:84%
impresses me enough to have you
do this with us is that there

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.536 align:middle line:84%
are protocols that
you've created.

00:21:32.536 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:90%
You share them with people.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But you've created a
vast system of protocols

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
so that even if your emotions
may be a bit involved

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:84%
or if your ego is
a bit involved,

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
you ask a question one way and
you get a particular answer

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:84%
because maybe there's
fear or attachment around,

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
oh god, I hope that's
not the case or whatnot.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:84%
You almost do a cross check
through your protocols

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and teach people the way in
which to ask the question so

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:84%
that, ultimately, you're
guiding yourself past the fears

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and you are asking it in
enough different ways.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:84%
You're almost tricking
that portion of you--

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:84%
your being that is in fear--
that the actual true answer

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
will start arising
from the subconscious.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And how did you, I
mean, I know you're

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:90%
a very diligent, curious person.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:84%
But how did you work such
refined protocols out?

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It's all
in the question.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.300 align:middle line:84%
The accuracy of your
dowsing is determined

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:84%
by the accuracy
of your questions.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So an example might be if
you ask the question, um,

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.460 align:middle line:90%
how willing am I to be a dowser?

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:90%
You might get 100% willing.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask
the question, well,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.555 align:middle line:84%
how willing am I
to dowse in public?

00:22:43.555 --> 00:22:44.287 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:22:44.287 --> 00:22:45.121 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:22:45.121 --> 00:22:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And you
might get, nope.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll do this in the privacy of
my own home but not in public.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So it all depends on the
question that you're asking.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:90%
So you're right.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I ask-- whatever the
subject is, I ask it

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:90%
in a number of different ways.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend of mine call
me about her grandson who

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.120 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be waiting
at the school bus stop

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.820 align:middle line:84%
to be picked up and
he wasn't there.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
So her daughter had called
and then she had called me

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and wanted me to
dowse was the boy OK.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Was he safe?

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:90%
And I dowsed, yes, he was safe.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And was he with somebody
that was friendly?

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Was he within five
miles of the home?

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.800 align:middle line:84%
The one question I didn't
ask was was he already home.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.624 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: OK, there you go.

00:23:39.624 --> 00:23:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it all comes
down to the accuracy

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:90%
of your questions.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And I became very adept at, kind
of, questioning my questions.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.302 align:middle line:84%
If I came up with a question and
then I would take a look at it,

00:23:56.302 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
yeah, but that
could be interpreted

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:90%
a number of different ways.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's rephrase that or
let's find another way

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:90%
to get more accurate.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.835 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, that became my forte.

00:24:06.835 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So dovetailing back
to Hiring The Heavens then,

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:84%
when you're connecting in
with this grid that is you,

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:84%
you also-- now I know
for you personally,

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:84%
you'll be dowsing
but you might also

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
be hearing messages
at the same time.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can use this
in any way you want.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, if I have
time to go into a meditation

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.040 align:middle line:84%
where I can go into the space
and receive information,

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:33.910 align:middle line:90%
I do that.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.105 align:middle line:84%
If I don't have time, then
I pull the pendulum out

00:24:36.105 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and say let's get a quick hit
on this and it'll be accurate.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I just won't go into
as much detail, where

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:84%
you can go into
detail either way.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually
receiving guidance.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:90%
You may be shown pictures.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:84%
You may be hearing
words at the same time.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Is the divination
process opening

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:84%
those channels of
communication for people then?

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: I would
say it's the fastest

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
way to strengthen your
intuition muscles.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:84%
This will-- It starts
out as just, kind of,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:90%
like a fun parlor game.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:07.948 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:25:07.948 --> 00:25:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And very
quickly it moves

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
into opening that door
to your intuition in ways

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.950 align:middle line:90%
that you can't even imagine.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, this
began to connect me

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:90%
with my angels and my guides.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And as I would receive
information from them,

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I would use this
as, kind of, my GPS

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:90%
if I was hearing it correctly.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So for an example, I
might hear information

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that is guiding me in
a certain direction

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:84%
but I'm a little bit
unclear because things

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.380 align:middle line:84%
can be interpreted in
so many different ways.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make sure I've
got the correct interpretation.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I will use this
pendulum to determine, OK,

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:84%
am I understanding
this correctly?

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:90%
How well am I understanding it?

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And I move beyond
the yes/no chart

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and into a percentage chart
where I ask on a percentage.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Have I got the full
understanding of this?

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.250 align:middle line:90%
And if it gives me 100%, great.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.310 align:middle line:84%
If it says, no, you've
only got this 50%,

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
then I start digging and
going more and deeper

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and finding out,
OK, what else do I

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.250 align:middle line:84%
need to know until I
have the fullness of it?

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I use this as a
way to keep me on track

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure that I'm going
in the direction I need to go.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Just a
calibration device, as well.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, a calibration.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's also like playing
21 questions as a kid.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.965 align:middle line:10%
You know, we used
to play that a lot.

00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:10%
You think of a person,
place, or a thing.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin
to ask questions.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can only get a
yes or a no in response.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.320 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if the
animal that you're thinking of

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
is an alligator and the person
asks does it live on the land?

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can't really say yes.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:90%
You can't really say no.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:90%
You're stuck.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So what I needed to do was
develop other charts that

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:84%
went beyond the yes
and no and to give me

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.376 align:middle line:84%
information that
answers these more--

00:27:01.376 --> 00:27:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: More
subtle questions

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that gives you, kind
of, a gradient, a scale.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
But this makes
sense because if you

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.300 align:middle line:84%
have trained your
being and your body

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:84%
to receive information via the
use of this particular tool

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:84%
to go into the difference of
knowing when ego, fear, and so

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.720 align:middle line:84%
forth is involved and
you've learned to quiet

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.990 align:middle line:84%
that, then that's already
the idealized state

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.792 align:middle line:84%
to be receiving other
information, as well.

00:27:26.792 --> 00:27:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It is.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.916 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH:
Additional information

00:27:28.916 --> 00:27:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and through whatever modality
you particularly-- you receive.

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: After a while,
the conscious mind almost

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:90%
becomes like a third person.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And what I tell people is to
allow it to have its opinion.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So an example would be
you're dowsing a question.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.860 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind-- allow
it to have its opinion

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, I think the
answer going to be yes.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:90%
And then say, but I'm curious.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
What does the pendulum say so
that it allows the subconscious

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:90%
now to respond.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.563 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, so
you're not creating

00:27:59.563 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:84%
the conflict between
the conscious

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and the subconscious
because the conscious mind

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:84%
will always want
to be in control.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: It always
wants to have its opinion.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: See, that's what
I love about your work is

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:84%
you find these tricky
little means of bypassing

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.400 align:middle line:84%
what would normally be
challenges so you can get

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
really, kind of,
pure information.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, and
we'll talk about some

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:84%
of this in a little bit,
it's endless as to what you

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:84%
can inquire about and what
you can calibrate, as well.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think it would be good
to take a look at doing,

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.090 align:middle line:90%
kind of, a live demonstration.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
You just did it a
little bit but look

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:90%
at how you use these tools.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And also, you call them--
I thought they were L rods,

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Y rods, whatever.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:90%
The rods.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, the rods.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, the typical
tool for dowsing

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and the one that fits in your
pocket nicely is a pendulum.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.500 align:middle line:90%
The go to anywhere.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:84%
You can use this
wherever you go.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:84%
In stores to find
the best fruit.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
To get a quick answer,
as you were saying.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.770 align:middle line:90%
It's very convenient.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is the best
for chart dowsing.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But some people, especially
when they're working outside,

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.970 align:middle line:90%
they like to use these L rods.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:01.090 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Those are
kind of common for people

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:84%
looking for water
and such it seems.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: You're right.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.818 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:29:04.818 --> 00:29:06.740 align:middle line:90%
These are L rods.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Y rods actually look like a y.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And these are great
for pointing direction.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I used these for the first
time to find our septic tank

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.127 align:middle line:84%
when we moved on
to our property.

00:29:17.127 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Perfect.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Seriously,
I did not know

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that we had to
pump septic tanks.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So I used these
to put an outline

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:30.680 align:middle line:84%
on top of the surface of exactly
where our septic tank was.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I used them to
find out how deep it was.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.332 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked my
husband to start digging.

00:29:36.332 --> 00:29:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: And it was there.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Right there.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So when people are
looking for land, for example,

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:84%
or homes, these are really
beneficial to have on you.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.505 align:middle line:84%
You may say, oh my
god, it's so beautiful.

00:29:51.505 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:84%
It's in just the neighborhood
I like and so forth.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But there may be
something deeply impacted

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in the quality of the
energy of that house.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.260 align:middle line:84%
It could have ley lines that
are disadvantageous underneath

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:84%
or some other problem upcoming
that no one can see yet

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's just about
to happen, right?

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about that situation.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, you're house shopping.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.220 align:middle line:84%
You're taking your
pendulum with you.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:84%
You got your pendulum
in your pocket.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.498 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Definitely
these are the times

00:30:17.498 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:84%
that you want to have
a number of questions

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:84%
all thought out ahead of time
because in the moment you often

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.760 align:middle line:84%
forget about the most
important things to ask, right?

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So I would suggest that
they sit down ahead of time

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.220 align:middle line:90%
and write out the questions.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And I even go so far
as to tell or write

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:39.650 align:middle line:84%
the criteria of the home
that I'm looking for.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:90%
It must have four bedrooms.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It must have a great energy.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It must have a pool.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:90%
It must have this or that.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
shopping for homes,

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:54.060 align:middle line:84%
have the pendulum only
show you those homes

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.205 align:middle line:90%
that fit that criteria.

00:30:55.205 --> 00:30:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So when you
have-- in other words, when

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.510 align:middle line:84%
you have a list of addresses
before you or whatnot,

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:90%
you only go with those.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, OK.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can narrow
that down logically.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Now you have all these
homes with this criteria.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Some
of them you can't

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:84%
narrow down logically
because they won't tell you

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:84%
about what the energy
is of the home.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: No, yeah.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So then-- then, once
you get to the property,

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.015 align:middle line:84%
then you want to have
a list of questions

00:31:21.015 --> 00:31:23.600 align:middle line:84%
that-- to ask
about the property.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.140 align:middle line:84%
You want to know about the
electromagnetic fields.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.890 align:middle line:84%
You want to know about,
um, the neighbors.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:84%
What kind of neighbors
are you going to have?

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.990 align:middle line:84%
How compatible you are going
to be with the neighbors.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you want to find out--
I live out in the country.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:84%
What kind of wildlife
is there that

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:84%
may interfere with
your ability to have

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.940 align:middle line:84%
domesticated animals,
that sort of thing.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So once you have your questions,
then go through your--

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and use your
pendulum to find out

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.980 align:middle line:84%
if this home now
fits those questions.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And I also would
use it not on a yes

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and no but I would advance
to a percentage chart.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: OK, so you have a
piece of paper and a big fatty

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.281 align:middle line:90%
pen there.

00:32:07.281 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what that looks

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.988 align:middle line:84%
like because now you're
talking about shades of gray.

00:32:10.988 --> 00:32:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And most questions do fall
into those shades of gray.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.950 align:middle line:84%
But let's start with
the basic yes and no.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.290 align:middle line:90%
And this is the first training.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:24.060 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
draw a half circle.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.787 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be your yes.

00:32:25.787 --> 00:32:27.120 align:middle line:90%
And this is going to be your no.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And you can
maybe just hold it up

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:29.993 align:middle line:84%
for the camera right
where it is there

00:32:29.993 --> 00:32:31.510 align:middle line:90%
so they can take a look at it.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.627 align:middle line:84%
It's really simple, but just
kind of stay with us on that.

00:32:34.627 --> 00:32:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Really simple.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So you got a yes and a no
and the shades in between.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Then, this is how
you begin to train your muscle.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:90%
And get used to that feeling.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning, you're
going to make it go to yes.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And then make it go
counterclockwise to no

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:90%
and then clockwise back to yes.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And again, if it's-- don't
wait for the pendulum to do it

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.081 align:middle line:90%
Make the pendulum do it.

00:32:59.081 --> 00:33:00.621 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: In the
beginning, make it

00:33:00.621 --> 00:33:02.180 align:middle line:90%
because it does become natural.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yes, you're
training this muscle.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people say,
well, my pendulum's not

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.330 align:middle line:90%
doing anything.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.320 align:middle line:90%
And I say, make it do something.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.910 align:middle line:84%
You're training
your pendulum just

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.830 align:middle line:84%
like when you're learning
to play the piano.

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You can't just put
your hands there

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and expect the
keys to be pressed.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to make your
fingers press the keys.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Once you have this down and when
you are asking your mind give

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.820 align:middle line:84%
me a yes, give me a no,
and all of a sudden you're

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.290 align:middle line:84%
feeling the pendulum doing
it on its own, you're ready.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:90%
You're ready to advance.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:38.330 align:middle line:84%
The next chart is
the percentage chart.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And once you draw this, this
is going to be in your head.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't need this
chart in front of you.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.700 align:middle line:84%
You can just do it
inside your head.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Up at the top will be 50%,
100% over here, and 0%.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:90%
And then the degrees of that.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: You can just briefly
hold that so we can see it.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody gets
it but just-- yeah, OK.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.280 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So if I was
using the yes/no chart

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and I asked a simple
yes/no question

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and that's the only
response I'm going

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:18.610 align:middle line:84%
to give my higher guidance to
respond to and I say is my hair

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:23.420 align:middle line:84%
dye harmful to my health,
what does it have to answer?

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:28.199 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just that much
harmful, it has to say yes.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, by using a
percentage chart,

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.719 align:middle line:84%
I can ask how harmful is
my hair dye to my health.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: OK.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.505 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: All right?

00:34:37.505 --> 00:34:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, it might
come up it's only 5%.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, my vanity is worth it.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Mm hm.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:42.468 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:34:42.468 --> 00:34:44.592 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: But if
it's 100%, then I

00:34:44.592 --> 00:34:46.300 align:middle line:84%
got to go looking for
different hair dye.

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.449 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So that's
why this is so much more

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:51.940 align:middle line:90%
valuable than a simple yes/no.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.449 align:middle line:84%
If I were to ask the
question-- again,

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:56.330 align:middle line:84%
this comes back to it's
all in the question--

00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:00.290 align:middle line:84%
does my body need vitamin C,
what does it have to answer?

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:01.370 align:middle line:90%
It has to answer yes.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.328 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Of course it does.

00:35:03.328 --> 00:35:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So
now, let's do that.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Ask your body to
what degree it needs

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.240 align:middle line:84%
vitamin C, and let's
watch how this works.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Well, OK.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So now I have to ask
the question differently

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:16.130 align:middle line:84%
because the question is does my
body need vitamin C. Everybody

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.080 align:middle line:90%
needs vitamin C.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So the
answer's, duh, yes.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to
get more specific.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And we say, at this
time, how beneficial

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:31.730 align:middle line:84%
would extra supplementation
of vitamin C be for my body

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:32.590 align:middle line:90%
at this time?

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I check,
I'm only about right here.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.337 align:middle line:84%
So no, I don't need
a lot of vitamin C.

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So it looked like
you just went right there.

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:43.060 align:middle line:90%
So what actually happened there?

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: So because I have--
I'll do it in slow motion then.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.090 align:middle line:84%
My pendulum will
start out in this

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.110 align:middle line:90%
what I call ready for question.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And then it will begin
to turn either this way

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.580 align:middle line:90%
or that way on the chart.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.836 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell by the
direction that it's swinging.

00:36:02.836 --> 00:36:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: You
can feel it, too.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.501 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, I can feel it.

00:36:05.501 --> 00:36:09.235 align:middle line:84%
And then it just flat-lines
there or stays there.

00:36:09.235 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Because
you're so adept at it,

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.350 align:middle line:84%
it looks like you just
go, oh, there it is.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen you
dowse before now

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.034 align:middle line:84%
talking about
removing the chart.

00:36:18.034 --> 00:36:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Once you have a
chart in your head

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.740 align:middle line:84%
or once you have a notion
of percentages in your head,

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.740 align:middle line:90%
again, it's that intention.

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Then I've seen you
before go through and say

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.887 align:middle line:90%
is that 10 or-- OK, there it is.

00:36:28.887 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
happened like that.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.546 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening silently,
most of the time, with you.

00:36:33.546 --> 00:36:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So someone-- a client of
yours-- will be asking you

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.610 align:middle line:84%
a question, for example,
and it's just automatic.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:84%
[MUMBLES] OK, you
need 40% on that one,

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.950 align:middle line:84%
yeah, is how it's impacting you
to that degree and so forth.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So again, there's a progression
through all of this.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about connecting
with the guidance realm.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.109 align:middle line:84%
How do you know whether you're
connecting with your guides

00:36:59.109 --> 00:37:01.400 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're connecting
with your own subconscious

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.950 align:middle line:84%
or your own higher self,
which is as good as connecting

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.500 align:middle line:84%
with any guide, you
know, for the most part.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: The answer that
you're going to receive

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:84%
is actually going to be filtered
through your subconscious.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And your subconscious
will either

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:18.580 align:middle line:84%
answer it, if it knows, or go
to your higher consciousness

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.300 align:middle line:84%
or to the super consciousness
to get the answer.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And then it's filtered on
back through the subconscious,

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.680 align:middle line:90%
which moves the muscle here.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And the conscious mind
cannot go there directly.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.160 align:middle line:84%
You can only get to it
from the subconscious.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So when you are dowsing
and asking the question,

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.920 align:middle line:84%
again, envision the
conscious mind as an observer

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.830 align:middle line:84%
off to the side and curious
about what the pendulum is

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:51.120 align:middle line:84%
going to retrieve, and
respond, and give you back

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.140 align:middle line:90%
as information.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The responses back
can sometimes be

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.296 align:middle line:84%
so different than
what you expected.

00:37:59.296 --> 00:38:01.920 align:middle line:84%
That's one way you know it's not
your conscious mind giving you

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.380 align:middle line:90%
the information.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: But also
it can be so strong.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.530 align:middle line:84%
It can be a visceral
feeling because it's

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.220 align:middle line:90%
being brought through your body.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.240 align:middle line:84%
You are the instrument,
and the information

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.270 align:middle line:90%
is coming through you.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And the information can be so--
it can give you just the chills

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.610 align:middle line:90%
when you're-- oh, my god.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.435 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes the pendulum
begins to swing so--

00:38:23.435 --> 00:38:24.185 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Crazy.

00:38:24.185 --> 00:38:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: --go crazy that
you're going to hurt somebody,

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:26.979 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:38:26.979 --> 00:38:29.386 align:middle line:84%
Or it's going to go
flying off into the room.

00:38:29.386 --> 00:38:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's because your--
the response is communicating

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.810 align:middle line:84%
to this muscle in the
arm and it is so spot on.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's trying
to tell you that.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets to that place
where your conscious mind is

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.020 align:middle line:84%
just observing
what's happening, you

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:84%
can pick up all sorts of
information and nuances

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.380 align:middle line:84%
that are beyond what you're
seeing with the pendulum.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.374 align:middle line:84%
You are picking up that
this is important here.

00:38:58.374 --> 00:39:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: This is
really, really, important.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah, lets
pay attention to this.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.770 align:middle line:84%
We are going in the
right direction.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Or no, no, no, no.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.160 align:middle line:84%
This is going in
the wrong direction.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.720 align:middle line:90%
We're getting very cold now.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
really fun about it.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And you
develop your own rapport.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.337 align:middle line:90%
And it develops.

00:39:16.337 --> 00:39:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And you teach people a
certain way to do it.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.800 align:middle line:90%
And they do it that way.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.049 align:middle line:90%
And it could change over time.

00:39:20.049 --> 00:39:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed with
myself it went

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.330 align:middle line:84%
from very strong yes
and no clear patterns

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to finally it just-- I
don't know what happened.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.530 align:middle line:84%
It just got lazy and
it just wouldn't move.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Want a no?

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Dead.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Not moving for you.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.580 align:middle line:90%
No energy there.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And then it became a
gradient to where it almost

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.370 align:middle line:84%
swings like a swing when
you're swinging too high

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and the ropes go slack
and it's gone, you know,

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:43.320 align:middle line:90%
beyond its full momentum.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So I just use it that way
now in little gradients.

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:46.612 align:middle line:90%
Like, a little bit.

00:39:46.612 --> 00:39:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, that's pretty good.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, absolutely or
no energy whatsoever.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And it just, kind of,
seemed to transform

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.520 align:middle line:84%
itself that way for
whatever reason.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like there's
a right or wrong way.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.590 align:middle line:84%
You'll develop your
own rapport with it.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: You will.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.247 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to move
on to chart dowsing--

00:40:05.247 --> 00:40:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: They're interesting.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Yeah,
they are because you

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.300 align:middle line:84%
can have a whole
list of emotions.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.260 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to find
out what's going on here?

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.820 align:middle line:84%
What's the emotion
that's involved

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.470 align:middle line:90%
with this pain I'm feeling?

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, pull out your
dowsing chart book,

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.390 align:middle line:84%
which would have a list
of 50 different emotions,

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and have your pendulum
point right to it.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:27.066 align:middle line:84%
And you might find out that this
pain has to do with resentment.

00:40:27.066 --> 00:40:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And then, the next
question you could ask

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.020 align:middle line:84%
is, well, now what
do I need to do

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.790 align:middle line:90%
to let go of this resentment?

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Is it forgiveness?

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And your pendulum might
say, no, that's not it.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Is it that I need to address
this situation and confront it?

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So you can use your
pendulum to find out

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.994 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with situations
once you uncover what caused it.

00:40:51.994 --> 00:40:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And there are some pretty
sophisticated charts.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're quite thorough.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:41:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And they cover, kind of, every
different subject in life.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean the American
Dowsers Association--

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I've been to one of their
conferences anyway--

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's pretty
remarkable, once you

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.940 align:middle line:84%
get into the world of
dowsing, the tools that

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.740 align:middle line:90%
are available for you there.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about
using it for, you call it,

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.440 align:middle line:90%
higher guidance life coaching.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was intrigued with
that because normally when

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:24.000 align:middle line:84%
you go to a life coach, you
have a rather limited basket

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.976 align:middle line:84%
of tools, I found, from
the various people I

00:41:26.976 --> 00:41:28.100 align:middle line:90%
know who do life coaching.

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Some are marvelous
people and even intuitive

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:36.740 align:middle line:84%
but they're not getting
the same degree of accuracy

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.340 align:middle line:84%
in looking at your
subconscious programs.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.680 align:middle line:90%
It's more almost like therapy.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.777 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of mind chat.

00:41:41.777 --> 00:41:42.610 align:middle line:90%
What are your goals?

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:43.300 align:middle line:90%
What are you thinking?

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.424 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about that?

00:41:44.424 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you do
that, what do you--

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Where it's really inefficient,
time-wise, compared

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.510 align:middle line:90%
to what it appears you're doing.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Now you have-- I don't know--
hundreds and hundreds of pages

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.636 align:middle line:84%
that you are sharing with people
through a course that goes on.

00:41:58.636 --> 00:41:59.760 align:middle line:90%
How many lessons are there?

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know there are
different levels of it.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:02.285 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: There's
over 60 hours.

00:42:02.285 --> 00:42:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: 60 hours of lessons.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I know that's an online
thing and you do that

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.967 align:middle line:90%
with people privately, too.

00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But talk about the
difference in what you've

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.830 align:middle line:84%
noticed in life coaching
from that perspective, which

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:17.270 align:middle line:84%
was kind of a natural
transition to you from being

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.955 align:middle line:84%
your full time
practice as naturopath

00:42:18.955 --> 00:42:22.145 align:middle line:84%
and to helping people discover
all of this on their own.

00:42:22.145 --> 00:42:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Well, yeah.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:28.020 align:middle line:84%
It was a natural transition
because working with health you

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.500 align:middle line:84%
cannot talk about health unless
you talk about mind, body,

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:30.785 align:middle line:90%
spirit.

00:42:30.785 --> 00:42:31.534 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:42:31.534 --> 00:42:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And so it was
just a natural transition

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and, actually, far
more effective.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, with typical
life coaching,

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:44.300 align:middle line:84%
you're depending on asking the
right questions to the client

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.430 align:middle line:84%
to get them to
respond and give you

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:52.500 align:middle line:84%
the answer that's
right for them.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's a saying that
we all have our own answers.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And I will say that's true
and then that's not true.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.210 align:middle line:84%
If we did have our
own answers, we

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:00.725 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be seeking
a life coach.

00:43:00.725 --> 00:43:01.475 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:43:01.475 --> 00:43:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: What I'm saying
is that we fool ourselves.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.220 align:middle line:84%
We tell ourselves
what we want to hear.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We tell ourselves
convenient stories

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.560 align:middle line:90%
and, oh, that sounds good.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.510 align:middle line:84%
It sounds that I think that
I have a problem with money

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:20.210 align:middle line:84%
because my parents
were poor and that's

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.560 align:middle line:90%
how I learned about money.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm sure that's where
I got that programming.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you tune in to
someone's higher guidance

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and let their higher
guidance be the coach

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and get to the real truth,
their higher guidance

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:40.420 align:middle line:84%
may come back and say, no,
that's not the case at all.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.060 align:middle line:84%
You did not, you
know, get an idea

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.850 align:middle line:90%
about money from your parents.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:48.600 align:middle line:84%
This is actually stemming from
a worthiness issue for yourself.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.814 align:middle line:84%
This actually is stemming
to how you value your own--

00:43:51.814 --> 00:43:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Or
maybe even an event

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.360 align:middle line:84%
that occurred that
created-- a specific event.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: It could be anything.

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:57.355 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

00:43:57.355 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
saying is, as a coach,

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:06.850 align:middle line:84%
how would I know what has
caused someone's blocks?

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:08.500 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.520 align:middle line:84%
But I do know their
higher guidance knows

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.010 align:middle line:84%
because their higher guidance
has had to live with them

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.480 align:middle line:84%
all these years, knows
everything about them

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:84%
down to every event
that has ever occurred,

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:23.830 align:middle line:84%
including their past lives
and including their soul path.

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And so that's who I want to
talk to because this conscious

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.180 align:middle line:84%
person may have told
themselves many things that

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:32.720 align:middle line:90%
just aren't true.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I remember talking to a
client who had-- she, herself,

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:84%
was a life coach and had taken
many life coaching courses.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet, she was having
trouble with her own business.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Not as a life coach but as
a different website business

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.730 align:middle line:90%
that she was trying to develop.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:55.200 align:middle line:84%
She was having
trouble with that.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And so she didn't
want to call me

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.130 align:middle line:84%
because she was, herself, a
life coach and felt like, well,

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.470 align:middle line:84%
why would I call
another life coach?

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:06.190 align:middle line:84%
But this is so different
and this is so unique.

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So when she did finally
call me, the first thing

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:12.270 align:middle line:84%
her higher guidance
said is ask her

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:14.650 align:middle line:84%
why she wants to
do this business.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
she responded back

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.280 align:middle line:84%
with all the things
that sounded good.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to do this business
because it's helping people.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Or I want to do this
business because I

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:26.730 align:middle line:84%
feel like I have this
gift to give to people.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, those are nice things
that we tell ourselves, right?

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.600 align:middle line:90%
But was it the truth?

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And using the
pendulum to confirm

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.350 align:middle line:84%
what I was hearing from her
higher guidance, I said,

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:38.500 align:middle line:90%
that's not it.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Tell me why do you want
to do this business.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden she
just blurted it out.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I want to prove my mother wrong.

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: There you go.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:49.714 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: And until her higher
guidance made her dig for that,

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:58.940 align:middle line:84%
she would have gone with
all of the surface answers.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Once she discovered
her real motivation,

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:05.490 align:middle line:84%
she realized I don't
want to do this business.

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:07.240 align:middle line:84%
That's not what I
want to do and I

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.490 align:middle line:90%
don't want that as a motivation.

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:10.880 align:middle line:90%
And she let it all go.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.155 align:middle line:90%
She let the business go.

00:46:12.155 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even what
she wanted to do.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.404 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: And all of
us have varying degrees

00:46:16.404 --> 00:46:17.070 align:middle line:90%
of some of that.

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Proving something to
ourselves or someone.

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:20.930 align:middle line:90%
And so how does that go?

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you're working
with a group of people

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:84%
who are neophytes when it comes
to using dowsing in particular

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing them together
in this life coaching situation

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I would imagine--
first of all, I

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:36.010 align:middle line:84%
have to say I can totally
understand the value

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and popularity of life
coaching in these times.

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:39.780 align:middle line:90%
People are switching careers.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.480 align:middle line:84%
The economy has changed,
giving us a new opportunity

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.770 align:middle line:84%
to spread our wings,
forcing us to have

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.830 align:middle line:84%
to look for other avenues of
how we're going to make a living

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and how we're going
to live and so forth.

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:53.312 align:middle line:84%
So life coaching is a big deal,
but you want it to be accurate.

00:46:53.312 --> 00:46:54.770 align:middle line:84%
But I would think
when these people

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:56.540 align:middle line:84%
are going through
the training they're

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.790 align:middle line:84%
having to put themselves
through all of this, as well.

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.740 align:middle line:84%
First, their feet
are to the fire.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they work on
themselves first.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:05.450 align:middle line:90%
They work on each other.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And they experience what it
feels like to get to the truth.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.810 align:middle line:90%
And that is interesting.

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I had that experience
when I went

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.050 align:middle line:84%
to a very well known
financial conference.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And one of the programs
that he handed out--

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.010 align:middle line:84%
or sheets of-- or
surveys he handed out

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:27.080 align:middle line:84%
was a list of all sorts of
negative beliefs about money.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And you were to rate on
a scale of zero to 10

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.260 align:middle line:90%
how strongly you believe that.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, a belief that money
doesn't grow on trees or you

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.370 align:middle line:90%
have to work hard to have money.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Those types of things.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I went
through them I said,

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:44.640 align:middle line:84%
zero, zero, zero, maybe
one, zero, zero, zero and I

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.380 align:middle line:90%
thought, OK, really?

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.140 align:middle line:90%
Seriously?

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So later on in my hotel
room, I took my pendulum

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.600 align:middle line:90%
and I asked my higher guidance.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I coach myself with my
own higher guidance.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, is there one
of these that's really a 10

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not willing to tell
myself the truth about it?

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:05.750 align:middle line:90%
There were three of them.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.166 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Well,
and also looking

00:48:07.166 --> 00:48:09.440 align:middle line:84%
at your deep, deep background,
you came from a very,

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.570 align:middle line:84%
kind of a strict,
fundamentalist background

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:14.480 align:middle line:84%
early on that you had to
kind of find your way out of,

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.240 align:middle line:90%
transcend.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But those-- And we've all come
from some kind of tradition

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:21.710 align:middle line:84%
where those messages have
been pounded into us.

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And how often do
you find if you're

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.180 align:middle line:84%
working with people on this
subject of their finances,

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:28.630 align:middle line:84%
for example, that they
have those things embedded

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.400 align:middle line:84%
in them like you
did, like we all do?

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.275 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Yes, yes.

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Everyone?

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much everyone?

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SLATTER: Well, we all
have stuff going on.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
what the subject.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And this-- what's
wonderful about this

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:43.150 align:middle line:84%
is that it's like the
subconscious is a computer

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:44.270 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a-- if
you're having trouble

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:50.330 align:middle line:84%
on your computer or this
program isn't behaving correctly

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and you would take
it to a programmer

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and say why isn't
this working, it's

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.790 align:middle line:84%
not enough for the
programmer to say,

00:48:56.790 --> 00:49:01.080 align:middle line:84%
well, I know it has to do
with this area of the program.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.690 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to fix it.

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:06.400 align:middle line:84%
The programmer has to go in and
find that exact line of code.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's a comma missing.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe this whole line of code
needs to be put someplace else.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.360 align:middle line:84%
They have to go in and
get that specific in order

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.620 align:middle line:90%
to fix the program.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, your subconscious
is often like that.

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:21.270 align:middle line:84%
There can be a program-- a line
of code-- in your subconscious

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that you are responding
to and acting on.

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And with a pendulum, you can
get to that exact line of code

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and shift it and
make corrections.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah,
it's so precise.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So right now, that's
what you're focusing on.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.530 align:middle line:84%
You're focusing on
teaching other people

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:39.780 align:middle line:90%
how to do this for themselves.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And they can start,
then, assisting others.

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, assuming
they're not doing

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.693 align:middle line:90%
it to prove their mothers wrong.

00:49:44.693 --> 00:49:46.282 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:49:46.282 --> 00:49:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Any
final thoughts, Jean?

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.685 align:middle line:84%
I think you've done a lovely job
of explaining the basics of it

00:49:51.685 --> 00:49:52.185 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:49:52.185 --> 00:49:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SLATTER: Great, great.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:50:00.130 align:middle line:10%
I feel that anybody has
the talent to do this now.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:04.150 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people are intimidated
by the idea of intuition

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:06.980 align:middle line:10%
and connecting in
as a psychic would.

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And they feel like, well, I
just don't have that gift.

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can learn to dowse.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:15.401 align:middle line:84%
And when you do this, it
strengthens that intuition

00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:15.900 align:middle line:90%
muscle.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.125 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it, you
will call yourself intuitive.

00:50:19.125 --> 00:50:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Thank
you so much, Jean.

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:22.160 align:middle line:90%
It's such a worthy subject.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.618 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you could
come back and we

00:50:23.618 --> 00:50:25.450 align:middle line:84%
could focus just
on that this time.

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.010 align:middle line:10%

I've given it to
all my girlfriends.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.546 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago, I
think I gave it to everyone

00:50:41.546 --> 00:50:42.164 align:middle line:90%
for Christmas.

00:50:42.164 --> 00:50:43.830 align:middle line:84%

that, you might also
