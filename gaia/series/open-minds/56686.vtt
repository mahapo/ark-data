[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:24.224 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Have you
ever wondered why you were born

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.992 align:middle line:90%
into the family you're part of?

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.929 align:middle line:84%
If you're like a high percentage
of our other Gaiam TV viewers,

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.031 align:middle line:84%
you may even feel that
you're the black sheep,

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.933 align:middle line:84%
with different
thoughts and desires

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.468 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of the clan.

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:37.304 align:middle line:84%
Science has debated the subject
of nature versus nurture

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:38.772 align:middle line:84%
for decades, but
it appears there's

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.975 align:middle line:84%
something far more profound
in fashioning who we are.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.177 align:middle line:84%
We're going to speak
with the group THEO

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:47.113 align:middle line:84%
through channel and teacher,
Sheila Gillette, about DNA,

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.649 align:middle line:90%
soul, and family dynamics today.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.851 align:middle line:90%
And welcome back, Sheila.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.118 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEILA GILLETTE: Hi, Regina.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.587 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to be here.

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:55.789 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you know,
I just wanted-- wrap up--

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.291 align:middle line:84%
just kind of do a little
recap of our last conversation

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:00.494 align:middle line:90%
for people who saw it last week.

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:04.764 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with really
more-- we talked about some

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:09.436 align:middle line:84%
of the anomalous animal species
and creatures on the planet

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:12.839 align:middle line:84%
and then moved on, toward
the end of the conversation,

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:15.876 align:middle line:84%
to something that was much
broader and more profound,

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.745 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with
the planet Earth itself.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:22.482 align:middle line:84%
Because one of my bugs is
that all of these films,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.251 align:middle line:84%
all of these brand
new TV series,

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:26.686 align:middle line:84%
are programming a younger
generation of people

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:30.257 align:middle line:84%
to feel it's the end game--
that it's over, right?

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:31.525 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: Yes.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:34.694 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That we have a
dystopian, apocalyptic future--

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:84%
no grass, no trees, no
resources, no nothing.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.202 align:middle line:84%
And I just get so angry on a
soul level when I see that,

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:46.039 align:middle line:84%
because that's creating a
sense of despair and actually

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:84%
irresponsibility, and that's
not what the THEO group said

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.645 align:middle line:84%
was going to be
happening at all.

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:53.246 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: No, no.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.982 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have a bright future
if we just want to accept it.

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:59.218 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a time
that's just an exquisite time

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:02.422 align:middle line:84%
to be alive because we're
evolving to a higher

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:05.926 align:middle line:84%
conscious state, to the really--
understanding that we are

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:09.529 align:middle line:84%
the masters of our universe,
literally-- that we are

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.967 align:middle line:84%
creation, and that thoughts
are things and what we think,

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.201 align:middle line:90%
we get.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:20.173 align:middle line:84%
And so, what THEO does is
helping us to re-frame the way

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:84%
we think, to
reprogram our brains

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.278 align:middle line:84%
because brains are
constantly growing.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:28.448 align:middle line:84%
And our default
mechanism in our brain,

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:33.486 align:middle line:84%
our neural pathway to default,
is the negative-- is fear.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's been true
since we've become humans

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.059 align:middle line:90%
because it was fright or flight.

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:90%
It meant survival.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.897 align:middle line:84%
Now, we need to be in
the place of creation,

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
at the causal
level of our brain,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.572 align:middle line:84%
recreating new neural pathways
in a positive bent-- shifting

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:57.644 align:middle line:84%
out of the fear base that we've
been in for thousands of years.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:00.413 align:middle line:84%
Now is a time in this fifth
dimensionary energy, which

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:03.984 align:middle line:84%
is the highest energy we've
been in on the planet--

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:07.153 align:middle line:84%
new vibrational frequencies
that never before

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:11.758 align:middle line:84%
have humans been able
to access and accept

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:15.996 align:middle line:84%
that we have-- we
are the creator.

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:17.364 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are things.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.332 align:middle line:90%
We have power.

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:21.167 align:middle line:90%
Things are not done to us.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:25.338 align:middle line:84%
We create those things to
happen to come into our lives

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:26.773 align:middle line:90%
for learning opportunities.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.442 align:middle line:84%
That's all they are--
opportunities of growth.

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.845 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And one of the
things we talked about-- I mean,

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:33.213 align:middle line:90%
we talked about the planet.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.349 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the oceans,
the trees, the forest.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.853 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that they were mentioning

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:42.222 align:middle line:84%
was, well, just
like a human being.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.057 align:middle line:84%
Everyone watching our
shows can pretty much

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.359 align:middle line:84%
accept that humans
have the ability

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.294 align:middle line:84%
to self-heal, even
at the 11th hour,

00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:52.732 align:middle line:84%
from the most dire of
circumstances and diseases.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:57.537 align:middle line:84%
We've seen people who go into
miraculous types of remission

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.072 align:middle line:90%
of all kinds.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.308 align:middle line:84%
But we somehow have been
sold a bill of goods

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:05.045 align:middle line:84%
that the planet has no
ability to also heal

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.447 align:middle line:84%
from the devastation
we've wreaked upon it.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.249 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we've done
some-- we've trashed

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.284 align:middle line:90%
the place, in a lot of cases.

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:14.254 align:middle line:84%
But the planet has
that-- is that same kind

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.956 align:middle line:84%
of self-healing,
self-conscious organism

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.892 align:middle line:84%
that, if you just
stop hitting her,

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:21.061 align:middle line:84%
she can recover just
the same, and will

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.197 align:middle line:84%
recover because our
consciousness, as you say,

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:27.133 align:middle line:84%
is shifting to a higher
plateau of understanding, where

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:30.937 align:middle line:84%
we realize now you can't
just dump stuff in the ocean.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.072 align:middle line:90%
Duh.

00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:35.041 align:middle line:84%
Well, even 30 years ago,
we didn't all accept that.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, we pretty much
are on board with that.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.879 align:middle line:84%
>> GILLETTE: Most everybody
knows that that's necessary

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.082 align:middle line:90%
because of our media.

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:45.585 align:middle line:84%
In an instant, we can see a
cataclysmic event happening--

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.153 align:middle line:90%
an Earthquake happening.

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:50.056 align:middle line:90%
We can see a tsunami happening.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.592 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing time.

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:55.962 align:middle line:84%
Never before have we had that
connectivity to our planet

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:56.896 align:middle line:90%
that we have now.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:58.098 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.632 align:middle line:84%
>> GILLETTE: But, you know,
if you look at a forest

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.836 align:middle line:84%
that's been burnt, that's had
a natural fire which is natural

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:08.875 align:middle line:84%
to it-- let it be a lightning
strike, and the forest burns.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:11.878 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
the next spring?

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:15.081 align:middle line:84%
New little sprouts are
sprouting-- new little tree

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:16.148 align:middle line:90%
sprouts.

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From what
looks like devastation.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.752 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: It is devastation.

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:22.222 align:middle line:84%
But the phoenix rising
out of the ashes,

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:27.761 align:middle line:84%
which fertilize the ground,
comes this new life.

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:30.063 align:middle line:84%
Yosemite is a perfect
example of that.

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:32.365 align:middle line:84%
They had that big
fire several years ago

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:35.135 align:middle line:90%
that devastated Yosemite Park.

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:38.538 align:middle line:84%
And now, you go up there, and
here's all this new growth,

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.607 align:middle line:90%
and it's gorgeous.

00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:46.246 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth does have
that regenerative process

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:50.517 align:middle line:84%
within it-- in its cells, let's
say, just as our bodies do.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:51.718 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And say for clear cutting
the Amazon, the planet's

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:90%
lungs, that's not wise policy.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.062 align:middle line:84%
But at least there are
enough people, and groups,

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:05.265 align:middle line:84%
and governments onto
it that, slowly, we

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:09.068 align:middle line:84%
can start hoping
that that practice is

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:90%
going to be reversed.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.173 align:middle line:84%
So as long as we can
keep the lungs alive,

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:16.009 align:middle line:84%
keep forests intact
as much as we

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.578 align:middle line:84%
can at this stage of the
game, and let them continue

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:22.749 align:middle line:84%
to regenerate, we do not have an
apocalyptic, dystopian future.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.751 align:middle line:84%
And it really
bothers me when we're

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:26.686 align:middle line:84%
being sold that
because it's just

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
being sold to us literally,
again, to create that fear.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.558 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.793 align:middle line:84%
We're more controllable
when we're in fear.

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:35.829 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: Absolutely.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:38.865 align:middle line:84%
And really, the message
is, now, the consciousness

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:41.401 align:middle line:90%
is shifting on this planet now.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.571 align:middle line:84%
We've chosen to be here,
to be a part of that

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.772 align:middle line:90%
and bear witness to it.

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:50.043 align:middle line:84%
We are participants and
facilitators of that change.

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:53.379 align:middle line:84%
It's not being done to
us, unless we allow it.

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:56.082 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can do to us that
which we do not allow.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.249 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That is right.

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:02.989 align:middle line:84%
And the THEO group is very
clear that the disharmony

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:06.726 align:middle line:84%
and the lack of acceptance
of the way business

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:09.062 align:middle line:84%
is being done around
this planet at large,

00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:12.298 align:middle line:84%
whether it's environmental,
whether it's political policy,

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:13.766 align:middle line:84%
the way governments
are structured,

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:16.135 align:middle line:84%
the way the economies
of the world

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:20.173 align:middle line:84%
are structured-- that all of
that is in a state of collapse,

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:25.712 align:middle line:84%
and new birth is occurring each
region, each person at a time,

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.815 align:middle line:84%
and so-- never to lose
heart because, as they say,

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.917 align:middle line:84%
you will have the
new birth of this.

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:35.188 align:middle line:84%
Money will still exist, but
it'll be utilized and managed

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:39.692 align:middle line:84%
as a resource from a much
higher perspective in terms

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:40.793 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:41.694 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: Yes.

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:43.429 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I
wrote my first book,

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:46.733 align:middle line:84%
"The Fifth Dimension," and
this was 20 years ago--

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:84%
well, no, 24 years
ago that it came out.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.538 align:middle line:84%
THEO was talking about
these very things.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:54.974 align:middle line:84%
They've been talking
about it for four decades,

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.975 align:middle line:84%
that this energy would
be here, and these

00:07:56.975 --> 00:07:59.279 align:middle line:84%
are the changes that
would be happening.

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:01.214 align:middle line:84%
And what was
interesting to me is

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:06.119 align:middle line:84%
that they said that because
of the desire of the people,

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:07.787 align:middle line:84%
the changes would
come, and it would

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:10.290 align:middle line:90%
begin in the Baltic states.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:15.461 align:middle line:84%
Well, that book was
published in December of '88.

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:19.766 align:middle line:84%
In 1989, the Berlin
Wall came down,

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:22.769 align:middle line:84%
and the political structures
that were dissolving

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.804 align:middle line:90%
started to change then.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:84%
This has been-- well, they
said it started 100 years ago,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:84%
the fifth dimensionary
energy embracing this planet,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.379 align:middle line:90%
and it would culminated in 2012.

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:37.583 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're fully in it,
and that we're bearing witness

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:42.254 align:middle line:84%
to the things that they spoke
about then-- that there would

00:08:42.254 --> 00:08:45.425 align:middle line:84%
be the need of a global
economic structure.

00:08:45.425 --> 00:08:49.929 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've had the collapse,
a global collapse of economy.

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:54.901 align:middle line:84%
And there is this-- the
global economy meetings

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:58.438 align:middle line:84%
that are happening-- the
power eight or the super eight

00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:01.374 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is
that they meet.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:05.345 align:middle line:84%
And that-- there are changes
necessary because everything

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.113 align:middle line:84%
that happens in
the world happens

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:09.215 align:middle line:90%
to each and every one of us.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.551 align:middle line:84%
And now, we know
with technology.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:17.857 align:middle line:84%
We're being able to touch each
other in such a wonderful way

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:20.526 align:middle line:84%
and see what's happening
around the world.

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:23.029 align:middle line:84%
As these political
structures are

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:26.466 align:middle line:84%
starting to dissolve in
other parts of the world,

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:29.102 align:middle line:84%
here in the United
States, we're seeing

00:09:29.102 --> 00:09:32.071 align:middle line:84%
the upheaval of our
political structure

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:38.277 align:middle line:84%
and the necessary changes that
need to happen for our states

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:44.817 align:middle line:84%
and our country to be viable as
a society in this global world.

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:48.621 align:middle line:84%
And we are a global community,
a common unity of humankind.

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
We're the human
species on this planet.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.058 align:middle line:90%
We have to help each other.

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:53.126 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:55.328 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing a really
kind of-- of course,

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I know I travel in
somewhat rarefied circles

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.966 align:middle line:84%
because I tend to hang out with
people of similar consciousness

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:03.002 align:middle line:84%
to the interviewees
and our Gaiam viewers

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:05.371 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and we're looking
at things from that plane

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:06.539 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:10.276 align:middle line:84%
But from there, I see a
lot of encouraging markers

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.911 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
younger generations,

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.047 align:middle line:84%
too, in terms of
this lack of fear.

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:16.082 align:middle line:84%
It's like, so what
if I can't get

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:18.684 align:middle line:84%
a job that's going to
offer a retirement?

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:19.986 align:middle line:90%
What's retirement?

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:24.023 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I want to make-- well,
there's-- my son and I were

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:28.728 align:middle line:84%
talking about this cool, young,
Dutch fellow who has become

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.663 align:middle line:90%
a knitting guru.

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:32.999 align:middle line:84%
He just likes to knit, and
he's a mathematical genius.

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:36.002 align:middle line:84%
And he's created these
incredible patterns

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:39.338 align:middle line:84%
that women all over the
globe are buying and making

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:42.875 align:middle line:84%
these incredible scarves and
shawls out of these geometrics

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:47.346 align:middle line:84%
that this very flamboyant young
man is creating as his passion.

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.682 align:middle line:84%
His mathematics are being
applied to knitting.

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And I just love it.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.286 align:middle line:84%
When I hear stories like
this, it's like, you go.

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:56.122 align:middle line:84%
>> GILLETTE: Well, you know,
everything's the sacred

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:57.557 align:middle line:90%
geometry.

00:10:57.557 --> 00:11:01.294 align:middle line:90%
Our DNA is a sacred geometry.

00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:03.496 align:middle line:84%
The geometric forms
of our planet,

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.099 align:middle line:84%
of our universe--
so he's tapping

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:09.736 align:middle line:84%
into that in his
creations and letting

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:13.306 align:middle line:84%
us wear that on our
bodies in a vibration

00:11:13.306 --> 00:11:14.607 align:middle line:90%
that we're attracted to.

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.843 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, now, and who
would have said when he was

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:18.878 align:middle line:84%
born-- if you'd said to
his mother, or-- say,

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:21.781 align:middle line:84%
if a soothsayer had
come around and said,

00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.617 align:middle line:84%
"I see your son is going
to be a knitting guru."

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.085 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't believe this.

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:26.752 align:middle line:90%
It's something--

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.722 align:middle line:84%
>> GILLETTE: You mean, he's
not going to be an engineer?

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:31.257 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or a
doctor or a lawyer?

00:11:31.257 --> 00:11:34.026 align:middle line:84%
But again, this lack
of fear in saying,

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:35.561 align:middle line:84%
hey, I want to do
what I want to do.

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:38.264 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring my
particular style of skill,

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:40.399 align:middle line:84%
or talent, or genius
to the planet--

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:44.637 align:middle line:84%
is showing us a lack of
fear about the larger

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:48.608 align:middle line:84%
structures that we, and, say,
our parents' generation were

00:11:48.608 --> 00:11:49.342 align:middle line:90%
facing.

00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:50.476 align:middle line:90%
That's dropping away.

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:51.944 align:middle line:90%
That's very encouraging to me.

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> GILLETTE: Well, those
old forms don't work.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.149 align:middle line:90%
They were too constricted.

00:11:56.149 --> 00:12:01.387 align:middle line:84%
This is a time of advancement
and expansion that's happening.

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.623 align:middle line:84%
And what we're watching
is the old paradigms,

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:06.392 align:middle line:84%
the old thought
processes are dissolving.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.294 align:middle line:90%
They don't work anymore.

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:09.495 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Almost none of it.

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:10.663 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: No.

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, we would
need those structures,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.504 align:middle line:84%
even like the banking
structure, for instance.

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:20.373 align:middle line:90%
Those things need to dissolve.

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:23.342 align:middle line:84%
They were fine for a
certain period of time.

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:26.312 align:middle line:84%
They don't work in the new
energy of this new world

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:29.682 align:middle line:84%
with the connectivity
we have with technology,

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:32.618 align:middle line:84%
with each other, and the
education that we're all

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:33.786 align:middle line:90%
getting.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:36.722 align:middle line:84%
Those old, stayed
ways of being--

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:39.926 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, yeah,
and they became corrupt.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.027 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: They're stuck.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:42.028 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:43.863 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
banking in and of itself

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:45.898 align:middle line:84%
was a bad idea to
begin with, when

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:47.533 align:middle line:84%
it was a community
bank that was there

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:51.604 align:middle line:84%
to help a farmer keep his land
or build a new fence or a home

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.305 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:53.806 align:middle line:90%
It served its purpose.

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:55.775 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what it became.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.743 align:middle line:84%
It became something
entirely different,

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:59.312 align:middle line:84%
with different
financial instruments

00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:90%
that are so beyond corrupt.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.148 align:middle line:90%
They're so creative.

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:04.584 align:middle line:84%
I can't even get
my mind around it.

00:13:04.584 --> 00:13:06.652 align:middle line:90%
And that's what has to dissolve.

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:08.621 align:middle line:84%
Some people found creative
ways to play with it

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.556 align:middle line:84%
and manipulate the
system, so it didn't

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:12.091 align:middle line:84%
work for anyone
but a few anymore.

00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:13.993 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part
that's dissolving.

00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:17.563 align:middle line:84%
>> GILLETTE: Yes, but there
are still those with brilliance

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:19.165 align:middle line:90%
that have the new vision--

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:20.533 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, there are.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>> GILLETTE: --that are coming
forth and creating this new way

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.974 align:middle line:84%
of interchange and
exchange energetically

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
because we'll always have to
have something that's a form

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:84%
of energy exchange
for livelihood.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.481 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sure, and it's the
consciousness behind it that

00:13:36.481 --> 00:13:37.717 align:middle line:90%
has to change.

00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:40.453 align:middle line:84%
And that is, as THEO Group
said-- and I'm aware of just

00:13:40.453 --> 00:13:42.588 align:middle line:84%
from some of my own
connection-- that is happening,

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:43.723 align:middle line:90%
and that is changing.

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:44.991 align:middle line:90%
And I feel very hopeful.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't feel
as though-- I interview

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.563 align:middle line:84%
a wide array of people
with various positions

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:51.831 align:middle line:90%
on everything.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, after
having read, I don't know,

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.237 align:middle line:84%
hundreds, thousands of books
and interviewing several hundred

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:02.208 align:middle line:84%
people, I still come away
an optimist from it all.

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:03.676 align:middle line:84%
>> GILLETTE: Well,
I definitely am.

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:06.812 align:middle line:84%
I think with the
experiences I've had,

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:12.418 align:middle line:84%
and the magical experiences
I've had-- in the sense really

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:16.155 align:middle line:84%
realizing that we have the
ability to move matter.

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to create
in our lives with our thoughts

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.364 align:middle line:84%
the manifestations that we want
with the decision being made.

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:25.865 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.133 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:28.367 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:32.071 align:middle line:90%
Not I wish I could, or I'll try.

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:33.673 align:middle line:90%
That has no energy.

00:14:33.673 --> 00:14:37.476 align:middle line:84%
But once a decision is
made, the universal energy

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:41.781 align:middle line:84%
has something to lock
onto that then begins

00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:46.619 align:middle line:84%
to create that possibility as
we stay current with our energy

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:48.688 align:middle line:90%
and our vision of it.

00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:52.058 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing
time, and we have

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.226 align:middle line:84%
to come out of the
old ways of thinking,

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.996 align:middle line:84%
the old paradigms
that we've been in,

00:14:56.996 --> 00:15:01.467 align:middle line:84%
the old beliefs that are just
as stuck as what we're talking

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:05.171 align:middle line:84%
about as we witness in our
world, because as we are,

00:15:05.171 --> 00:15:06.539 align:middle line:90%
so is our world.

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:08.407 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:12.244 align:middle line:84%
And the THEO Group is--
that's a primary thing.

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.612 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: Yes, it is.

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:16.882 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So, on that note,
this time, this conversation,

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to look at us more
from the perspective of what

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.754 align:middle line:90%
our journey is.

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.956 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
pre-human history,

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:25.057 align:middle line:90%
coming into bodies.

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:26.225 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:29.028 align:middle line:84%
How did some of us land in
certain places and races?

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:31.097 align:middle line:84%
How do we end up jumping
from one to another?

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:84%
What happens when gene
pools mix with souls?

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.502 align:middle line:90%
How attached is the soul to DNA?

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:38.371 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk to
THEO about these things.

00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:39.905 align:middle line:90%
I'm just giving you a heads up.

00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:90%
We're going to talk about--

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.141 align:middle line:84%
>> GILLETTE: That's
exciting conversation.

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:43.242 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:45.511 align:middle line:84%
And what happens to us
between lives and right

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:47.346 align:middle line:84%
when we're leaving our
body, and then coming

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:49.281 align:middle line:90%
into our body as little babies?

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.884 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to
be the nature of it.

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:55.654 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to say we'll
see you a little bit later.

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.823 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't mind
going to THEO now,

00:15:57.823 --> 00:15:59.058 align:middle line:90%
we'll begin that conversation.

00:15:59.058 --> 00:15:59.725 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: OK.

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:00.526 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: See you in a bit.

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:01.761 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: Talk to you later.

00:16:19.044 --> 00:16:20.279 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: It is the beginning.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Is it not?

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.748 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:25.184 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: We are appreciative
of the opportunity to be

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:26.886 align:middle line:90%
of service unto you.

00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:90%
You may ask.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.422 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you, THEO.

00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
This conversation
I'd like to have

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.994 align:middle line:84%
is about the particular
journey of the human being,

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:38.664 align:middle line:84%
the human soul, that goes from
incarnation to incarnation.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:43.369 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to begin
the story with the souls that

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:45.271 align:middle line:84%
occupy the bodies
here on Earth--

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:48.674 align:middle line:84%
which is a wild
collective of beings--

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of that
journey, and how we first

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.613 align:middle line:84%
started taking the bodies that
we recognize as human now,

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.849 align:middle line:84%
and how we made these
decisions to end

00:16:56.849 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:84%
up in different places on the
planet, in different races,

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.054 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:03.588 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just start
at that beginning point

00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:05.658 align:middle line:90%
and move from there.

00:17:05.658 --> 00:17:06.558 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Mm.

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:10.129 align:middle line:84%
No, the soul is
an eternal energy.

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:13.132 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is but one
choice of experience,

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:17.036 align:middle line:84%
and the learning in that
experience is emotions.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:20.439 align:middle line:84%
And a soul choosing to
inhabit a physical structure

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:24.844 align:middle line:84%
on this Earthly plane--
it is not demanded of it.

00:17:24.844 --> 00:17:27.078 align:middle line:90%
It is a choice.

00:17:27.078 --> 00:17:32.885 align:middle line:84%
And so, as a soul observes
what it wishes to learn from,

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:36.856 align:middle line:84%
it chooses a particular
family environment,

00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:41.827 align:middle line:84%
a particular place,
and a particular time

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:44.697 align:middle line:84%
to come into a
physical structure.

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:50.369 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
the very beginning, then,

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:53.339 align:middle line:84%
of souls taking physical bodies
and what that whole period

00:17:53.339 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:84%
of-- long, long period
of history was like,

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.112 align:middle line:84%
when the first
incarnations started.

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:03.349 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you've
said before, this

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:04.884 align:middle line:90%
is a journey of the emotions.

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:08.754 align:middle line:84%
Being on planet Earth is to
learn mastery over emotions.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:12.458 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Yes, and also to learn
emotions, and to master them.

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:15.494 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let's talk about
that part from the beginning.

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:17.463 align:middle line:84%
The souls that originally
came here and were

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:21.166 align:middle line:84%
part of this experiment-- what
was the emotional landscape

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:24.336 align:middle line:84%
like, and what is it
like in many other places

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:84%
on many other star
systems and planets?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.547 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: When embodying a
physical form upon the Earth

00:18:34.547 --> 00:18:38.284 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, depending
upon the particular culture,

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:42.154 align:middle line:84%
for there have been beings
upon this planet for thousands

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:43.422 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:46.258 align:middle line:90%
But you ask in the first.

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:49.094 align:middle line:84%
There was that
which was survival.

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:52.298 align:middle line:84%
Then inhabiting a
physical structure

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:55.901 align:middle line:84%
of third-dimensional
quality, it was a vibration

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:59.471 align:middle line:84%
that was very dense
in and of itself.

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:07.413 align:middle line:84%
So the first souls had the
experience of survival,

00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:13.352 align:middle line:84%
of interacting upon this
Earth with other creatures,

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:16.889 align:middle line:84%
you might say--
inhabitants-- that were not

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:20.859 align:middle line:90%
of human form, that threatened.

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:23.495 align:middle line:84%
There was the environment
within itself.

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So the form had to
metamorphose as well,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:33.172 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of its structure,
and the sense of how it dealt

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:37.142 align:middle line:84%
with the environment, and
the interactions with others

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and how to survive
on the planet itself.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:46.485 align:middle line:84%
So there was a denser energy,
if you would, than there is now.

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:48.821 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And these souls--
let's talk about the source

00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:54.960 align:middle line:84%
or origin of the-- say, the
vast reaches from which various

00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.165 align:middle line:84%
souls may have come for this
experience of learning to know

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:03.702 align:middle line:84%
what it feels like to be
in survival mode, or--

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.372 align:middle line:84%
Learning how to be in
a physical structure,

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:11.343 align:middle line:84%
first and foremost,
energetically speaking.

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:13.312 align:middle line:84%
Know there aren't
just but one choice.

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:16.181 align:middle line:84%
There are billions
of choices for a soul

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:20.352 align:middle line:84%
to experience and learn
from, dimensionally speaking

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:22.321 align:middle line:90%
and universally speaking.

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:26.291 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is a place of
learning of emotions,

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
of interaction, interpersonal
relationships, because you are

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.234 align:middle line:84%
herd animals, so there
were those environments

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:42.975 align:middle line:84%
of compromise and
survival within a group,

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:47.846 align:middle line:84%
and how to work together,
how to feed, how to eat,

00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:51.483 align:middle line:84%
how to shelter--
all of the things

00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:55.988 align:middle line:84%
to learn from in this
particular beginning.

00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:04.897 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The average person
that would be listening to this

00:21:04.897 --> 00:21:06.098 align:middle line:90%
would say, are you kidding?

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:10.102 align:middle line:84%
Why would we have chosen
such a thing, such a density?

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:13.205 align:middle line:84%
What was the intrigue with
taking on physicality?

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: The beauty
of this planet.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.574 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:17.943 align:middle line:84%
That's a good
answer, absolutely.

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, they wanted to have
a physical understanding

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:84%
of this gorgeous,
diverse reality.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.317 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:26.652 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And so, is it unique?

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:28.354 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: The frontiersman,
you might say,

00:21:28.354 --> 00:21:33.559 align:middle line:84%
and women coming forth
in exploratory days,

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:40.432 align:middle line:84%
finding the interaction
satisfactory and exciting--

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:44.603 align:middle line:84%
yes, even with its
difficulties, or its challenges.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are there many other
planets similar to the Earth

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.814 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of landscape,
beauty, diversity?

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:57.783 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: There are
others, yes, as we stated.

00:21:57.783 --> 00:22:00.953 align:middle line:84%
There are billions of planets
that could sustain life.

00:22:00.953 --> 00:22:04.523 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I mean, is
this anomalous in any way,

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:07.726 align:middle line:84%
or is this a reflection of
many other places like this

00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:08.761 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universes?

00:22:08.761 --> 00:22:10.329 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It is a
reflection of others,

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.097 align:middle line:84%
but this has its
particular beauty.

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:13.999 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what is
that particular beauty?

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:17.603 align:middle line:84%
How would you, coming
from non-physical realms,

00:22:17.603 --> 00:22:20.806 align:middle line:84%
characterize the
unique beauty of Earth?

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:25.077 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: The lighting
of your planet,

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:30.048 align:middle line:84%
the flora/fauna of the planet,
the water itself and how it

00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:37.489 align:middle line:84%
forms different valleys, the
topography and its beauty

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:41.293 align:middle line:90%
within that, yes?

00:22:41.293 --> 00:22:42.294 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'm with you.

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:45.164 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big fan of Earth.

00:22:45.164 --> 00:22:49.668 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond words, the beauty
and the creativity that

00:22:49.668 --> 00:22:53.338 align:middle line:90%
expresses itself on this planet.

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:56.008 align:middle line:84%
My family and I were
looking at a bouquet

00:22:56.008 --> 00:22:59.077 align:middle line:84%
of a flower called
peonies the other day.

00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:03.682 align:middle line:84%
And every day, we said, how
can this thing, this flower,

00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:07.619 align:middle line:84%
explode into something more
beautiful than the day before?

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:09.254 align:middle line:84%
And people wonder
whether there's

00:23:09.254 --> 00:23:13.058 align:middle line:84%
intelligence within
the universe.

00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.159 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: There is.

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:14.827 align:middle line:90%
Is there not?

00:23:14.827 --> 00:23:16.862 align:middle line:90%
It is shown in your nature.

00:23:16.862 --> 00:23:18.197 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:23:18.197 --> 00:23:20.065 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just the beauty of
the planet itself, certainly,

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.701 align:middle line:84%
would exemplify the fact that
there is intelligence guiding

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:23.502 align:middle line:90%
creation.

00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:24.736 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:27.005 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And how do you
describe that intelligent that

00:23:27.005 --> 00:23:29.708 align:middle line:84%
would be guiding this
creation of Earth?

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:33.512 align:middle line:84%
How are planets--
what is the mechanism

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
for the creation of planets,
especially planets with-- well,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.986 align:middle line:84%
this planet in particular--
this kind of diversity,

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:42.788 align:middle line:90%
this kind of beauty?

00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: There is within
that-- there's an intelligence,

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:49.895 align:middle line:84%
as you speak about, that
is constantly creating.

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:54.166 align:middle line:84%
And there is a particular
form of structure.

00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:58.503 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are you talking
mathematics, geometry,

00:23:58.503 --> 00:24:01.139 align:middle line:84%
and basic building
blocks of the universe?

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:06.311 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Yes, that then align in
a particular way to bring forth

00:24:06.311 --> 00:24:12.885 align:middle line:84%
structure, of which you
are all a part, yes.

00:24:12.885 --> 00:24:15.954 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So would you say that
the Earth is more-- as you say,

00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:19.224 align:middle line:84%
our reality is the
compilation of our thoughts.

00:24:19.224 --> 00:24:20.792 align:middle line:90%
It's our creation.

00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:24.429 align:middle line:84%
Is the Earth its own
creation and not necessarily

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:27.733 align:middle line:84%
at the hand of an
external creative force?

00:24:27.733 --> 00:24:34.706 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: In that sense, it
was created in an explosion

00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:37.175 align:middle line:90%
of a larger source.

00:24:37.175 --> 00:24:41.914 align:middle line:84%
However, it had to sustain
creativity in and of itself,

00:24:41.914 --> 00:24:46.852 align:middle line:84%
for each cell has a great--
the cold creation within it,

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:51.156 align:middle line:90%
you see, just as your body does.

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.425 align:middle line:90%
The Earth does as well.

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:54.826 align:middle line:90%
It is living.

00:24:57.529 --> 00:25:00.899 align:middle line:84%
It's a living
organism, if you would.

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:02.734 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With it
sounds-- it looks like,

00:25:02.734 --> 00:25:05.570 align:middle line:84%
it appears to be endless
creative possibility.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.272 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes, but so are you.

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:08.941 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:25:08.941 --> 00:25:12.077 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Each thing upon it
has its own endless source

00:25:12.077 --> 00:25:12.678 align:middle line:90%
of creativity.

00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:17.983 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so,
going back to the souls.

00:25:17.983 --> 00:25:20.619 align:middle line:84%
These souls that
I assume have come

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:24.823 align:middle line:84%
from far reaches, that
wanted to involve themselves

00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:27.726 align:middle line:90%
in this experience here?

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:28.694 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:30.195 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Then
we're in physicality,

00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and there were many options as
time went on around the planet,

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.936 align:middle line:84%
each area giving a
different experience,

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:40.605 align:middle line:84%
even so far as to say
maybe different emotional

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:41.106 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:25:44.476 --> 00:25:47.813 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the different
places and races on the planet,

00:25:47.813 --> 00:25:50.582 align:middle line:84%
were they maybe a
little more like-minded

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:53.952 align:middle line:84%
souls that wanted to have
a particular type of, say,

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:57.756 align:middle line:84%
emotional/mental experience
together that would incarnate

00:25:57.756 --> 00:26:02.094 align:middle line:84%
into specific regions, where
others before them had gone,

00:26:02.094 --> 00:26:04.062 align:middle line:84%
maybe some from wherever
they'd come from?

00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:06.565 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: There are groups that
incarnate together to support

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:09.368 align:middle line:84%
each other's growth,
yes, that is so.

00:26:09.368 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And did this
happen in larger systems

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.673 align:middle line:90%
in the peopling of the planet?

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:16.341 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: It did.

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:19.511 align:middle line:84%
But then, as it grew, then
there was the exchange

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:23.715 align:middle line:84%
of just the human
species upon this planet,

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:27.085 align:middle line:84%
engaging in particular
learning experiences

00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:30.622 align:middle line:84%
throughout your world,
and these groups,

00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:33.392 align:middle line:84%
as it were, incarnating
in different areas,

00:26:33.392 --> 00:26:36.194 align:middle line:84%
in different times,
for the experiences

00:26:36.194 --> 00:26:42.701 align:middle line:84%
that they preferred to have,
whatever that might have been,

00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:45.637 align:middle line:90%
culturally.

00:26:45.637 --> 00:26:47.639 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:48.473 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:51.343 align:middle line:84%
And so then, when
we start looking

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:56.882 align:middle line:84%
at the patterns
of reincarnation,

00:26:56.882 --> 00:27:01.820 align:middle line:84%
what is the relationship between
the soul and then the DNA?

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:09.828 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: The DNA of the soul
has a particular structure

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:13.465 align:middle line:84%
in and of itself that therein
would choose a particular

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:17.402 align:middle line:84%
structure and a physicality to
match whatever the learning it

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:20.372 align:middle line:90%
desired to have.

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:22.808 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
those, as we've

00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:25.343 align:middle line:84%
stated, of groups
incarnating together

00:27:25.343 --> 00:27:30.082 align:middle line:84%
to support each other's growth,
however that expresses itself.

00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:34.319 align:middle line:84%
So the choosing of the
environment, the structure

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:38.256 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA, as it were,
would be expressed

00:27:38.256 --> 00:27:42.127 align:middle line:84%
with that in the
sense of physicality,

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:46.431 align:middle line:84%
and the soul choosing a
particular environment

00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:52.237 align:middle line:84%
for its highest learning
or its teaching of others.

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:55.774 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we talked about--
when I introduced Sheila

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:59.945 align:middle line:84%
and you in this segment--
about the phenomena of people--

00:27:59.945 --> 00:28:03.281 align:middle line:84%
we call them black
sheeps-- black sheep.

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:04.716 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
watching this show

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:06.985 align:middle line:84%
are probably considered black
sheep because their thoughts

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:09.287 align:middle line:84%
and ideas are different than
what they were raised with

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:11.123 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps the rest
of their family.

00:28:11.123 --> 00:28:14.593 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you have
the experience of feeling

00:28:14.593 --> 00:28:17.696 align:middle line:84%
absolutely no
familiarity or connection

00:28:17.696 --> 00:28:23.401 align:middle line:84%
to your family or
your tribe at all?

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:27.105 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: There are those who
come as leaders or teachers

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:30.275 align:middle line:84%
in that sense of
that environment,

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:36.481 align:middle line:84%
and the structure therein
chosen offer them an opportunity

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:39.985 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen and grow
from, and to have compassion

00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:42.988 align:middle line:90%
for the human condition.

00:28:42.988 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And many whom you
were speak to, who

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:49.327 align:middle line:84%
have that feeling
of not belonging,

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:53.565 align:middle line:84%
not on the same
frequency of-- they

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:59.004 align:middle line:84%
do have some connectivity for
their own learning within that

00:28:59.004 --> 00:29:03.341 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge the
aspect of themselves that

00:29:03.341 --> 00:29:07.812 align:middle line:84%
have come as the way
shower, as the opportunity

00:29:07.812 --> 00:29:11.183 align:middle line:90%
to share with others.

00:29:11.183 --> 00:29:14.019 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So oftentimes,
this would be a first-time

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:17.189 align:middle line:84%
experience within that soul
group, or tribe, so to speak.

00:29:17.189 --> 00:29:20.625 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: It could be, yes.

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:23.762 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so that would
be the sense of aloneness,

00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
coming with different
thoughts, different ideas.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:29.267 align:middle line:84%
Or being-- and many people,
as a lot of our viewers

00:29:29.267 --> 00:29:31.069 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
people I interview,

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:34.039 align:middle line:84%
have spent their entire life
asking different questions

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:36.474 align:middle line:84%
than what society at
large has to offer.

00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:41.813 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Yes, and showing a
new way of thought as well--

00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:44.749 align:middle line:84%
not always a
comfortable place to be.

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:45.951 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:47.652 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anyone
likes being referred

00:29:47.652 --> 00:29:49.154 align:middle line:84%
to as a black sheep,
although now, I

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:51.223 align:middle line:84%
think it's becoming more
of a badge of honor.

00:29:51.223 --> 00:29:52.924 align:middle line:84%
It just means not
buying in so much

00:29:52.924 --> 00:29:55.727 align:middle line:84%
to an old paradigm or
an old way of thinking.

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:56.528 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:57.562 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:57.562 --> 00:30:02.067 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you look
at the great masters

00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:05.437 align:middle line:84%
that we know about
in our religions,

00:30:05.437 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:84%
even perhaps in our
mythology and such,

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.775 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
Egyptology, or whether it's

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:13.912 align:middle line:84%
great religious leaders--
do these beings,

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:17.482 align:middle line:84%
upon occasion, incarnate
into also physical reality?

00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:21.419 align:middle line:84%
And when there's, say, a
great groundswell of change

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.854 align:middle line:90%
that's about to occur?

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:28.193 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Yes, they do, as
leaders and way showers.

00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:29.361 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:29.361 --> 00:30:33.732 align:middle line:84%
Those who have been
prophets, you might say,

00:30:33.732 --> 00:30:36.301 align:middle line:84%
and speaking of
what was to come,

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:40.105 align:middle line:84%
in the leading of the masses,
the changing of the paradigms

00:30:40.105 --> 00:30:44.342 align:middle line:84%
of thought, the evolution
of consciousness--

00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:46.578 align:middle line:90%
there have been those over time.

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:53.685 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Who would you
say would be among some

00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:56.888 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest way-showers
of our most recent,

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:58.423 align:middle line:90%
modern history?

00:30:58.423 --> 00:30:59.758 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Of your modern history?

00:30:59.758 --> 00:31:01.293 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Modern history, now.

00:31:01.293 --> 00:31:02.927 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: There have been many.

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:05.730 align:middle line:90%
There have been Yogananda.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.966 align:middle line:90%
There has been Gandhi.

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:11.336 align:middle line:84%
There have been other
leaders in your world

00:31:11.336 --> 00:31:13.438 align:middle line:90%
to show the way of new thought.

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:15.340 align:middle line:84%
There have been leaders
of the past that

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.176 align:middle line:84%
have been spoken
of fondly, saying

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:22.280 align:middle line:84%
they were the only
one-- the master Jesus,

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.385 align:middle line:84%
Buddha-- having a great message
for the planet of change,

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:31.389 align:middle line:84%
the Dalai Lama
being of this time.

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:35.927 align:middle line:84%
But there have always been
those speakers of truth,

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:41.333 align:middle line:84%
some misconstrued by others
in the sense of control.

00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:45.337 align:middle line:84%
But there is that creation
of expansion of awareness

00:31:45.337 --> 00:31:46.938 align:middle line:90%
that is a continuum.

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:49.908 align:middle line:90%
It has not stopped.

00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:53.244 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I would like to
ask you about another family

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:57.015 align:middle line:84%
of modern history
because in America,

00:31:57.015 --> 00:31:58.550 align:middle line:84%
among many of the
people I interview,

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.087 align:middle line:84%
it's often thought that with the
killing off of this particular

00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:05.357 align:middle line:84%
person, that's when our paradigm
shifted toward something

00:32:05.357 --> 00:32:06.858 align:middle line:90%
a little darker.

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:12.197 align:middle line:84%
And that was the Kennedy clan,
starting with John F. Kennedy,

00:32:12.197 --> 00:32:14.165 align:middle line:84%
and then going on from
there-- his brother that

00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:15.333 align:middle line:90%
was then assassinated.

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:16.935 align:middle line:84%
His son went down
in a plane crash.

00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:20.238 align:middle line:84%
And they've had a
great deal of tragedy.

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:24.075 align:middle line:84%
But the feeling at the time
when John F. Kennedy was alive

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:26.878 align:middle line:84%
and in the office of
Presidency of the United States

00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:28.747 align:middle line:90%
was a feeling of hope.

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:34.285 align:middle line:84%
I think his favorite
musical was Camelot,

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:39.557 align:middle line:84%
and they were often referred
to as this beautiful couple

00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:44.329 align:middle line:84%
from Camelot, which is a
place of hope and goodness.

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:46.231 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:32:46.231 --> 00:32:50.034 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: There was a great
time of change of consciousness

00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:53.738 align:middle line:84%
in that period of time,
a heightened awareness

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:58.543 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that had
already begun in the first

00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:00.712 align:middle line:90%
of your century.

00:33:00.712 --> 00:33:04.182 align:middle line:84%
Later in the century,
mid-century, it

00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:08.586 align:middle line:84%
actualized in those
things that were changing

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:13.024 align:middle line:84%
to now the fifth dimensionary
energy, aligning with it,

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:17.195 align:middle line:84%
which was awareness,
consciousness, yes?

00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:19.297 align:middle line:84%
And there were those
that spoke out,

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:24.402 align:middle line:84%
that heard the message of
change, that were not satisfied

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:29.040 align:middle line:84%
with the status quo and
could not be manipulated.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.011 align:middle line:90%
And that is continuum until now.

00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:36.514 align:middle line:84%
That movement is
continuing and will

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
continue to expand as beings'
consciousness expands--

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.222 align:middle line:84%
and the awareness
of the individual

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:48.193 align:middle line:90%
that they are creator, yes?

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:51.496 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so, he happened
to be one of those beings that

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:54.833 align:middle line:84%
was in a very high profile
position that refused to accept

00:33:54.833 --> 00:33:58.269 align:middle line:84%
the status quo and that was
trying to do significant--

00:33:58.269 --> 00:34:00.538 align:middle line:84%
offer significant
change to the planet.

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:01.806 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:03.608 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So he had to be
taken away by those who were not

00:34:03.608 --> 00:34:05.777 align:middle line:84%
ready to allow that
change to occur.

00:34:05.777 --> 00:34:06.478 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Correct.

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:10.515 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What happened?

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:14.452 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it energetically
from your perspective-- I mean,

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:17.122 align:middle line:84%
I know, politically, we can
look at trickle down events.

00:34:17.122 --> 00:34:19.791 align:middle line:84%
But energetically,
what do you see

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.658 align:middle line:84%
happened at that time,
when he was removed?

00:34:21.658 --> 00:34:27.599 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It was not
unlike a crucifixion, yes?

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:31.468 align:middle line:84%
Making that strong of an
impact upon your world--

00:34:31.468 --> 00:34:35.907 align:middle line:84%
that that possibility could
occur and occur again.

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.075 align:middle line:90%
There were more than one.

00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:38.276 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:40.812 align:middle line:84%
And then we had Martin Luther
King after his brother--

00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:44.849 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: And the leaders
of the voice of compassion,

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:53.658 align:middle line:84%
and collective thought, and
collaboration were moving

00:34:53.658 --> 00:34:59.297 align:middle line:84%
in a direction of
cohesiveness of humanity, yes?

00:34:59.297 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Not control.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.235 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:06.337 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
toss that one out there

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:11.142 align:middle line:84%
because it's a pivotal
point in a lot of our minds

00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:15.346 align:middle line:84%
for our own history-- and as
a tribe, what that tribe has

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:16.481 align:middle line:90%
come in to do together.

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:18.716 align:middle line:84%
And I know, I'm just
using them as an example

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:20.885 align:middle line:84%
because it was kind of a
season of assassinations

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.820 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s, so to speak.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.354 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, let's going--
and going back to the human

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.765 align:middle line:84%
experience, I would like to
find out from you a little more

00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:34.699 align:middle line:90%
about what happens.

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Now, we came in.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.734 align:middle line:90%
We've experienced Earth.

00:35:36.734 --> 00:35:38.269 align:middle line:84%
We've gone through
many incarnations.

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:40.638 align:middle line:84%
We've matured to the point
where there's travel.

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:41.940 align:middle line:90%
We can move around the planet.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.408 align:middle line:90%
We can jump gene pools.

00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:45.577 align:middle line:84%
We can do whatever
we like by way

00:35:45.577 --> 00:35:49.013 align:middle line:90%
of experiencing this planet.

00:35:49.013 --> 00:35:51.516 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about what happens

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:56.487 align:middle line:84%
as we're choosing a body, a
physical structure, a vehicle,

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.923 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call that.

00:35:58.923 --> 00:36:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Before the incarnation
of the human,

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.964 align:middle line:84%
how that process lines up,
how the soul is interfacing

00:36:05.964 --> 00:36:08.199 align:middle line:84%
with the development
of the embryo,

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:10.468 align:middle line:84%
and then what they're going
to be in, occupying later

00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:12.670 align:middle line:90%
as a body--

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: There's a knowledge of
the soul of where they're going

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.011 align:middle line:90%
to come in-- timing.

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:27.485 align:middle line:84%
Some enter immediately, some
during the fetal process

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:31.222 align:middle line:84%
of growth, some
at birth-- but are

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:36.094 align:middle line:84%
aware of the environment in
which the chosen incarnation is

00:36:36.094 --> 00:36:40.498 align:middle line:84%
to be expressed and
to be experienced.

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:44.502 align:middle line:90%
And so the soul knows.

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:49.807 align:middle line:84%
There's souls that also know
if that fetus or the body

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:54.679 align:middle line:84%
will go to fruition
and will not enter.

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:57.548 align:middle line:84%
However, if it has
chosen that environment,

00:36:57.548 --> 00:37:02.820 align:middle line:84%
it may enter at a later time,
in another physical structure.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.424 align:middle line:84%
So there is never a
missed opportunity.

00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:12.964 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What is happening
just prior to the birth process

00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:16.234 align:middle line:84%
with the soul, the integration,
and those souls that come

00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:17.802 align:middle line:90%
in at birth?

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:21.472 align:middle line:84%
Give us an understanding
from a soul's point of view,

00:37:21.472 --> 00:37:25.309 align:middle line:84%
what that's like coming into
and joining with the vehicle

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:90%
as the birth is taking place.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.515 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It's a
joyous experience.

00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:33.351 align:middle line:84%
And know that the soul
can go in and out all

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:36.087 align:middle line:84%
during that period
of time, just as it

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:38.356 align:middle line:84%
does when there is a
death or a relinquishment

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:40.325 align:middle line:90%
of the physical body.

00:37:40.325 --> 00:37:42.427 align:middle line:84%
There is an in
and out experience

00:37:42.427 --> 00:37:46.898 align:middle line:84%
where the soul is going
into other dimensions

00:37:46.898 --> 00:37:50.301 align:middle line:84%
and back into body--
as the process of what

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:54.272 align:middle line:84%
you call death--
what we call is birth

00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:58.409 align:middle line:84%
to birth, one
dimension to another.

00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:01.679 align:middle line:84%
For you are coming into
a physical structure

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:05.683 align:middle line:84%
in the birth of a
baby or a fetus.

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.819 align:middle line:90%
There's a birth of an infant.

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:10.855 align:middle line:84%
It is a new dimension,
isn't it, that

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:13.958 align:middle line:84%
is encapsulated by
a physical form?

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:16.627 align:middle line:84%
When one leaves
that physical form,

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:21.766 align:middle line:84%
it is a birth once again into
another dimensional experience.

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:25.236 align:middle line:84%
It is just releasing
that physical form

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:27.271 align:middle line:90%
that's encapsulated it.

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:29.974 align:middle line:84%
You can liken it to a
butterfly or a caterpillar

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:32.577 align:middle line:90%
in a chrysalis, yes?

00:38:32.577 --> 00:38:36.380 align:middle line:84%
When the caterpillar enters
that chrysalis-- creates

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.184 align:middle line:84%
the chrysalis about it--
then it becomes gelatinous.

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:42.019 align:middle line:90%
There is no form.

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:44.822 align:middle line:84%
And it is there for a
gestational period of time,

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:48.192 align:middle line:84%
and then form begins,
just as in the world.

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:50.561 align:middle line:84%
And in that, the form
becomes the butterfly,

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:52.964 align:middle line:84%
and it breaks out
of the chrysalis,

00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:57.902 align:middle line:84%
and all its beauty, uniqueness,
and color is shown, yes?

00:38:57.902 --> 00:39:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's very similar in the
birthing process, is it not?

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.574 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:39:03.574 --> 00:39:06.277 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know
also about the notion--

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:09.547 align:middle line:84%
once you take that little
physical body, at what

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:11.816 align:middle line:84%
point does the memory
begin diminishing,

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
or has it diminished by the time
you've joined with the body--

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.022 align:middle line:90%
the memory of the past?

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.824 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It's retained
for a period of time.

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:21.159 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And how long is that?

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:24.896 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: That is why you've had
many accounts of young beings

00:39:24.896 --> 00:39:28.566 align:middle line:84%
speaking about other
experiences that they've had.

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:30.902 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Then so,
generally speaking--

00:39:30.902 --> 00:39:32.236 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: It's not general.

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:33.971 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So there
could be with one--

00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:35.907 align:middle line:84%
it's almost an immediate
loss of memory--

00:39:35.907 --> 00:39:36.908 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:39:36.908 --> 00:39:38.643 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: -- or
relinquishment of memory--

00:39:38.643 --> 00:39:39.744 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Release.

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:41.679 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then with
another one maybe not--

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:42.246 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Some, it
stays for years.

00:39:42.246 --> 00:39:43.414 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: For years?

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:47.418 align:middle line:84%
And then for some, of
course, it doesn't go away.

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:48.619 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Correct.

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:52.056 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And is it generally--
when a soul has chosen

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:56.727 align:middle line:84%
to forget at an earlier
stage in this development,

00:39:56.727 --> 00:40:03.167 align:middle line:84%
what is the most often-- what is
the general reason for letting

00:40:03.167 --> 00:40:06.170 align:middle line:90%
the memory go very early on?

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:10.641 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It is individualistic
why each soul--

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:12.543 align:middle line:90%
the release of that.

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:17.348 align:middle line:84%
Some are just coming into
an Earthly experience

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:23.721 align:middle line:84%
for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 10th
time-- very young soul.

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:26.424 align:middle line:84%
So there is the
need to release that

00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:32.663 align:middle line:84%
which was known before to
fully experience what is now.

00:40:32.663 --> 00:40:38.469 align:middle line:84%
But in a soul who has had many
incarnations, those veils,

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:41.639 align:middle line:84%
or that forgetting,
becomes less and less.

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:43.741 align:middle line:84%
And there's a blending
and a recognition

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:46.077 align:middle line:84%
of the multi-dimensionality
of itself.

00:40:49.714 --> 00:40:52.817 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what happens--
now, let's move beyond birth,

00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:56.420 align:middle line:84%
then-- into the other birth,
at the other end of life

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and to the other-- back
into the other dimensions?

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, there's this
transiting back and forth

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.662 align:middle line:84%
between dimensions
in and out body?

00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:05.863 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:07.598 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is often
when we'll hear someone

00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:12.637 align:middle line:84%
that's going through this phase
talking to loved ones, perhaps.

00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:15.172 align:middle line:84%
Is it more memory of
being in the past, or more

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:16.807 align:middle line:84%
going into other
dimensions where there

00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:20.678 align:middle line:84%
is a remnant of one
of those loved ones,

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:24.715 align:middle line:84%
or the actual astral aspect
or something of the loved

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:26.183 align:middle line:90%
one waiting for them there?

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:28.853 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: There's the actual
aspect of the soul there

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:33.157 align:middle line:84%
waiting there to
assist and to welcome,

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:37.328 align:middle line:84%
just in your human experiences,
there is often other humans

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:41.432 align:middle line:84%
there to welcome a new infant
into this new dimension,

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:43.034 align:middle line:90%
this new body.

00:41:43.034 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:84%
There is that in the
birth of other dimensions

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:51.542 align:middle line:84%
those of loved ones that are
highly connected soul to soul

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:53.577 align:middle line:90%
that are there in present.

00:41:53.577 --> 00:42:02.086 align:middle line:84%
So that often, this release
of the veils in those moments

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:06.357 align:middle line:84%
and times, for there
is all time existence.

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:09.727 align:middle line:84%
And so they are conversing
with their loved ones

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:14.865 align:middle line:84%
in interactive ways before
relinquishing the body

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:19.637 align:middle line:90%
to have a comfortable birth.

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:21.939 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And after the
relinquishing of the body

00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:24.742 align:middle line:84%
and going through that process
with the assistance of other

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:30.247 align:middle line:84%
loved ones-- and I know, again,
this depends from soul to soul.

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:32.516 align:middle line:84%
But can you give
us a flavor of what

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:38.522 align:middle line:84%
it's like between our
incarnations-- what our soul is

00:42:38.522 --> 00:42:43.828 align:middle line:84%
doing, whether we're
going through rest phases,

00:42:43.828 --> 00:42:49.233 align:middle line:84%
after the evaluation phases, and
so forth, recognition phases?

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:50.901 align:middle line:84%
We often hear about
people who are

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:54.338 align:middle line:84%
going into learning
environments or experiences

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:57.375 align:middle line:90%
between incarnations.

00:42:57.375 --> 00:42:58.609 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: There's all of that.

00:42:58.609 --> 00:43:00.177 align:middle line:90%
There is rest.

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:03.481 align:middle line:84%
There is an
exhilaration, a freedom

00:43:03.481 --> 00:43:05.082 align:middle line:84%
of a release of a
physical structure

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:07.218 align:middle line:90%
that no longer serves.

00:43:07.218 --> 00:43:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So there is this immediate
recognition of change.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:15.793 align:middle line:84%
And then there is a
bit of stabilization

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:17.161 align:middle line:90%
for some-- not all.

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:20.231 align:middle line:84%
Some are already aware
of what has occurred,

00:43:20.231 --> 00:43:21.999 align:middle line:90%
and they are prepared.

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:26.637 align:middle line:84%
There's a stabilization phase
for some of what has occurred.

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:31.475 align:middle line:84%
There is a reevaluation
of what has been learned.

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:36.781 align:middle line:84%
And then, there is this
time of recognizing

00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:40.151 align:middle line:84%
what one wishes to
do next, whether it

00:43:40.151 --> 00:43:42.153 align:middle line:84%
is to travel in
other dimensions,

00:43:42.153 --> 00:43:45.656 align:middle line:84%
whether it is to incarnate
again into a physical structure.

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:49.326 align:middle line:90%
It is all by choice, you see.

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:52.763 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let's talk about
what some of those choices are

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:56.200 align:middle line:84%
because as you've said before,
there are millions of choices.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.104 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to stay as a soul
in a pattern of incarnating

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:02.606 align:middle line:84%
and reincarnating
into human form.

00:44:02.606 --> 00:44:03.741 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: That is a choice.

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:07.578 align:middle line:90%
It is not demanded of you.

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So there are billions of choices
for the soul in many dimensions

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.887 align:middle line:84%
to experience many
different things.

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:20.024 align:middle line:84%
The mind cannot comprehend
all that there is,

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:24.462 align:middle line:84%
for you have no pictures
for what it may look like

00:44:24.462 --> 00:44:27.965 align:middle line:84%
because the human brain
thinks in pictures and past

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:29.500 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.736 align:middle line:84%
So there is not that
relativity to what

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.572 align:middle line:90%
we would express to you.

00:44:34.572 --> 00:44:38.309 align:middle line:84%
Just understand that there
are billions of choices.

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:40.544 align:middle line:90%
The Earth only being one.

00:44:40.544 --> 00:44:42.847 align:middle line:84%
Then, the question
is, why would one

00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:45.616 align:middle line:84%
incarnate into the
Earth many times over?

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:47.084 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
my next question.

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:51.355 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: For the beauty and
uniqueness of this Earth,

00:44:51.355 --> 00:44:56.927 align:middle line:84%
the experience of emotions, the
connectivity to others is still

00:44:56.927 --> 00:44:58.529 align:middle line:90%
present.

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:02.733 align:middle line:90%
It can vary with each soul.

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:05.236 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's also been
said that the Earth offers

00:45:05.236 --> 00:45:09.173 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity because
of the density,

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:12.843 align:middle line:84%
and because of the
notion of free will,

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:15.045 align:middle line:84%
and the diversity
of opportunity here,

00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:20.117 align:middle line:84%
for rather rapid learning,
compared to some other places.

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:21.919 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk
about that a bit?

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:25.389 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: That diversity--
there is rapid learning.

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:31.061 align:middle line:84%
There's continual feedback
to you in your experiences

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:33.397 align:middle line:90%
and the choices that are made.

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:40.070 align:middle line:84%
It is how you view
them that changes.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.774 align:middle line:84%
As you come more aligned in
your soul and the recognition

00:45:43.774 --> 00:45:48.812 align:middle line:84%
of the master that
you are, the intensity

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:55.352 align:middle line:84%
of reactivity to life situations
and circumstances changes.

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:57.421 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It seems like
it would be-- definitely,

00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:01.859 align:middle line:84%
it would be heaven on Earth,
once one learns to kind

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:04.195 align:middle line:84%
of graduate on an
emotional level,

00:46:04.195 --> 00:46:07.364 align:middle line:84%
into not so highly charged,
reactive, judgmental,

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:09.166 align:middle line:90%
and so forth a reality.

00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:12.736 align:middle line:84%
To be able to live within
that on this beautiful planet

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:15.372 align:middle line:84%
seems like it would
be quite a privilege.

00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:17.575 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Yes, and
it can be done.

00:46:17.575 --> 00:46:21.278 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of
you has that possibility

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:24.748 align:middle line:84%
of relinquishing all
beliefs, creating

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:28.886 align:middle line:84%
new-- of the knowing of the
beauty, unique, and divine

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:31.789 align:middle line:90%
essence that you are.

00:46:31.789 --> 00:46:35.526 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you give us
a feeling or a little sense

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:38.629 align:middle line:84%
of-- we talked about it
in our last conversation.

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.332 align:middle line:84%
There was a time during the
original third-dimensional

00:46:41.332 --> 00:46:43.167 align:middle line:84%
densities where
the environment was

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:46.670 align:middle line:84%
such it could support very large
species of people, of animals,

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.738 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:50.574 align:middle line:84%
Then we started becoming
more diminutive in size.

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:54.011 align:middle line:84%
And now we're beginning, as the
new frequencies have come in,

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:58.749 align:middle line:84%
to grow back, to begin expanding
a little bit in our size,

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:01.285 align:middle line:90%
and our lifespans, and so forth.

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:06.523 align:middle line:84%
If we looked at a trajectory,
say 1,000 or 20,000 years out,

00:47:06.523 --> 00:47:09.560 align:middle line:84%
where is Earth and
this species headed,

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.363 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our
physical reality?

00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:14.632 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: In the natural
evolution that is occurring

00:47:14.632 --> 00:47:19.903 align:middle line:84%
now, as beings are recognizing
the power that they have

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:23.974 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to pay attention
to the physical structure

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:28.479 align:middle line:84%
and honor that, there would be
a greater longevity in the years

00:47:28.479 --> 00:47:30.114 align:middle line:90%
of the lifespan.

00:47:30.114 --> 00:47:33.517 align:middle line:84%
But also, in the acceptance
of the physical structure,

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:35.352 align:middle line:90%
there will be that balance.

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:40.024 align:middle line:84%
And there will be larger
size beings once again.

00:47:40.024 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And by then, we would
have the consciousness to know

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:46.363 align:middle line:84%
that we are a product of our
own thought forms and so forth,

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:50.334 align:middle line:84%
so we would have the ability
to participate much more

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:52.503 align:middle line:84%
in our own self-healing,
if something were to go out

00:47:52.503 --> 00:47:53.671 align:middle line:90%
of balance.

00:47:53.671 --> 00:47:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So that alone should create
for greater longevity.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.176 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Yes, and that
has already begun.

00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:01.812 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what kind of
nutrients are our bodies truly

00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:05.883 align:middle line:84%
going to benefit more from in
these new energies than what we

00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:07.518 align:middle line:90%
have in the past?

00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:10.888 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: You have been more
refined and more aware of what

00:48:10.888 --> 00:48:13.457 align:middle line:84%
the body speaks to
you that it needs.

00:48:13.457 --> 00:48:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And as each being
listens, you will

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:20.364 align:middle line:84%
know what nutrients each
physical structure needs,

00:48:20.364 --> 00:48:24.835 align:middle line:84%
for you have very similar
structures, but very

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:31.408 align:middle line:84%
fine-tuned structures that are
to particular dietary needs

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:33.444 align:middle line:90%
to what the body will absorb.

00:48:33.444 --> 00:48:35.946 align:middle line:84%
So some will be
more plant-based.

00:48:35.946 --> 00:48:39.983 align:middle line:84%
Others will be more
animal-based proteins.

00:48:39.983 --> 00:48:41.785 align:middle line:90%
So it is individualistic.

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:46.623 align:middle line:84%
That is why each being
must pay attention.

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:51.328 align:middle line:84%
Listen to what the body speaks
to, for the body tells you

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:53.063 align:middle line:90%
where it's imbalanced.

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.932 align:middle line:90%
You just need to listen.

00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:57.434 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So there'll
be no one-size-fits-all.

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:58.235 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Correct.

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:02.139 align:middle line:90%
There are similarities, yes.

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:09.246 align:middle line:84%
But each being so
refined and more defined

00:49:09.246 --> 00:49:12.750 align:middle line:84%
in the soul's structure
and the uniqueness

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:19.423 align:middle line:84%
of that-- your personal
awareness is of necessity.

00:49:19.423 --> 00:49:22.693 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And speaking
of personal awareness,

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:25.796 align:middle line:84%
once we evolve to
the point, perhaps--

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:28.732 align:middle line:84%
will we evolve to the point
where perhaps we do not need

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:34.371 align:middle line:84%
to shut down our memory upon
incarnation and remain aware?

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:35.172 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:36.273 align:middle line:90%
It's already begun.

00:49:36.273 --> 00:49:37.608 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:49:37.608 --> 00:49:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So with that, is there going
to come a time when we will not

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:44.481 align:middle line:84%
necessarily need guidance
or guides to the degree

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:46.784 align:middle line:84%
that we've needed it
up until this point.

00:49:46.784 --> 00:49:49.353 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: You will
always retain guidance.

00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:50.687 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:49:50.687 --> 00:49:54.358 align:middle line:84%
And will our guides-- is it
normal that our guides continue

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:57.094 align:middle line:84%
to-- as we incarnate
the Earth, we

00:49:57.094 --> 00:50:00.964 align:middle line:84%
have a guide or two that will
come with us from incarnation

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:03.467 align:middle line:84%
to incarnation throughout
our personal history, then?

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:05.636 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes, soul connected.

00:50:05.636 --> 00:50:07.304 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And once
we have more memory,

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:11.408 align:middle line:84%
once we can master the
creation of our own reality,

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:16.213 align:middle line:84%
what is the guide's primary role
at this point in our lives--

00:50:16.213 --> 00:50:19.349 align:middle line:84%
as we have mastered more than
the-- say, looking 5,000,

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:22.986 align:middle line:84%
10,000, 20,000 years
into the future of Earth?

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:24.555 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: It's a
blended consciousness.

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you
explain a little more?

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.795 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: So there are no
veils that separate you,

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:34.832 align:middle line:84%
so there is a continual
way of education,

00:50:34.832 --> 00:50:36.967 align:middle line:90%
continual way of awareness.

00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:40.137 align:middle line:84%
So when in need of
a guide or a mentor,

00:50:40.137 --> 00:50:43.307 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is
always there in the asking,

00:50:43.307 --> 00:50:45.142 align:middle line:90%
just as it is now.

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:47.945 align:middle line:84%
But there would not be the
thought it could not be.

00:50:47.945 --> 00:50:50.781 align:middle line:84%
There would be an open
line of communication.

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.082 align:middle line:90%
It is a continuum.

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:55.519 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are there are some of
us that, between incarnations,

00:50:55.519 --> 00:51:00.324 align:middle line:84%
make the choice that we wish
to operate among this aspect,

00:51:00.324 --> 00:51:04.094 align:middle line:84%
as guides to others that we
are close to and care for?

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:05.462 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:51:05.462 --> 00:51:07.731 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's not uncommon
that someone's grandmother may

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:11.301 align:middle line:84%
die, for example, and that
person's going to-- after they

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:14.805 align:middle line:84%
adjust and rest a bit-- stay
on in that capacity within

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:15.572 align:middle line:90%
the family?

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:17.274 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:19.576 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then, there
are those from other places,

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:23.480 align:middle line:84%
other dimensions, other planets,
that also have this role?

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.215 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:26.950 align:middle line:90%
So it is very vast, you see.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.752 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:29.586 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do see.

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:38.061 align:middle line:84%
So the soul now--
this process of coming

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:41.632 align:middle line:84%
into conscious
partnership with what

00:51:41.632 --> 00:51:45.035 align:middle line:84%
we call the conscious
mind-- can you

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:48.372 align:middle line:84%
give us some final thoughts
on how we can really

00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:54.011 align:middle line:84%
help ourselves facilitate this
much deeper internal dialogue

00:51:54.011 --> 00:51:58.582 align:middle line:84%
between our soul and
our conscious awareness?

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:00.951 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Become aware of it.

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.252 align:middle line:90%
Know that it is so.

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:04.187 align:middle line:90%
You are not a victim.

00:52:04.187 --> 00:52:07.858 align:middle line:84%
You've chosen to be here--
to identify the fragmented

00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:12.195 align:middle line:84%
aspects of yourself that
is separated from you--

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:16.867 align:middle line:84%
to come into that wholeness,
changing beliefs that

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:19.870 align:middle line:84%
no longer serve you-- those
limiting beliefs that have been

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:23.240 align:middle line:84%
adopted by situations
and circumstances that

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.641 align:middle line:90%
have occurred.

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:28.278 align:middle line:84%
And they influence
your response to life.

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:30.981 align:middle line:84%
As you take
responsibility-- the ability

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:36.153 align:middle line:84%
to respond on the inner levels,
when one becomes agitated,

00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:42.626 align:middle line:84%
fearful, uncomfortable-- to
identify who is uncomfortable

00:52:42.626 --> 00:52:46.797 align:middle line:84%
inside and to sooth and
support from your higher self,

00:52:46.797 --> 00:52:52.536 align:middle line:84%
your future self, your adult
self-- giving support and love,

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:57.107 align:middle line:84%
and reparenting,
rewriting those beliefs.

00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:59.376 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I assume
meditation is a fabulous

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:00.911 align:middle line:90%
facilitative process.

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:03.847 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: Meditation
on a habitual,

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:10.654 align:middle line:84%
regular process allows you to
receive and to listen, yes.

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:13.523 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Any final thoughts on
this, the journey of the soul,

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:17.260 align:middle line:84%
our communication between us and
our own soul, and each other,

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.395 align:middle line:90%
if you would?

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:20.263 align:middle line:84%
>> THEO: If you could see
yourselves as we see you,

00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:22.766 align:middle line:90%
there would be no discontent.

00:53:22.766 --> 00:53:25.602 align:middle line:84%
You would be in alignment
to that brilliance

00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:27.971 align:middle line:84%
of the divine
essence that you are,

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and you would express
it externally.

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Love.

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.344 align:middle line:90%
Compassion.

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:34.911 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: Yes.

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:38.882 align:middle line:90%
We are complete in our asking?

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:39.516 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:40.684 align:middle line:90%
I am complete.

00:53:40.684 --> 00:53:42.185 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, THEO.

00:53:42.185 --> 00:53:44.955 align:middle line:90%
>> THEO: God's love unto you.

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:45.756 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:53:45.756 --> 00:53:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good day.

00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:00.904 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:02.606 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: Hi.

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:05.308 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sometimes, there are
little fragments of things that

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:06.209 align:middle line:90%
you remember.

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:07.511 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you
don't remember much.

00:54:07.511 --> 00:54:10.047 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you remember
a little bit more.

00:54:10.047 --> 00:54:11.982 align:middle line:84%
You hear the words
passing through you.

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:14.551 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that
you were seeing today?

00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:16.753 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, there
are things that are

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:19.156 align:middle line:84%
being shown that are not
necessarily verbalized.

00:54:19.156 --> 00:54:21.291 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
that you would

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:24.061 align:middle line:84%
like to impart to the
viewers at this point?

00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:28.065 align:middle line:84%
>> GILLETTE: Well, I just think
it's an exciting time if we all

00:54:28.065 --> 00:54:32.436 align:middle line:84%
understand that message of
how powerful we really are

00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:35.205 align:middle line:90%
and start living it.

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:39.276 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they'll say,
oh, well, that's for them.

00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:41.211 align:middle line:90%
It can't be for me.

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:42.345 align:middle line:90%
It is for you.

00:54:42.345 --> 00:54:44.081 align:middle line:90%
It's for all of us.

00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And don't we all want to
live this most empowered life

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:50.487 align:middle line:84%
that we can live and
live the life we dream?

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:52.122 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not just
for other people.

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:53.690 align:middle line:84%
It is for each and
every one of us

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:59.296 align:middle line:84%
if we choose, make the
decision, to do it,

00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:04.601 align:middle line:84%
because then the energy
aligns with that.

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:06.403 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
an exciting time

00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:10.040 align:middle line:84%
to be alive and be a part of
this shift of consciousness

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.842 align:middle line:90%
that's occurring right now.

00:55:11.842 --> 00:55:13.376 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank
you so much, Sheila.

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:15.011 align:middle line:90%
I just love our conversations.

00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:16.179 align:middle line:90%
>> GILLETTE: You're welcome.

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:17.481 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:19.449 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I hope you've found
this conversation with THEO

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:22.219 align:middle line:84%
interesting and even helpful in
understanding perhaps your own

00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:24.020 align:middle line:90%
family and soul dynamic.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.256 align:middle line:84%
If there any questions we
did not address, please

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:28.058 align:middle line:84%
feel free to post
them on this interview

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:30.494 align:middle line:84%
page for the next time
we meet with Sheila.

00:55:30.494 --> 00:55:34.464 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:38.602 align:middle line:90%
