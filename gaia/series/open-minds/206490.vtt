>>BEN STEWART: The mind.

Is that the last frontier?

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole thing
about transhumanism

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.940 align:middle line:84%
is you have to really boil down,
what does it mean to be human?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.930 align:middle line:84%
We can disembody ourselves and
become part of that one mind.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm looking
at technology as, is like,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:84%
is this something of our
design, or is it something

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:90%
that is wanting us to build it?

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are saying,
we are building and coding

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:84%
our own prison planet,
our own slave planet that

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:90%
knows every move that we make.

a crime against them anymore?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, no, because
of deepfakes, there's

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:90%
always reasonable doubt.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Nothing will beat
what biology gave us.

>>REGINA MEREDITH: Transhumanism
is a juicy but frightening

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.382 align:middle line:10%
topic for many of
us, and we're going

00:01:01.382 --> 00:01:04.190 align:middle line:10%
to take a deep dive into
it today with Ben Stewart.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
We'll begin with what
it is understood to be,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.800 align:middle line:84%
how it is moving into our
lives in ubiquitous ways,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and how we need to take
back our sovereignty.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot in 45 minutes, Ben.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:90%
But you can do it.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.577 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Well, let's hop in.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say it's an
honor to be back on the show.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.897 align:middle line:84%
You know, everyone
loved the show.

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's why we're
back together again, right?

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.055 align:middle line:90%

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:26.263 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: By popular demand.

00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:28.263 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They loved the
conversation last time,

00:01:28.263 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:84%
so let's make it
good this time too.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Great.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
dive right into it.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.367 align:middle line:84%
First of all, for
people who don't

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
have a broad understanding
of what transhumanism

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.330 align:middle line:84%
is, because it's really
bandied about in so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.950 align:middle line:84%
many different
ways, just give us

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:84%
a description of
transhumanism to lay the base.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Sure.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Transhumanism, even if
you type it into Google,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
it's a philosophical
movement believing

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
that science and technology
can do a couple things.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Can ameliorate all
suffering, and therefore

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
solve the problem of the
human condition apparently.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:10%
And then on top
of that, it's also

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:10%
enhancing the human experience.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:10%
And that's also
getting into, what

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:10%
can bliss be if we add senses?

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.115 align:middle line:84%
Not just replace
senses that are--

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:12.425 align:middle line:84%
like eyesight and hearing
that's going bad--

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Expand.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Expand on the senses
and make for a more blissful

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:90%
human experience.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's the main thing you
get when you go to Google.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
it sounds utopian,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:90%
so what could go wrong?

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:90%
I love those utopian ideals.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a negative
and a positive polarity.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And I hate making things
usually that simple,

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:84%
but I would say more on the
negative side or the side that

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe isn't as well informed
with it is the belief that we

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
can, let's say, skirt the
accountability of our biology,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and things like pain being
a messenger from nature,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
that if you listen to
and you listen well,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.830 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like having an
altercation with a lover.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.237 align:middle line:84%
If you listen well with
nonviolent communication,

00:02:57.237 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
you can get to the
bottom of something

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and really have a
healing catalyst emerge.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you can just hit
the mute button, like,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm tired of hearing this
and you hit the mute button,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
or pump a little
MDMA into the body

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
so you don't feel
that pain or you

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.450 align:middle line:84%
want to feel blissed
out, it can be,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, a circumvention
of accountability

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:90%
of what biology gave us.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But the grand thought
of it is those

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
are all pesky fetters or
chains to what we used to be.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's start looking more
at what we could be.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But what I would say the more
positive side of transhumanism

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
would be even what the
Buddha was all about,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
transcending the human
condition through the work.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Not by finding
something, outsourcing

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
the problem, and so we can
just have an easier life,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.100 align:middle line:84%
but also what a shaman
would do with a drum,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.050 align:middle line:84%
chanting words, using
words, and this ritual thing

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:84%
to, in a sense,
transcend the human body

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:84%
so they can become animalistic
or something beyond what they

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
are temporarily,
but then return.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.053 align:middle line:84%
This is an archaic
form of transformation.

00:04:05.053 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
going to say, it's

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:90%
often called enlightenment.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Mm-hmm.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So the word transhuman
has now become

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:84%
hardwired in with
hard technology.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.103 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Basically.

00:04:15.103 --> 00:04:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Nano or whatever.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.058 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: For the most part.

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the idea that
our consciousness is not

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:90%
bound by our biology.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it can be enhanced
with technology that can do

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:90%
what biology can't.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And you break
something on your body.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.350 align:middle line:84%
The new Armomatic
5000 is coming,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:90%
and same with all the organs.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
We already have
pacemakers that are smart.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:84%
We have smart insulin
pumps, and then now

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:90%
insulin and glucagon pumps.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the neural lace
technology that is evolving,

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:90%
and I have thoughts on that.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:84%
These are all things that are
wrapped around the philosophy

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.905 align:middle line:90%
of, we don't need a body.

00:04:55.905 --> 00:04:59.820 align:middle line:84%
We can disembody ourselves and
become part of that one mind.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.416 align:middle line:84%
Going back to-- as an
anthropologist, Teilhard

00:05:03.416 --> 00:05:07.035 align:middle line:84%
de Chardon or Chardin
I think was his name.

00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:84%
C-H-A-R-D-I-N. Anyway, he was
the first one to coin this idea

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.555 align:middle line:90%
of the noosphere.

00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a layer of just the
mind, the singular mind.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.023 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
people are saying,

00:05:18.023 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
well, that's the internet, and
that'll be cloud computing.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we're heading now

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
with smart cities, smart
everything, everything smart.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:90%
All technology has to be smart.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And connected.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And connected, and
computed somewhere, right?

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.287 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the big thing
is we have phones on our end,

00:05:35.287 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:84%
and we love it because of all
the things it does for us.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But on the opposite end
of that is big data,

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.375 align:middle line:84%
AI and cloud computing,
by people and algorithms

00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:84%
that we have no clue about,
and we're also not allowed to.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:84%
That will always
remain in the shadow.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And you know, to me, there's
one big question philosophically

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.270 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look into the
teams of people who originally

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
began working with AI and
then continued through some

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of the famous educational
institutions and such,

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I would want to
ask this question.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:84%
How many of them are
dyed-in-the-wool atheists,

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
dust to dust, and so
this is your only hope?

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Because my research early on
in this 10 years ago was that

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:90%
made up the body of it.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
There were very
few people that I

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
could identify with deep,
spiritual interest in practice

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking into,
committing themselves

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:90%
to the development of AI.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting you
say that, because when

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I started with what
is transhumanism,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:90%
it's a philosophical movement.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:90%
And I really look at these--

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I call them artifacts
of consciousness.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And some call them the
pillars of society.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
It's science, philosophy,
religion, and art.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
You'll find them
in every society

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:84%
as far back in time or
across the globe as possible.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be this thing that
even down to the individual,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
we all have our inner
scientist, philosopher.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:84%
In religion, I would say
it's our devotee, what

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:90%
we become devoted to.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And then art is
the way we express,

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
refinement process.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But when you mentioned the
atheism really driving the bus

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of this
transhumanism, it

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.800 align:middle line:84%
may have even started
well earlier than that.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And I also believe there
is a resurgence of a form

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of religion around technology.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.155 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:07:25.155 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell
us about that.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.077 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, in
today's day and age,

00:07:28.077 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
it's super hard to know what
media that I'm coming to see

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:84%
is real, fake, staged,
put different words to,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:90%
different narratives to.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:90%
But there's stuff around--

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go
too much into names,

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:84%
but let's say the Googles
and the big tech industries

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
with seemingly
well-formed seances

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:54.365 align:middle line:84%
in their courtyards in a very
cultish, religious fashion.

00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not going to--

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.573 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are you being literal?

00:07:56.573 --> 00:07:58.107 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Yes, a
video that I saw.

00:07:58.107 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is literal?

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.357 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, this is a
literal video that I saw.

00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
But here's where I will
also back off of that.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I've also seen tons of
videos where at first blush,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, whoa, that
paints a very dark,

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
grim picture of just
whatever I'm watching.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes out later
that, yeah, that was completely

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:90%
faked to see who bites.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So what I try and
do in these interims

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.410 align:middle line:84%
is I wouldn't doubt it
that religion is making

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
a form of resurgence
through technology,

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.980 align:middle line:84%
as if what's being built
here is not just gods.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean a
devotion to the technology

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle line:90%
itself is the religion.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: A devotion to the
technology as if it's a being.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
No longer just something
that we've created,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
not just something that will sit
around and maybe in thousands

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:84%
of years people
will discover what

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.370 align:middle line:84%
we were up to, but something
that legitimately supplants

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:90%
who we are as humanity.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's the whole
thing about transhumanism

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:84%
is you have to really boil down,
what does it mean to be human?

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us, well, we
say what biology gave us,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:84%
what we've had through the past
several hundred thousands years

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:90%
once humanity came online.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
But then you really
think of that,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:84%
is at what point did we
start becoming the cyborg?

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of us would say,
you have a cell phone?

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
You're already getting a lot
of your information through it.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know
information, you just

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.453 align:middle line:84%
hook up with your phone
for a couple seconds

00:09:24.453 --> 00:09:26.660 align:middle line:90%
and Google will tell you.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
There's ways that
you can connect

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:84%
through this
technology in real time

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.798 align:middle line:84%
better than we could have
imagined 40 years ago.

00:09:32.798 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and if
you're looking at it

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.210 align:middle line:90%
to supplant a library, OK.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, we do use outside
data to make decisions.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you're using
it to make decisions

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:84%
of a more innate nature
as to who you are,

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:84%
that's a whole
different-- that's

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
a different area of
engagement with technology.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
how that would work

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
religion of technology,

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:84%
when you don't trust your
own instincts at all anymore.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that's definitely
where I believe we're going.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
There there's several
elements to this.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
What I like about what
you just said, is we are--

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
so the positive side of this,
I think in transhumanism,

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:84%
if you understand more of
the positive side of it,

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.550 align:middle line:84%
you'll realize that it's
all about the human journey

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and the lessons
that our soul will

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:84%
learn in this
present incarnation,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
whereas technology
for a lot of people

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
is outsourcing our
responsibility to technology.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, where does that
matter more than others?

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:90%
You know, somebody loses a leg.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
You put a prosthetic
limb on there,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and there's 24 different
sensors and there's

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.100 align:middle line:84%
AI involved in it to make
somebody feel like, whoa,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a cyborg now.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I have my leg back.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel less human.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
I just feel more like
a complete human again.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So these are interesting
positive things

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:90%
that we can glean from that.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.292 align:middle line:84%
But the main part of the whole
thing about the outsourcing

00:10:53.292 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:90%
of our responsibility--

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to say.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the
outsourcing of responsibility

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and our own consciousness
and our ability

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.270 align:middle line:84%
to make innate,
intuitive decisions,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:90%
now we've got a problem.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the way that is being
used, for the most part,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:84%
is you see all the polarization
in politics right now,

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and the factions are really
going back to this tribalism.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And I look at tribalism
not as something to blame,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:84%
but it's more or
less like a flinch.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:90%
Somebody throws a punch at you.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't land,
but you retract.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:90%
You go back to where safety is.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.835 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that's
what tribalism does.

00:11:31.835 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:84%
When times are getting weird--
and times are getting weird--

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.420 align:middle line:84%
it seems exponentially
now we retreat back

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:90%
to what feels the safest.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And the safest is
this whole idea

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
that those who look
and feel and think more

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:90%
like me are on my side.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But now you take a
look at technology

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:90%
is native to children.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
They take to it so super
quickly that anyone

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
who's like, I'm going to keep
technology out of my life, how

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:59.810 align:middle line:90%
long is that going to last?

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
going to live forever.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And when that dies
off, there may

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:84%
be some new youngins
that grow up

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
push technology away.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But really, it just
seems that it's just

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:90%
becoming another limb.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming another
aspect of how we--

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.060 align:middle line:90%
our cognition, if you will.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So with children,
taking a look at that,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.670 align:middle line:90%
it's not so foreign to them.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, that placebo
effect will allow for them

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.570 align:middle line:84%
to just, how do I take
what I need and/or want

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:30.757 align:middle line:90%
to make me feel safe?

00:12:30.757 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:90%
So you see what I'm saying here.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.100 align:middle line:84%
There's tribalism
where we retreat

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.180 align:middle line:90%
to what we used to know.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Me and you who were born
before this technology

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.730 align:middle line:84%
got to this point,
we remember a time

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:90%
when it was about the people.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:84%
But now people are feeling
more safe behind a laptop,

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.662 align:middle line:84%
in front of their phone,
getting information.

00:12:50.662 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
saying the technology

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.177 align:middle line:90%
itself has become their tribe.

00:12:54.177 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: In a way.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:90%
In a way.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And I know I will
get crap for this,

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
but there are a lot
of people who say,

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:84%
you can't just throw one
into a bad and another

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:90%
into a good category.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:84%
We really have to take a
look at, what is technology?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And so when you really barrel
down into what is technology,

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:84%
we used to flint rocks so
we could make them sharp

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:90%
and use them as spears.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, the fire would have
been the technology, and on

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and on, all the way
to the smartphone

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.070 align:middle line:90%
and what we have nowadays.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So we have clear lines of what
we would call a technology.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.110 align:middle line:90%
There's us.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:90%
There's biology.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the tribal--
like, I trust biology

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:84%
because I know where
that comes from.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And then there's technology,
the things that we created,

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.280 align:middle line:90%
these artifacts.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm super curious
about, what is technology?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Is it sentient in some way,
even in an embryonic scale?

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.128 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of people who say,

00:13:51.128 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's going to
be intelligent like humans.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, does it have
to be intelligent like humans

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
to have a functional outcome
that just completely transforms

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:84%
humanity, maybe not
even for the best?

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm looking
at technology as, is like,

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:90%
what is this?

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Is this something of our design?

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something that
is wanting us to build it?

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's a
big, esoteric question.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So on an esoteric note,
I tend to look at things

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.890 align:middle line:84%
from the notion of
soul's journey, OK?

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Since we each have
one and it journeys.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And I look at it in
the larger sense.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
If you're a soul who's chosen
to incarnate during a time

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:84%
when this becomes
the opportunity

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and challenge on
the planet, we're

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.030 align:middle line:84%
choosing to engage with
it on some level en masse.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:90%
And toward what end?

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were all kind of
chatting a little while ago

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.150 align:middle line:84%
off camera, and the whole
notion of, which comes first?

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think back to the
series "Battlestar Galactica,"

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the end of
"Battlestar Galactica," what

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.970 align:middle line:90%
gives birth to what, right?

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I look at
it on that level,

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
and I think of a
little two-year-old who

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:84%
the majority of their
day is spent on an iPad

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.235 align:middle line:84%
or with a cell
phone in their hand.

00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:84%
What is the-- what is
the potential of good

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:90%
that can come from that?

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And what do we lose from that?

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Because that is now our reality.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It used to be you'd
sit someone down

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:84%
in front of "Bugs Bunny"
and a television set.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Then you'd go out and play.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
different interface

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.900 align:middle line:84%
with our physical,
third-dimensional reality.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It is.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
the back end of it.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Not that we know the
back end of our biology.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.205 align:middle line:90%
That's a timeless question.

00:15:37.205 --> 00:15:38.005 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:90%
It's evolving too.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.535 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And so these
questions are great for us.

00:15:41.535 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But that thing about the child
with the iPad in front of them,

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:84%
my biggest concerns on
an immediate level are,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:84%
we don't know what
the infrastructure--

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:90%
and we talked about this--

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:84%
the 5G and then the
coming 6G infrastructure

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:90%
means for our physiology.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know what
that means for our health.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.190 align:middle line:84%
In a slightly more psychological
or even an esoteric sense,

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:90%
we don't know--

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:84%
so there's these
goggles, and we're

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:90%
seeing what looks like reality.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:84%
But literally, it's only two
inches in front of our eyes.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.132 align:middle line:90%
How do our eyes change over--

00:16:16.132 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm
wondering about that.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
How do you even develop
depth perception

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.310 align:middle line:90%
if you never leave this space?

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Simple changes to us.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And now
thanks to what's

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:84%
happening in the
past couple of years

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and how that's accelerated
technology becoming

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:84%
even more a part
of our lives, we're

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:84%
really, really pushing
into a technological era

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:84%
to where we're seeing
children that are in school,

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and they all have
heads up goggles on.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, these full
immersive goggles.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It's even been
said that shouldn't

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.497 align:middle line:84%
be until at least in the
teens that you're putting--

00:16:49.497 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When the
brain is developed.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Exactly.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the biggest thing
about this is we don't know.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
things about technology

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:84%
is like, we just have to defer
to, we don't really know.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And so then you have
to ask yourself,

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
are we going to
slam on the brakes

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.810 align:middle line:84%
or ask for those setting
up the infrastructure

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.430 align:middle line:90%
to slam on the brakes?

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the logic on
the other side is,

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:84%
well, you can't
stop, because even

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:84%
if we came up with a treaty,
who's going to be the first--

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
China, Russia, the
United States--

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.480 align:middle line:90%
to have super AI weaponry?

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into
this in a little bit,

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%
but we are right
now in what's called

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.867 align:middle line:84%
an archetypal great
winter period.

00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain
what you mean by that.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: Well, so in
Strauss-Howe generational

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.950 align:middle line:10%
theory--

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:10%
and there's this amazing book
called "The Fourth Turning."

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth
turning is basically,

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.990 align:middle line:84%
that's the winter period, and
it's called the crisis period.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Always followed by
spring, which is a high.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So after a crisis, anything
better or a loosening of that,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.290 align:middle line:84%
it's like after P90X
and you start resting.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.490 align:middle line:90%
You're going to feel great.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:84%
The spring period
after that is a high.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Then there's an awakening.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Think back to the '60s and
that kind of a movement.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Then the unraveling.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Think the '80s and '90s with
Nirvana and all the music that

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:90%
started showing, we're not OK.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a perfect
utopian world.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.895 align:middle line:84%
And then now we're
back smack dab

00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
a crisis period.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.162 align:middle line:84%
And every 80 to 90 years,
you go back through history

00:18:18.162 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:90%
and you'll start seeing this.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're always
marked by war.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So 80 to 90 years ago, Great
Depression, World War II.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:84%
80 to 90 years before
that, Civil War.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:84%
80 to 90 years before
that, Revolutionary War.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Even before that in Europe,
the Glorious Revolution.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's representations of
this that go back even further.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Etruscans called
this, as pre-Roman,

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
were calling this the
saeculum, a long life.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the interesting
thing about that is we're

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:90%
in that period right now.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And usually every crisis period,
the greatest weapons of war

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:90%
come out.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're used, and
they're used on the people.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And it ends in, if you're
looking at it historically,

00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.840 align:middle line:90%
all-out war.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.220 align:middle line:90%
So where is it this time?

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Is it coming, or are we
already in the midst of it?

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Is it the mind?

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Is that the last frontier?

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.990 align:middle line:90%
The mind is--

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To co-opt
the mind, because that

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:90%
is how these wars are won now.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
It's all done through battles
of perception and mind

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:90%
manipulation.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, I have to say--

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and I've said this
on air before--

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.530 align:middle line:84%
I went through several
months of feeling depressed

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:84%
over what had happened to this,
as you call it, a reversion

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:90%
to tribalism, through this.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I call it a bifurcation of
consciousness on the planet,

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:90%
and how that was manipulated.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And I find it absolutely
fascinating as kind

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.340 align:middle line:84%
of a cultural study, but we're
living in the midst of it.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And so other than
disconnecting from technology--

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, again, that's a big one.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.250 align:middle line:84%
How else do we
take back our minds

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and have any
sovereignty in an age

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:84%
where we're being out and out
manipulated in a warlike way?

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Toward warlike ends.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's such
a good question.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
It's really the crux of all of
my work and where it's going.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of
mentioned it before,

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:84%
but there's this thing
within the human--

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and I call it a human artifact.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the inner artist.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's the culmination
of our inner scientist,

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.840 align:middle line:84%
our inner philosopher, and
our inner religious devotee.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's the expression
of all of those things.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:84%
It has all of that
inherent within it.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think these are higher
faculties of consciousness.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Rudolf Steiner called
these the higher faculties

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if God
were to ever speak

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:84%
with you or higher
intelligences,

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.430 align:middle line:84%
it may not even
sound like language.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:90%
It could just sound like music.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And so you think of the
phenomenology of music

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
as a language and why
shamans from time immemorial

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:84%
use drums, rhythm, melody, this
kind of fanciful thing that's

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
moving over the
predictable rhythm.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, listen to the
literal music culturally itself

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.900 align:middle line:84%
through these various archetypal
periods you're talking about.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It represents that.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And so
to me, I really feel

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:84%
the solution here is not the
complete checking out of,

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.990 align:middle line:90%
I can't deal with this.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Why was I born into
this time period?

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Because you mentioned--

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We all just
incarnate into it.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.030 align:middle line:90%
And we have the ability.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:90%
We do have the ability.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's very
difficult for people

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:84%
who have gotten into so much
self-talk that disempowers

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
them, that they feel
that they're afflicted

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:90%
by external circumstances.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And we become so hypnotized that
this is a punishment of sorts

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
that we forget that we have,
in a sense through choices

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and a series of
choices, woven ourselves

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.970 align:middle line:84%
into a feeling of how powerful
or powerless we might be.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.785 align:middle line:84%
And so the inner artist
really is one that will-- you

00:22:02.785 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
take a look at
all the tribalism,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and people are infighting
over their differences.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And the artist to me is the
one that steps back and says,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
out of this grotesque
horror that we see, how do I

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:84%
glean beauty from it, and then
start making the beauty what

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.047 align:middle line:84%
I will put in front of people
as an artifact to meditate on?

00:22:22.047 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that
means taking a beat

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:90%
and stepping back to begin with.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:25.993 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: For sure.

00:22:25.993 --> 00:22:28.915 align:middle line:84%
And the artist isn't
all about creating.

00:22:28.915 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot about listening.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
It's very much so
about listening.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And for me this whole
process was, OK,

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:84%
there's this left-right paradigm
in politics that's been there

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.818 align:middle line:84%
for quite a while,
and there always

00:22:39.818 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:84%
seems to be these flare-ups
and talks of insurrection

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and the infighting
that's going on.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And it seems a super
hot topic right now.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about all the
differences and the racism

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and the gender inequality, and
how the old paradigm of thought

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:84%
is too conservative and
we need to loosen it up

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:03.320 align:middle line:84%
to tolerate new forms of
ideas of what we could be.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:90%
You were born into this body.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.050 align:middle line:90%
You could be in that body.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a deconstruction
of a biological archetype,

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
an earthbound archetype that
was given to us that technology

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
is saying, hey, if you start
teasing apart these threads

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.112 align:middle line:84%
and unraveling
these concepts, then

00:23:21.112 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:84%
you could see-- look at all
these movies that we're seeing.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Almost everything is animated
thanks to the current--

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
not even actors can
get out there and film,

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:90%
so everything's animated.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine-- and I don't want
to jump too far ahead-- but--

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go ahead.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: By 6G--

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Alison McDowell was talking
about this thing called

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:90%
sentient world simulation.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is a real thing
that's being built.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically taking
real-time big data, all

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:84%
these separate silos, and
networking them together.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And in real time, having
a simulation of a world.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So for Regina, there's
several different avatars

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
that can be put through several
different computer simulations

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:84%
with this news that arrives
at her phone or whatever.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
She could act this way, this
way, this way, this way.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:84%
What are the most likely
ways, and how do we

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:90%
capitalize on it either for--

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:12.410 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Like, monetary--

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are we there already?

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Basically?

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes--

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Through
the manipulation of--

00:24:18.925 --> 00:24:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: NSA, DARPA, DOD.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these are
connected silos.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:84%
But people like
Nick Bostrom, he's

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
one of the foremost
thinkers on transhumanism.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Oxford University philosopher.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I try and listen
to all these people

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:84%
so I don't go too far into
my thought experiments

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and then start thinking
that it's real.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.530 align:middle line:90%
By the way, I'm not academic.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:40.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm an artist.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So as I come here, I came from
being a musician that tripped

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:90%
and fell into being a filmmaker.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And I find myself
at the precipice

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:84%
of all these conversations,
so I try and humble myself.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.480 align:middle line:84%
But when I start looking
at it, that liberty

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:84%
of being the artist
allows me to loosen myself

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
from the rigorous
scrutiny of academia.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And what that does, what Nick
Bostrom is basically saying

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.180 align:middle line:84%
is there are a lot of big data
silos that are not connected.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And we will notice--

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
we may not know
what it came from,

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:84%
but we will notice
when these big data

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.813 align:middle line:90%
silos start connecting.

00:25:15.813 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's almost like--

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What will be
the hallmark of that?

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, the
hallmark of it would be,

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:84%
you notice how social media
became an umbrella that

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:90%
changed content creation.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It changed a lot of
different markets.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.440 align:middle line:90%
How do we advertise to people?

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.020 align:middle line:84%
It became a monopoly
in all that.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a social machine.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
It's taking machine learning and
then it's taking social media

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and then turning it into
something like Amazon, which

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, how do we extract
value and resources from it

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:84%
within governmental guidelines
and laws and stuff like that?

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's an
algorithm to extract resources

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.843 align:middle line:84%
from the Earth based
upon our consent,

00:25:55.843 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and we don't even
know how we give

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:90%
our consent in this respect.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:90%
You're a part of Facebook.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
You've already
given your consent

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:90%
to how it will read your mind.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:84%
There's this technology about
actually reading your mind,

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:90%
which we can get into.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:12.260 align:middle line:84%
But to stay on point, the
sentient world simulation

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:84%
is basically this
real-world simulation

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
that is going to connect with
the international barcode

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.528 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to try not to
throw out too many names,

00:26:20.528 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:84%
but this international
barcode of life,

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the one that's
partnered with Microsoft

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and huge heavy hitters
that want to put a QR

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
code to every living
thing on the planet

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
so your phone can identify
every living thing.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Toward what end?

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, that's
a very good question.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I think the end game of
this isn't as dire as--

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
people are saying,

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:84%
we are building and coding
our own prison planet,

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.240 align:middle line:84%
our own slave planet that
knows every move that we make.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think that's wrong.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I question what intentions
are bringing us there.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.570 align:middle line:84%
What's actually-- what's
leading the way for it?

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of us, we love the
fact that we can take a phone

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and see what constellation
that is or identify that plant.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So we are demanding
it in many ways.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So in a very Charles
Eisensteinian way of saying

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.898 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:27:15.898 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:84%
because I was actually literally
just talking to him two days

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, the
thing about conspiracy,

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.170 align:middle line:90%
there's the mythological realm.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We know that
conspiracy is there,

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:84%
but when we really try
and tease apart who

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and how do we bring
accountability,

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
there's this legal system that
it's all limited liability.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't blame
this person at Microsoft.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:90%
You have to sue Microsoft.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Then who is harmed
when you sue Microsoft?

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Is Microsoft an
entity that makes--

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:84%
like, Microsoft
intends on making

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.320 align:middle line:84%
a third-stranded synthetic
DNA as an external hard drive.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Wait, does Microsoft
intend anything,

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.510 align:middle line:84%
or is it the people
there that intend?

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's not any one individual,
so what is this epiphenomena?

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of like tribalism.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:90%
It has its own mind in that way.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's this thing
that's building up.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the
next few years,

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:84%
it will become evident that
it has completely married.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has infiltrated
every aspect of our awareness.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's all the way down to
what we originally were saying.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.893 align:middle line:84%
It's the battle for the
mind, because George Orwell--

00:28:21.893 --> 00:28:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For consciousness.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.852 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: Well, and
there's several people

00:28:24.852 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:84%
who say really, if people
know they're being oppressed,

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.330 align:middle line:90%
they will always fight back.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.620 align:middle line:90%
There will always be a revolt.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But when
you don't know--

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: When they don't know,
and they're blissed out on MDMA

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and haptic suits that make them
feel like they're in an orgasm

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:84%
for three hours because
now that's on the market,

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.980 align:middle line:84%
then in a world where 2/3
of the internet is already

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:90%
pornography--

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are you
going to rebel against?

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:50.360 align:middle line:84%
People already love it And
also, where is accountability?

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows anymore.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
That line has become
completely blurred.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
at, can we even use

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.450 align:middle line:84%
video of somebody committing
a crime against them

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:84%
anymore because of deepfakes
and all these types of things?

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.848 align:middle line:84%
So you can see, well, that
looks exactly like this human.

00:29:05.848 --> 00:29:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
that person looks like.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.190 align:middle line:84%
It walks, it moves,
talks just like them.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And that person commits a
crime, but it's a video.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Can we go into the metadata?

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.110 align:middle line:90%
That was washed out.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So can we use that as evidence
to incriminate this person?

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, no, because
of deep fakes,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:90%
there's always reasonable doubt.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So does that change the
entire legal system now?

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.970 align:middle line:84%
We can't use video
evidence anymore

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.027 align:middle line:90%
once the precedent is set?

00:29:31.027 --> 00:29:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's down to the
question of what's real

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.490 align:middle line:90%
and-- what's real?

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:35.310 align:middle line:90%
What's real?

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I think
the very next step

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.970 align:middle line:84%
is we're not going to
have presidents anymore.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.220 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.185 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: At what
point are we a cyborg?

00:29:42.185 --> 00:29:45.270 align:middle line:84%
If you get a new arm,
are you a cyborg?

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Eh, not yet.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.580 align:middle line:84%
You still have all
your faculties.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:90%
You might as well--

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just have a
little technological assist.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.270 align:middle line:90%
And then a new heart.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And what if somebody--
like, I think Dick Cheney

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.960 align:middle line:90%
had no heartbeat at some point.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.093 align:middle line:90%
I heard that.

00:29:59.093 --> 00:30:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of jokes
were made about that.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to go deep
into that, but think about it.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Who would say no, I don't
want a president that

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a heartbeat?

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Because there are a lot of
people who say, that to me

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:84%
is a prerequisite to
knowing that you're actually

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:90%
compassionate.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And some would
say, well, where's

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.970 align:middle line:84%
your peer-reviewed
evidence on that?

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.270 align:middle line:90%
NIH hasn't funded that yet.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.310 align:middle line:84%
We have a president with
no heartbeat, no real legs,

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and yeah, now there's some
neural lace technology,

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.070 align:middle line:84%
like the Neuralink, the
embedded technologies.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.467 align:middle line:84%
And are those thoughts
actually theirs?

00:30:32.467 --> 00:30:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Who's coming up with this?

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're
already in that position.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: We are.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just deepening.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.460 align:middle line:84%
The confusion and the blurriness
of the lines is deepening.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So I put it into
human 1.0 or humanity 1.0.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what biology gave us.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Humanity 2.0 is
where we're at now.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of debate where

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:84%
in the line of humanity
2.0 we are on the road

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:84%
to humanity 3.0, which
is, if we ever get there

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and if it's even possible
to take your consciousness

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and put it into technology so
you don't have to have a body.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.110 align:middle line:84%
You're not confined by
what biology gave you.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:84%
All those pesky confines
of having an aching back,

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.040 align:middle line:84%
you know, all those types of
things, that's humanity 3.0.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.960 align:middle line:90%
So we're in humanity 2.0.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.440 align:middle line:84%
At what point do we
really start questioning?

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.277 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
everyone says we already

00:31:27.277 --> 00:31:29.860 align:middle line:84%
have people that come home from
war and they have prosthetics,

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and these prosthetics
are incredible.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:37.240 align:middle line:84%
AAMIs, Antagonist Agonist
Myoneural Interfaces.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Incredible types of prosthetics.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And then that starts
blurring that line.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And eventually we
get to the point

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:49.880 align:middle line:84%
where, where does the human
actually end at that point?

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.647 align:middle line:90%
And where does the human stop--

00:31:51.647 --> 00:31:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's not interfering
with your consciousness

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.750 align:middle line:84%
nor your decision
making processes yet.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Is it?

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:90%
We just-- I mean, how do you--

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To get a
well-functioning leg

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:03.760 align:middle line:90%
that seems a part of your body.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: What is our
science institution?

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:10.000 align:middle line:84%
How would we answer that
question of, does losing

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:90%
an arm change your psyche?

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.540 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
say absolutely yes.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Does getting it back
in bionic form just

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:84%
return you back to normal,
or is it forever changed?

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.617 align:middle line:90%
So to me--

00:32:20.617 --> 00:32:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Psychologically.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.660 align:middle line:90%
I hear you on that.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.785 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: There's this
book called "The Humachine"

00:32:24.785 --> 00:32:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that even posed the
question, at what point do we

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.480 align:middle line:90%
have AI for president?

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing is a lot
of people would be like,

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.310 align:middle line:84%
well, I would need to
know the reasoning.

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.670 align:middle line:84%
A president could
at least tell you

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:84%
the reasoning
behind bombing Syria

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.620 align:middle line:90%
or some other kind of act.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.480 align:middle line:84%
They can at least tell
you their reasoning.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And we can sit there and say,
I like this person or I don't.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I agree with their
logic or I don't.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Now they're trying to
get Siri in your phone

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.650 align:middle line:84%
to be able to explain its
logic on how it came up

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:54.970 align:middle line:90%
with the calculation.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
at what point are

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:00.085 align:middle line:84%
those lines blurred
to the point to where

00:33:00.085 --> 00:33:04.930 align:middle line:84%
the legal system, privacy, all
these fundamental linchpins

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
of why we arrived at the
Constitution of the United

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.210 align:middle line:84%
States at all anyway,
when that starts eroding,

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.580 align:middle line:90%
we still see the Constitution.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.710 align:middle line:84%
We see the surface where
everything was normal.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But everything underneath, the
foundation is fundamentally

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:84%
changing to where
eventually, some

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.870 align:middle line:84%
thought leaders are
going to get together

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:84%
just like our forefathers
did and say, a revolution

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.662 align:middle line:90%
is already upon us.

00:33:28.662 --> 00:33:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Because they weren't saying,
we need to start a revolution.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.453 align:middle line:90%
The revolution is already there.

00:33:32.453 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:84%
We already know
what we need to do.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:38.920 align:middle line:84%
How do we make it and put it
as an idea for generations

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.860 align:middle line:84%
to come so we can
still uphold this idea?

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And did they think that
was going to last forever?

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Did they think the Constitution
was going to last forever?

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.968 align:middle line:84%
So we really have to start
taking a look at, how long

00:33:48.968 --> 00:33:50.427 align:middle line:90%
do empires really last?

00:33:50.427 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A whole other subject.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.152 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: 250 years.

00:33:54.152 --> 00:33:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the average.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:90%
That is correct.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.675 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to re-think it.

00:33:58.675 --> 00:33:59.800 align:middle line:90%
You have to restructure it.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through
your revolution,

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:03.515 align:middle line:90%
and it's usually not peaceful.

00:34:03.515 --> 00:34:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: And so I want you
to get to the next question,

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:09.670 align:middle line:84%
but the very next thing about
that is everything in biology

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:10.969 align:middle line:90%
has its life cycle.

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about longevity

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of death
as if it's a pesky nuance.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So even the death of
empires, is it important?

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Like, why do we get rid--

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say
get rid of humans.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Could you make a philosophical
argument of the death of humans

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:30.739 align:middle line:84%
is to make way for new
life with new ideas.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:32.949 align:middle line:90%
I've said this many times.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Would I want to be in
this vehicle forever?

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:35.920 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:84%
I want to try
something different

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that has a whole other
set of capabilities,

00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:43.600 align:middle line:84%
different creative kind
of inputs, and so forth.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
understand the attachment

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:49.750 align:middle line:84%
to wanting to live-- this whole
notion, the original transhuman

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.780 align:middle line:84%
movement, a lot of the stuff
out of MIT, to live forever.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Immortality was the goal.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Nothing lives forever.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Not even our cosmos
lives forever.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, I mean,
that's something

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask
ourselves, how deeply

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.560 align:middle line:90%
we choose to engage with it.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.570 align:middle line:90%
What is the fear driving that?

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I wanted
you to launch off on here,

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.600 align:middle line:84%
because it's very important,
and it's what you said earlier.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.590 align:middle line:90%
You're an artist.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.680 align:middle line:90%
You have a flexible mind.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.990 align:middle line:90%
You have a creative mind.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And every one of us
has an internal artist

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.580 align:middle line:84%
if we choose to
access that part.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:26.380 align:middle line:84%
The thing about being an
artist is having the ability

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.940 align:middle line:90%
for independent thought.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's being
overridden right now

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:90%
is independent thought.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's now talk about
the artist's way forward.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: OK.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK?

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Because we can see,
we've got a plethora

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.840 align:middle line:84%
of potentials and
potential problems

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to
ultimately deal with.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.800 align:middle line:90%
So let's start now.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.308 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:47.308 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:90%
You're definitely right.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So the artist really stems from
that artifact of consciousness,

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:84%
the ability to listen and to
take all the resources, all

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.070 align:middle line:84%
the input, everything
that we know,

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and then also the openness
to the downloads of something

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.350 align:middle line:90%
novel or salient.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:08.888 align:middle line:84%
There's neurochemical things
that happen in the brain,

00:36:08.888 --> 00:36:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
try and get into,

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.720 align:middle line:90%
that's the explanation of it.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.850 align:middle line:84%
I think what's happening in the
brain is a correlation of it,

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.370 align:middle line:90%
and so we shouldn't--

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that's another part
of the transhumanism

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.210 align:middle line:84%
is taking a look at the
wetware of the brain,

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:22.040 align:middle line:84%
reproducing it, and
thinking that's all

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:90%
that there was to the story.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, not.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Confusing
it with mind.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the artist,
really to me, here

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:84%
is why I'm actually super
hopeful about what's

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:36.080 align:middle line:84%
going on in the world,
is because there's

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:90%
something about crisis.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was John
F. Kennedy who pointed out

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:46.560 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese symbol for crisis
and opportunity are identical.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.050 align:middle line:90%
So there's something about that.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.150 align:middle line:84%
There's an element,
these dueling dragons.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Like, yes, there has
to be the challenge.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.670 align:middle line:84%
There's the pressure on the
coal that creates the diamond.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And then there's that thing
that emerges out of it.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we love escaping
suffering and going for pain,

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.260 align:middle line:84%
but-- or I'm sorry, escaping
pain and suffering and going

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.463 align:middle line:90%
for pleasure.

00:37:07.463 --> 00:37:09.380 align:middle line:84%
There's something deeply
about the artist that

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:14.450 align:middle line:84%
takes suffering and pain
and draws forth the beauty

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.690 align:middle line:84%
from within it, and
represents it in a new way,

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and really shows there's
that sovereignty of choice

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and decision making, which at
present hasn't been eradicated.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
linking our minds to computer

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.930 align:middle line:90%
and cloud-based technology.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that can
become the singular mind.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the whole
post-human idea.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:38.330 align:middle line:84%
It's after transhumanism is
having that singular mind.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.165 align:middle line:90%
And where does the artist go?

00:37:40.165 --> 00:37:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of people
that are just saying, listen,

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.082 align:middle line:84%
this is where
technology always went.

00:37:44.082 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Single-celled organisms
had to combine so you

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:90%
can have your experience.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's make way for
the next thing.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, I agree,
or I understand the logic.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But where that strips
out the accountability

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.510 align:middle line:84%
is, where are you taking care
of you in the here and now?

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.860 align:middle line:90%
What is your soul telling you?

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.575 align:middle line:84%
In the here and
now is important.

00:38:05.575 --> 00:38:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you
even listening?

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the hugest thing
about the transhuman thing

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.300 align:middle line:84%
is the removal of our
own accountability.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.433 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: And that feels great.

00:38:14.433 --> 00:38:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Overriding
internal messages

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:17.220 align:middle line:90%
with external messaging.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the very crucial,
important task of the artist

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.410 align:middle line:90%
nowadays are--

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, especially
right now in history

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:30.440 align:middle line:84%
is at this important
juncture to get back

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.690 align:middle line:84%
to some of the
primal meeting places

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:35.100 align:middle line:84%
where the artist would
always come out as well.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So cultivate the environment
where the artist always

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:39.630 align:middle line:90%
seems to emerge.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's community.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.125 align:middle line:90%
That's always community.

00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where does
nature factor into this?

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.843 align:middle line:84%
And I include
nature in community,

00:38:46.843 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:84%
because when I
think of community,

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.853 align:middle line:90%
I really do think back to--

00:38:50.853 --> 00:38:52.520 align:middle line:84%
did you ever read the
"Anastasia" books?

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I
read all of them.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: "Ringing Cedars."

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Loved them.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yes.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.140 align:middle line:84%
There's some way that
they talk about how

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.330 align:middle line:84%
you need to introduce
the bees, and you

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
need to introduce
the different insects

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.272 align:middle line:90%
and the different plants.

00:39:02.272 --> 00:39:03.230 align:middle line:90%
And you take the seeds.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.522 align:middle line:90%
You put them under your tongue.

00:39:04.522 --> 00:39:05.360 align:middle line:90%
You let that fuse--

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.105 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Genetic information.

00:39:06.105 --> 00:39:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: You plant
the thing from seed.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.290 align:middle line:90%
It grows into your medicine.

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:09.890 align:middle line:90%
You eat it.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Like, wow.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.290 align:middle line:90%
What a closed loop system.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.410 align:middle line:84%
That's what the artist
would really do.

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:17.810 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's what
the ultimate artist,

00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:90%
not just the narrow artist.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
narrow AI and general AI.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Narrow AI can only solve the
problem that it's been chosen--

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.090 align:middle line:84%
like chess or
something like that.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:34.010 align:middle line:84%
General AI will be once
AI learns to learn.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.270 align:middle line:90%
It learns how to learn.

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And it comes up with new,
novel ways on how to learn.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.950 align:middle line:90%
I think that's already here.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:43.370 align:middle line:84%
We're in a sense recreating
what's already there,

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.830 align:middle line:84%
and we're marveling at it
like, look what we did.

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're forgetting,
no, no, no.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.850 align:middle line:84%
We downloaded this
and we transferred it

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.090 align:middle line:84%
to another medium, probably
not even perfectly.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're negating
the gift of biology.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is where Charles
Eisenstein comes in.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:01.340 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
our gifts are what

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.210 align:middle line:90%
we need to serve humanity with.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.010 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The amount of
intelligence in our biology

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.550 align:middle line:84%
is being completely
overlooked in all of this.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Looking to outside
technology and sensors

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.830 align:middle line:84%
to, say, for
example, tell us how

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:19.370 align:middle line:84%
our body's doing when this
incredible intelligence is

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:84%
emanating it from it and
speaking to us all the time.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:24.260 align:middle line:90%
No, don't listen to that.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Listen to what this guy or
what this machine over here

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.410 align:middle line:90%
has to say.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.870 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
simplistic way in which

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:35.930 align:middle line:84%
this discouragement from
listening to our own self

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:36.740 align:middle line:90%
is happening.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.390 align:middle line:84%
The medical field
is one of them.

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:41.150 align:middle line:84%
The educational
field is another one.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Every institutional field is
rife with encouraging us not

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.230 align:middle line:84%
to listen to our
native intelligence,

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:51.900 align:middle line:84%
biological intelligence,
intuition, and instincts.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Not cool.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.760 align:middle line:90%
And now you add AI to it.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.480 align:middle line:90%
And so for me, I wonder--

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I really take a look
at the complexity

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and also where this agenda
has been moving through.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.450 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of key players
that the names haven't changed,

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.630 align:middle line:84%
so there's definitely
some accountability that

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:90%
needs to be looked at here.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But then there's also
going back into time

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and taking a look at things
like the educational system.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.330 align:middle line:90%
That is a perfect--

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:19.730 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to look at
a perfect prerequisite

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.140 align:middle line:90%
to the transhuman agenda--

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.240 align:middle line:84%
because what is the
educational system?

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not Plato's
idea of education,

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.680 align:middle line:84%
meaning drawing forth
our inner brilliance

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.930 align:middle line:90%
and our inner intelligence.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.430 align:middle line:90%
It's programming.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.310 align:middle line:84%
It should be rightly
called programming.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Because you look what
they did in Hawaii.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.420 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to
speak your language.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.880 align:middle line:84%
You were savages and
primitives before we came--

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You are preaching
to the choir on this one.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be completely
overhauled and stripped down

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.350 align:middle line:84%
to its studs and
organically created

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:51.690 align:middle line:84%
for each community, each
region of the world.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: So that
to me is the future.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
I really stand.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I feel that-- whenever
I hear of these brand

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.990 align:middle line:84%
new methods that people
are using to engage back

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.880 align:middle line:84%
with their own
innate intelligence,

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:84%
they all have very similar
categories that they

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.640 align:middle line:84%
fall into, common
denominators of what life

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.840 align:middle line:84%
has always kind of bounced
around within, the terrains.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And another thing is we need to
get this down to the children,

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and we need to revamp
what education really is.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And so introducing play
again is the original way

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:31.150 align:middle line:84%
all mammals and probably
even prior to that,

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:32.530 align:middle line:90%
it's how we learn.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And through things
like-- it may seem

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:39.072 align:middle line:84%
pretty just primitive for dogs
to wrestle and rah, rah, rah.

00:42:39.072 --> 00:42:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you see little kids
wrestling and stuff like that.

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.240 align:middle line:84%
How else do they
know how to work

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.860 align:middle line:84%
their myofascial and
neuromyofascial and

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.770 align:middle line:90%
neuromuscular wetware?

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:54.550 align:middle line:84%
How do they know how to
work this thing in gravity

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and with such lush
dynamics as nature

00:42:57.130 --> 00:42:59.350 align:middle line:84%
and contending with
the microbes that you

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:00.850 align:middle line:90%
get under your fingernails?

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:01.960 align:middle line:90%
You have to play.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.580 align:middle line:90%
You have to go out and explore.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.640 align:middle line:84%
This is where 6G
infrastructure, which

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.820 align:middle line:84%
is the habitat for
cyborgs, it's literally--

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.695 align:middle line:90%
think of a terrarium.

00:43:10.695 --> 00:43:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm going to put twigs
and sticks and leaves inside

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.150 align:middle line:84%
of a glass thing, and
I'll put a frog in there,

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:17.830 align:middle line:90%
and it'll feel super at home.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:22.090 align:middle line:84%
That to me is 5G, 6G, and
pretty much all the Gs.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to start seeing
it more as a cyborg terrarium.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's more habitable
like all the smart cities,

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:33.520 align:middle line:84%
which there are hundreds
in China right now.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.320 align:middle line:84%
You're literally walking
around inside of a device.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And how many people of the
populace are really saying,

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.620 align:middle line:90%
this is super weird?

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:42.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.350 align:middle line:84%
We're just taking to
it like that individual

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:47.560 align:middle line:84%
took to that leg and said,
this is an extension of me.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Two things I want to say.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:51.910 align:middle line:84%
That's a brilliant
aspect of our wetware

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that your neurology can
find new, novel ways

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:00.220 align:middle line:84%
to take external stimuli
and revision what's

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.600 align:middle line:90%
happening in the outside world.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Real quick.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.710 align:middle line:84%
David Eagleman did a TED Talk
where he had somebody hooked up

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:06.610 align:middle line:90%
to a vest.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was just sending
sensory inputs like touch

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.910 align:middle line:90%
to the chest and the back.

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was just done
in a symbolic way,

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:19.630 align:middle line:84%
but in a consistent way, enough
for the neurology of the person

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:23.380 align:middle line:84%
to be able to translate the
seemingly innocuous messages

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:27.100 align:middle line:84%
coming through these little
touch patterns on the body,

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to translate a noise to a
deaf person through touch

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.630 align:middle line:84%
so they can throw a ball
through a basketball hoop,

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.170 align:middle line:90%
and things along those lines.

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So translating what's happening
out here through different

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.690 align:middle line:90%
means so we can still see.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And now you have people
like Daniel Kish.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you know who that is?

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:44.457 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I don't.

00:44:44.457 --> 00:44:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: He went
blind at age five,

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and his parents were like, do
you want to be a blind kid,

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:51.977 align:middle line:84%
or do you want to be like
all the rest of your friends

00:44:51.977 --> 00:44:53.060 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life?

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.435 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I
want to be normal.

00:44:54.435 --> 00:44:55.840 align:middle line:90%
They said, get up on your bike.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Start riding your bike around.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And he would crash,
and they would not

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.790 align:middle line:84%
let him go into the
pity party thing.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.740 align:middle line:84%
He eventually
started echolocating.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.120 align:middle line:90%
He would just do these little--

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.590 align:middle line:90%
[CLICK] with his mouth.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And you see him now
walking around with a cane.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.400 align:middle line:90%
He still uses it.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.320 align:middle line:84%
But he can stand
inside of a gazebo

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and be like, oh, well,
there's a pole over here.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.150 align:middle line:84%
There's this weird--
it's not a full roof,

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:90%
but it's like maybe a lattice.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have
that innate capability.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: It's already in us.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.288 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's already in us.

00:45:22.288 --> 00:45:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I did those experiments
with some shaman

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.380 align:middle line:84%
where they go somewhere
like 50 yards away.

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Everything's silent.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And you have to find them
blindfolded and touch them.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not that hard to do.

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:35.510 align:middle line:84%
These are already
innate abilities.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Right.

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So you notice how we're getting
so fascinated by the technology

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:43.250 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of it-- not most
of it-- but a lot of it

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:45.702 align:middle line:84%
is pointing us back
at our own potential,

00:45:45.702 --> 00:45:46.910 align:middle line:90%
and we don't see it that way.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.368 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
see it that way.

00:45:48.368 --> 00:45:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's the beauty in this
is that it's showing us--

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.788 align:middle line:84%
potentially showing
us our potential.

00:45:52.788 --> 00:45:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: We need to reframe--

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.413 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We need to reframe it.

00:45:55.413 --> 00:45:56.867 align:middle line:90%
So we have almost no time left.

00:45:56.867 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going ask you in
just a half a sentence,

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.750 align:middle line:84%
scariest thing on the horizon,
most beautiful, hopeful thing

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:04.670 align:middle line:84%
on the horizon in
your viewpoint.

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Hmm.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Scariest thing on
the horizon would

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:16.840 align:middle line:84%
be that we are going to create
this simulated environment

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.090 align:middle line:90%
that we've been talking about.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Like, are we living
inside of a simulation?

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we are.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I think we're building
it and preparing people

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:28.200 align:middle line:84%
with the argument to not notice
with all these animated movies

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.220 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.530 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the
scariest, because we

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.530 align:middle line:84%
won't know what revolt
even means by that point.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And our agency, that word
agency and sovereignty of choice

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.000 align:middle line:90%
will be eradicated.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Could be eradicated.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.930 align:middle line:90%
But to me, there's always--

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.205 align:middle line:90%
and this is the most--

00:46:47.205 --> 00:46:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The most hopeful.

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: The most hopeful
is the fact that I think--

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.582 align:middle line:84%
you notice how there are some
people who listen to records,

00:46:54.582 --> 00:46:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and they hear CDs
and they're like,

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.200 align:middle line:84%
no, the analog is
better than the digital.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Most people can't tell.

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:02.580 align:middle line:84%
But the real ones who
are listening, they can.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Nothing will beat
what biology gave us.

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:06.210 align:middle line:90%
That's what I really feel.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's always there.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:09.750 align:middle line:90%
It really is always there.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:12.990 align:middle line:10%
And I even think if we do
find a way to disembody,

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.780 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't mean it's impossible
to find our way back.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.500 align:middle line:10%
It's just going to
make it a lot harder.

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:21.870 align:middle line:10%
So please, people, let's make
sure we don't go all the way

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:23.490 align:middle line:10%
to that post-human world.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's a way to cohabit.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the artists wants.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.262 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Use the
best of technology,

00:47:29.262 --> 00:47:32.290 align:middle line:84%
but stay within the intelligence
of the biological world.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: And understand this.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.020 align:middle line:84%
We've got this, because
we've always had this.

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.350 align:middle line:10%
Don't disempower yourself by
believing the outside world

00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:42.000 align:middle line:10%
is too tricky for
you to navigate

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.380 align:middle line:10%
so you throw your hands up.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Start getting back in touch
with the inner artist.

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Meditation,
contemplative exercises.

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:50.545 align:middle line:84%
Use your body,
play, and community.

00:47:50.545 --> 00:47:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Couldn't
agree more with you.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it will become
and it is already a choice.

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Yeah.

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:57.237 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have a choice.

00:47:57.237 --> 00:47:58.560 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much, Ben.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:47:59.460 align:middle line:90%
The time has flown.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.050 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it's five
minutes, and obviously we'll

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:02.850 align:middle line:90%
do this again.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: Perfect.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We didn't even get
to the last three pages or so.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
coming here again.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>>STEWART: You're welcome.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Loads of
information to consider here.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.215 align:middle line:10%
You might want to
watch this one again.

00:48:13.215 --> 00:48:15.733 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, you can check
out Ben's work here on Gaia.

00:48:15.733 --> 00:48:17.650 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:19.120 align:middle line:10%
