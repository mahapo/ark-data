00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE HARRIS: They're
talking about what

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.850 align:middle line:84%
the soul of a human on Earth is
evolving into, and warning us

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:84%
of some of the ways that
we don't want to go.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.790 align:middle line:84%
By all means, look
up and look out.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.000 align:middle line:84%
But they say, the Earth
is coming on line in ways

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.482 align:middle line:90%
that we have never experienced.

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
That's exciting.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the Z's
when you're ready.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:84%
This transmission in itself,
it is multidimensionality

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.300 align:middle line:90%
in action.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Remember too, that you are
all balancing the planet,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:84%
so the bliss bunnies are, we
will say, bringing balance

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:90%
to the emotional rage machines.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
If we could show you how many
things have been averted when

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.250 align:middle line:84%
it comes to destruction,
you would be both horrified

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:90%
at first, and then relieved.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.330 align:middle line:90%
But you would be horrified.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.323 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.323 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's
been a little while

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:10%
but we have Lee
Harris back with us.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.110 align:middle line:10%
As is always the case, he'll be
giving us both some of his time

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:10%
and the Z's.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And the message is
evolving very rapidly.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes though we need to go
into the architecture of what

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
it is to be human before
we can build on it.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.637 align:middle line:90%
And this is really fascinating.

00:01:21.637 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
we're going to do today.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.298 align:middle line:84%
Lee, I just love
seeing you again.

00:01:25.298 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful having you back.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I always
love being with you.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for having me back.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's been a little
while, a couple of years,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.500 align:middle line:90%
at least.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I think
it's been a few years.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because before COVID.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.555 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We had to cancel one.

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.818 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, anyway,
it's lovely to see you.

00:01:37.818 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
You never change and just
emanate the sweetest energy.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:10%
So I just want to talk to
you about your new book,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.607 align:middle line:10%
"Conversations
with Zs, Book One"

00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:47.065 align:middle line:10%
which notes there's probably
going to be a book two, three,

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:10%
four, five, et cetera.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:10%
It's the beginning of a series.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:10%
And this is your
friend, Diane Edwards,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.180 align:middle line:10%
who is-- is she a psychologist?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.945 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: She's a
psychotherapist.

00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A psychotherapist.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she
is the one that's

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:84%
asking the questions of the Z's
on behalf of everybody else.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And this particular book has
some really important stuff

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:90%
for right now embedded in it.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So it seems the Z's are
cashing in on our attention,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:84%
where our attention is
at this time in history.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.675 align:middle line:10%
Something definitely kicked
up a gear for me in 2019.

00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:10%
I mean I think probably everyone
can say that about their life.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.717 align:middle line:84%
But something about the work
and the channeling, something

00:02:25.717 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:90%
went to another level.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And this was six
months ahead of COVID.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, it all
made sense when COVID kicked in.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:10%
So the book series came because
of the recorded conversations

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.230 align:middle line:10%
we did.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was at the end of the
first day of these recordings,

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:90%
it was--

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I was very clearly
told this is a series.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a
series, a whole row of them.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
But the first one is called
the Energetics of the New Human

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Soul.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Because they're talking about
how our soul is evolving right

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:84%
now, and what the soul
of a human on Earth

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
is evolving into, and warning
us of some of the ways

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
that we don't want to
go, and reminding us

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
of some of the intrinsic truths,
as to who we are as a soul,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and why we're here
in the first place,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.668 align:middle line:84%
trying to let more of
ourselves come through.

00:03:14.668 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Humans
are quite an enigma.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:90%
We're a mystery in the universe.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And we have so many
influences here on the planet.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'm not
going to be able to get

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
to some of that today with
the Z's that I would love to,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.010 align:middle line:84%
because we have so much
more to talk about.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But what you just said,
the evolving soul.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
My group of beings that I'm
associated with, my guides,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
have called us as
soul development.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they call
us a soul development.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.888 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, is
that true elsewhere.

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about it one day.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
no, the uniqueness

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:84%
of the human being,
because of our origins,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:84%
is completely
different because you

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
have this combined
being that's now human,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:90%
and this isn't normally done.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And that is still under
development and evolving,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:84%
where in other places
these are a stable species.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And the Z's have also been
talking a lot recently

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.074 align:middle line:90%
about the--

00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
they-- they go back
about 10,000 years or so.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And they speak about
when we were essentially

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:84%
clamped on Earth, and they
make parallels to Atlantis,

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and they speak about how
the soul was designed

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
to be in the human
body, in a far more

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
vibratory, and sensory, and
full way than we see today.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're at that point
where all of the conditioning

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and programming over these
last set of many thousand years

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
is we have an opportunity
where it's all breaking apart.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And the opportunity
is for us to, again,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.695 align:middle line:84%
reclaim that
sovereign soul self.

00:04:46.695 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's critical
because of the beauty

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.945 align:middle line:90%
of what we are at the core.

00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:53.762 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my guide saying,
the conscious mind that you

00:04:53.762 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:84%
know, this part, that
you call the left brain,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
was really-- it's really
only there to keep you

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:90%
from bumping into things.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
You were supposed to have the
entire mind integrated, which

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:90%
mind is everything.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds like
what they're saying.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:84%
That mind needs to be
permeating all of us,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
so we can operate at much more
intuitive, creative, healthy

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.590 align:middle line:90%
capacity.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.557 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny you say that.

00:05:17.557 --> 00:05:19.900 align:middle line:84%
I think of my own
journey, one of-- one

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:84%
of the great gifts for my
own ego in being a channeler

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is having to learn to
not worry about judgment,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.580 align:middle line:90%
or what people think of me.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.237 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And that's been very
helpful in my own learning.

00:05:30.237 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But the greater truth
is we're all intuitive.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.050 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected
to all of it.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And the myth is that certain
people have that capacity.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:84%
The truth is certain
people at this time

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:84%
are showing that capacity
to remind the rest of us,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.438 align:middle line:84%
this is for all of us, and
we're all connected to this web.

00:05:47.438 --> 00:05:48.238 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:48.238 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But we
have been trained

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.938 align:middle line:84%
and trained to forget it,
and discouraged away from it.

00:05:53.938 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let me ask you this,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:84%
just going back to what
you said a moment ago.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.910 align:middle line:84%
You said about 10,000 years
ago humanity was clamped.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And you know, I--

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I've skirted around
this, and tried

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
to talk to the Z's
about it in the past.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But they did not want to
talk about it at that time.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And now they're talking
about these things,

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
because it's critical
that we know it.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what they meant by that.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: There-- firstly,
what's interesting

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle line:84%
when they speak about what
they will and they won't say,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
they say we will only
give you information that

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.810 align:middle line:90%
will serve your progression.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we know
that a lot of people

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
will hear a certain thing and
go into fear or contraction.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
My sense of it is it's not
just that they are saying it

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's critical, but
I'm always paying attention

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:90%
to what they're willing to say.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I'm like,
oh, this is interesting.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.340 align:middle line:90%
This is new.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.895 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And then
lo and behold,

00:06:42.895 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
three months later,
I'll see an article

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:90%
that's saying a similar thing.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel like they time the
revelations that are necessary,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
but also as a confluence of that
revelation starts to happen.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.078 align:middle line:84%
So with some of the
things they're saying now,

00:07:00.078 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I know that the books will
come out a year or so later.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always interested
in, oh, in 2024,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.422 align:middle line:84%
when that third
book comes out, I

00:07:07.422 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
wonder what's going
on in the world

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that they're willing
to talk about this.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They haven't
gone into massive detail

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:90%
about why the clamp is there.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And they have even
said, there are

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.960 align:middle line:90%
other people whose job that is.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:84%
They said, and our
job is not to get

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
you too fixated on the
history of what happened.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But our job is to
remind you that it

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
happened, so that the
soul in you hears it,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:90%
recognizes it's true.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And rather than being
upset about it, angry about it,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
or fearful about
it, you recognize

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.760 align:middle line:84%
that our opportunity in
this short life we're

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:84%
going to have in
this body, is to do

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
our best to reclaim
that part of ourselves

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.600 align:middle line:90%
for us, and for everyone else.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfectly put.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Can't reclaim it, if you
don't know you've lost it.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: True.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.317 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I'm glad that
they are speaking about it.

00:07:52.317 --> 00:07:54.360 align:middle line:84%
But every one of
us is different.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't react with
fear to these things.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm of course, quite
curious as to what is it,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
so we can start figuring out
how we're going to address it.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And so now they're
talking about it,

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and people can start this
journey of addressing it.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things they wanted

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:84%
to talk about and do
talk about in this book,

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
which I'll talk to
them in specifics

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:84%
about the architecture, is to
really get it in our heads,

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and understand we are
multidimensional beings.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So why do they feel that
is so important, finally

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:90%
for us to grok?

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because
we have been trained

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
to see ourselves as linear,
and singular, and put ourselves

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:90%
in boxes.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you think about it, all
of us are multi-dimensional.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:84%
We're all a parent, a
child, a sister, a friend,

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:84%
someone who does
this for a living.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:84%
If you really look at the
roles you play in your life,

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:84%
all of us might play 20 to 40
different roles in our life.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So we already are operating
multi-dimensionally.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
The biggest problem with us not
seeing it and being discouraged

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
from seeing how connected
all of those roles

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.420 align:middle line:84%
are in our energy field, and how
that connects us to everybody

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:84%
in the same way, is
we-- we stay away

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
from what they
call oneness, which

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
is the thread of
connection that recognizes

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:84%
the equality and the simpatico
and harmony between us all.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
We've been designed
to stay as ourselves,

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and have what they talk
about as the war imprint.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:84%
They say that the war
imprint is so rife

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and is one of our
biggest issues.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:84%
It's been put there to divide
us, and to keep us separate,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and to cut us off, from our
spiritual connected nature.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:90%
And it has worked.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean we just saw
it working a lot

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.555 align:middle line:90%
in the last couple of years.

00:09:37.555 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're looking
at a structure

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that has been based on
competitive and predatory

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:90%
behaviors.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Get what you can for yourself,
then silo yourself off

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and protect what
you've got, so no one

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
can take it from
you, whatever it is.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a tenured
position at a university,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:90%
or whether it's food--

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:84%
a supply of food in an area
that's lacking food or water.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:90%
We do it everywhere.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.222 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The human is
doing it everywhere.

00:10:04.222 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And as they're saying, if you
look at us on a quantum level,

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.100 align:middle line:90%
you cannot separate us.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible if you saw
what we were energetically,

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:90%
we would all be shocked.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:90%
We would say, wait.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Where are we?

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't see anything.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.037 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing there, just
a few little sparks of light.

00:10:18.037 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And one
of the nicest things

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:84%
they said that really
hit me on a heart level

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and it was so clear,
it was a few years ago,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:84%
they explained none
of us are who we think

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:90%
we are because of ourselves.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
All of us are who we think
we are because of everybody

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're all influenced
by the person we just

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
had a conversation with,
the way we were parented,

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:90%
the teacher that influenced us.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:84%
We have melded and become
this multi-dimensional

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
representation of all
of our experiences.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.218 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
always reminding us,

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and I always feel this
when I channel them,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.500 align:middle line:84%
because I feel that state,
how connected we are

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.870 align:middle line:90%
and that's where our power lies.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.400 align:middle line:90%
Divided we fall.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Connected we thrive.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think many voices
have been talking about that

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:90%
this last few decades.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're at this
critical point, where we're

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:84%
witnessing the push-pull between
the forces that want to divide,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and separate us, and
control us, control

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and manipulation, and then the
future of the consciousness

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And they always say that
there are things going on

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:84%
inside the Earth that
we have no concept of,

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.833 align:middle line:84%
that are literally right
now emanating vibration up

00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:84%
through the surface
of the planet.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
So they say by all means,
look up and look out.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:84%
But they say so much
of our spiritual focus

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:84%
has been encouraged
to go higher.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And they said the Earth
is coming on line, in ways

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.515 align:middle line:90%
that we have never experienced.

00:11:44.515 --> 00:11:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's exciting.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, another area before
we go to the Z's,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
is all of this we're talking
about, having this higher

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.790 align:middle line:84%
understanding, planting
these seeds of consciousness

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.425 align:middle line:90%
and collaboration.

00:11:56.425 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
give timelines in a bit.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And we'll recognize
that we probably

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
won't be around to see
the fruits of a lot of it.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the absolute imperative

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that we understand that nothing
happens without this phase,

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:90%
right now of planting seeds.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:90%
There will be no fruits.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
There will be no change, if
we don't step up and plant

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:84%
the seeds, and have some
generosity to understand

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.348 align:middle line:90%
it won't manifest for a while.

00:12:23.348 --> 00:12:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's
interesting, isn't it?

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that you
often hear a parent speaking

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.540 align:middle line:84%
about the future in a way
that's very protective

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:90%
of their children.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't want my
grandchildren to grow up

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
in a world that looks
like X, Y, or Z.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet the truth is, if we
all were in our love field

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
for other people,
the way that people

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:84%
tend to become when it's
a parental relationship

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.750 align:middle line:84%
or a grandparent
relationship, if we all

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:84%
held that energy
for everybody, we

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:90%
would behave very differently.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a challenge
because it's very easy to go,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:90%
well, I feel love for everyone.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:84%
But the system isn't working
through those principles.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are a couple
of ways you can go with that.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:84%
You can either become
the most loving,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:84%
compassionate being
yourself that you can be,

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and let that affect the
world vibrationally,

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
or you can be one of
the people to attempt

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:84%
to go into some
of those systems,

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.507 align:middle line:84%
and lighten them up,
and brighten them up.

00:13:17.507 --> 00:13:20.007 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what the
new little ones being born now

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:22.900 align:middle line:84%
are here to do, to start
taking on that change.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at it even from
a self motivated point of view,

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
even if we say, yeah, well I
don't have kids or grandkids,

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:84%
If someone's being
self motivated,

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:84%
the fact is we reincarnate
back into this whole system

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:84%
we're setting up and
planting seeds for now.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.880 align:middle line:84%
We're actually laying the
seeds for our own futures,

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.770 align:middle line:84%
not just our
children, our friends,

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:90%
and the people we love.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We do.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.292 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting, isn't it?

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so joyous to
fertilize with your energy.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: With your
generosity, it's

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.330 align:middle line:84%
such a joy to be able to
extend yourself and connect.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think we weren't taught
that principle necessarily.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And yet the truth
is for any of us who

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
have our moments with that, or
a period of our life with that,

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
or we've dedicated
our life to it,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:84%
we know that the feeling of
connection and connectedness

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
that you get when you operate
from that standpoint, that's

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:90%
gold.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh it's--
that's pure joy.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It is.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
to the Z's about joy too.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, well thank you for
getting us all set up

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.440 align:middle line:90%
with some framework for this.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And let's go to the
Z's when you're ready.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Perfect.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then we'll talk
timelines and dimensions.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Good.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.270 align:middle line:84%
A pleasure to be here
with you once more

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and with all who are00 we will
say listening and receiving

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:90%
this transmission.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:84%
We would like to, before you
begin with your questions,

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
just point out that this
transmission in itself,

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.230 align:middle line:84%
this moment that you
are guiding, conducting,

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
facilitating, and that all
who are tuning in on it

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
are receiving and experiencing,
it is multidimensionality

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:90%
in action.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
It reconnects you to your
multidimensional place

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
within the universe, not
just within your human life,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:90%
your human identity.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:84%
It reminds you
that as a soul, you

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
are part of this wider
source field of energy.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself is the
practice that all of you

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
are, we will say,
undergoing at this time.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:84%
In order to emanate
from that place

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and live from that place
more, it does take practice.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.800 align:middle line:84%
It takes you giving
yourself to that energy,

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:84%
immersing yourself
in that energy,

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and gradually you will not
want to leave that energy.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what words
are said or information

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is given in this dialogue we are
about to embark upon with you,

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
the energy itself is
a transmission that

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:57.880 align:middle line:84%
reminds you of home, your wider
home, that which you incarnated

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:84%
from, and that which
you will return

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.870 align:middle line:84%
to when you leave
this specific body,

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and this specific identity
that you are in right now.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be with you again.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
It's funny when you say that
as we move through this,

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and we go into the other
dimensions of ourselves.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
I've always found it interesting
if on a personal level,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
say if I choose to go
up into another field,

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.740 align:middle line:84%
the funny thing is that a
lot of those attachments

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and those familiar,
sticky emotions and things

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:90%
aren't there.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can almost, if you're
interfacing with someone else,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:84%
it's almost there's
a disconnect,

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.385 align:middle line:84%
like you're not of this denser
Earth reality, when you go.

00:16:39.385 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
As you said you said, you would
never want to leave that place.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of times we leave
that place just so we can feel

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
like we're in some
sort of relationship

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:90%
with other people on Earth.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I know you can see what
I'm saying energetically.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.360 align:middle line:84%
You will all, each
of you, depending

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:84%
on what your we will
say life theme is

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:84%
or the life theme
you are working

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:84%
on that month or that
year, you will all

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:84%
engage with what
you refer to or what

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:09.400 align:middle line:84%
we would call as some of the
more gravity-based emotions

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.250 align:middle line:84%
that are specific
to being a human.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They do not exist in
our realm, and the realm

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.540 align:middle line:90%
that you originated from.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:84%
However, they are part
of the joy of being

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:90%
this multicolored human animal.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
wiring that you adopt

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:84%
when you come to
this place is to take

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:84%
on the psychological, emotional,
and vibrational energy field

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:84%
that your human ancestors up
to that point have carried.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And part of your job
is to lighten them.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, there
are many of you who

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.070 align:middle line:90%
will value your higher states.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But we would say to you that
enormous work takes place

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
for you and for the planet
when you are in, shall we say,

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
a conflict moment with someone
that you love very dearly.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And the two of you get into
your thoughts and your feelings.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And some of you, we
know look back on this,

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and think that you were
behaving in an unevolved way.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
But we would say no, no, you
were evolving the human way.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.660 align:middle line:84%
In that moment,
you were learning

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
to heal part of
the energy template

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:84%
that you not only came to
experience on a personal level,

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:84%
but that you came to upshift on
a level of mass consciousness

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.850 align:middle line:90%
for the planet as a whole.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So going in and out
of those states,

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:84%
it is, in fact, quite a
beautiful place to be.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you can stay
in what you call

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
the higher or elevated
or less emotionally dense

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
states with some
regularity, you are already

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.333 align:middle line:90%
doing your work on Earth.

00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure many people
will identify with that.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And here we call it
oftentimes people

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
who would prefer to
spend most of their time

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.760 align:middle line:84%
meditating and avoiding human
emotions, bliss bunnies.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot
of people watching

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:84%
that, I've been accused
of it too at times,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:90%
are bliss bunnies.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a good
reminder that we

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
need to feel the full
spectrum of our human emotions

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:90%
for this fascinating evolution.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We will add one piece
to your comment, if we may.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Remember too, that you are
all balancing the planet.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So the bliss bunnies
are, we will say,

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:84%
bringing balance to the
emotional rage machines that

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.500 align:middle line:90%
also exist on your planet.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So it is not better or worse
to be one way or the other.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But you will have what we
would refer to them as being

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
highly elemental
humans who are here

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.160 align:middle line:84%
more to be in the
ethers and the elements,

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:84%
and are a little less
adept with or experienced

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:90%
with human emotion and thought.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And they are here to bring
their own kind of balance,

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and to remind those who
get overly entrenched

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:84%
in the human density
that vibrationally there

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.410 align:middle line:90%
is another way.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.233 align:middle line:84%
And they will feel this when
they have this human standing

00:19:54.233 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
in front of them, even
though they can't quite

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:84%
put their finger on why their
energy field feels so light.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:84%
But they are a living example
of what is possible for you

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.132 align:middle line:90%
as humans

00:20:04.132 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
go just a little

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:84%
sideways here off of
what you've just said.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%
We're also delighted
when we're connecting

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:84%
with what we call our
spirits, angels, guides,

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and have these lovely
lighter influences come in,

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and give us useful information,
encouragement, and so forth.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But we're not as
delighted when we

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
feel entities that appear to
be coming from a denser realm.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
Earth as this place

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
that lives between
the high and the low,

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and the influences of
both on human beings?

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Well there are different--
we will call it

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:84%
if you like-- heights of
entities on the planet,

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:84%
just as there are different
heights of humans.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, the reason you
are all so delighted

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
when you connect to spirit
or shall we say overwhelmed,

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
is you are often
pushing through grief.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Because for many of you, even
if you are the most skeptical

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
minded, let's say you have an
experience with somebody who

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:84%
is a medium, a
bridge between you

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and a relative,
who has passed on.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And the skeptical mind
in you is slightly

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.180 align:middle line:84%
blown apart as they
relay information

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that your relative and
only you could have known.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:84%
What actually happens in
those moments of connection

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
for the skeptic or for the one
who loves the higher realms,

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.730 align:middle line:84%
is a moment of grief
gets burst in you.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Because all of you
are grieving the fact

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
that you are
separate from spirit.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Many of you have
managed to temper it

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
by making returning
to spirit your focus.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And so you no longer
feel in grief.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:84%
But it does mark you out
as a little different

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to some of the people
in your life, who

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:84%
do not visit spirit with
the regularity that you do.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps some of them because
of their skeptical trained fear

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit world, which
all of you were trained into,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
has an effect on them that makes
them uncomfortable, until they

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.250 align:middle line:84%
have a moment where they
feel the realm of the spirit

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.290 align:middle line:84%
back in their body, or
back in their heart,

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:84%
or back in the top of
their mind for a moment.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they
recognize they are home,

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:84%
even if they don't fully
understand the experience.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But to your point about
different layers of entities,

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:84%
it is the case that you
can have more, shall

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
we say, malevolent or
heavy entities that

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:84%
hang around certain human
beings who are also behaving

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:84%
in malevolent, or we
will say destructive,

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:90%
ways towards other humans.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:90%
However, we must say this.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:84%
It's important
you don't blame it

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:90%
all on the malevolent spirit.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.150 align:middle line:84%
That is a training that has also
been given to you, some idea

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:84%
that the spirit realm
is not to be trusted.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:84%
It is actually the human's
job to keep their energy

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:84%
field clear, and recognize
if they are, shall we say,

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
dancing with lower
energies in the actions

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.458 align:middle line:90%
they are taking on the planet.

00:22:59.458 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very well said.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much with that.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me that
it's the resonance.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:84%
As you say, if you're
in not a very good space

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:84%
or clean space yourself,
and struggling quite a lot,

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and have a lot of anger,
fear-- whatever's going on,

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.150 align:middle line:84%
you're almost
creating a resonance

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:84%
or a vibrational
bridge that allows

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.910 align:middle line:84%
you to go into the dance
with another denser entity.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.205 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part that
humans are responsible for.

00:23:22.205 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And also remember you have
all been asked to align

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.040 align:middle line:84%
with we would say these
human dense emotions that

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:90%
are not belonging to the soul.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.860 align:middle line:84%
This was part of what we
will call the implant that

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.492 align:middle line:84%
took place with humanity a
little over 10,000 years ago,

00:23:41.492 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:84%
although there are different
periods in history where

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:90%
different implants were put in.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot pinpoint it for you
exactly because there are many

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:84%
stories and events that
line up to, we will call it

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:84%
the limitation of the awakened
human soul that you were

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:90%
designed to be.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was a time
when Earth was designated

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:84%
as a planet where you were going
to see this evolved soul take

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:90%
place through human form.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there were
influences that did not

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:90%
want that to be the case.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they were able to,
we will say, interfere.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So what many of you
are dealing with now,

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:84%
when you are looking
at judgment or blame,

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.530 align:middle line:84%
is those original implants,
those what you would

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:90%
call emotional low vibrations.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And all of you have
probably experienced those

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.030 align:middle line:84%
at some time in your life,
and they are not yours.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.450 align:middle line:84%
They are borrowed
emotional energy fields

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:84%
that have been given to you
as a way of dealing with your,

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.050 align:middle line:84%
let's say, reactions
or emotions.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that all
of that can be transmuted,

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.140 align:middle line:84%
which is why at this time where
the consciousness on the planet

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:84%
is literally being raised,
whether you want it to or not,

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:84%
even with so many of the-- we
will call it an overt attempts

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:84%
to control, manipulate,
and hold humanity down,

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:84%
it simply cannot be
stopped at this point.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So as this consciousness
is raising,

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:84%
it is causing many more
people on the planet

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:84%
than ever before to
lean into the ability

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:84%
to heal, and go
beyond, and open out

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.090 align:middle line:84%
these very dense
fear-based emotions

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.840 align:middle line:84%
to do with blame, judgment,
anger, reactivity--

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:84%
what we would call the
war imprint that plays out

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:84%
inside you at small
emotional levels.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is why you are seeing
such a widespread proliferation

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
of emotional awareness,
healing techniques.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Society is going through a very
steep and sudden learning curve

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.570 align:middle line:84%
around re-identifying yourself
as the new human soul,

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and letting go of what the old
human soul was allowed to be.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On a
more mundane level,

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.010 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to these
dense emotions, there are--

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:84%
some people watching this even
have a family or ancestral

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.290 align:middle line:90%
culture of hanging onto worry.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Worry is almost
a badge of honor.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It brings a gravitas
to someone's life

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.730 align:middle line:84%
to worry about everything,
and worry about everyone.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But it seems that is not in
sync with what's going on

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.780 align:middle line:90%
and required right now.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:10%
Worry is one of the most
debilitating anxiety forms

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.780 align:middle line:10%
that you can have,
because worry tends

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.420 align:middle line:10%
to close you down to both
the present and the future,

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:10%
the two places
where potential lie.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Worry traps you in the past.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And it either is trapping
you in a past trauma,

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:40.070 align:middle line:84%
or it is a pattern of behavior
that you inherited and overly

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.250 align:middle line:84%
absorbed from a
member of your family,

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.960 align:middle line:90%
or someone who raised you.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.810 align:middle line:84%
However, we would like
to point this out.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And this is very important.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:84%
This is why it is very complex,
this path of awakening.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:84%
There are many times when
worry has protected you.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:84%
There are many times when
your fear has protected you

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:90%
from doing something too soon.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So we would say
if you notice you

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:84%
have a tendency
toward worry, look

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.110 align:middle line:84%
at your tendency
toward anxiety, and see

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:84%
what your anxiety
needs, which conditions

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:84%
has your anxiety never
had in life, that would

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:90%
help you feel less anxious.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Anything in your past
or any trauma history

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
you have that you could loosen
up by looking at it, but also

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that
these, shall we call it,

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:84%
lower points of focus, or
emotion, or energy for you

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:90%
are often perfect.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:84%
They put you in the perfect
place at the perfect time.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So the question
around your worry

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:84%
is, is this a chronic
emotion that I

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:46.100 align:middle line:84%
am feeling that is getting
in the way of my future,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:90%
and I need to look at it.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Or is this a tendency
I have, and so long

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.100 align:middle line:84%
as I stay aware of it,
and learn to manage it,

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:84%
it can also be a
good indicator to me?

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Ah, I'm worried.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I must be about to
do something big.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So now I will employ
my worry tools,

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
so that my worry doesn't
try and stop or sabotage me

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:90%
from taking this forward step.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:84%
It's an indicator, a
form of information,

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:84%
but chronic, it's a
problem if it's chronic.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go into--

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was fascinating--
in Lee's new book,

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.510 align:middle line:84%
where you were talking about
the architecture of dimensions,

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:90%
planes, and realms.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Because we kind
of use these terms

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:84%
very loosely and
interchangeably.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'd even throw
in vibration and frequency

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.580 align:middle line:84%
alongside dimension,
and we have a real soup

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:35.220 align:middle line:84%
of just a vague notion
of what's going on.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you can explain a
bit from your perspective

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.280 align:middle line:84%
about dimensions,
and how they actually

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.843 align:middle line:84%
live alongside one another, so
we can understand it better.

00:28:46.843 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you
wouldn't mind putting

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.770 align:middle line:84%
in the notion of
vibration and frequency,

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:90%
what creates a dimension.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Firstly, we
understand this notion

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:90%
of higher dimensions.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.140 align:middle line:84%
We understand why it
is in your language.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.730 align:middle line:84%
We understand why
it is in your focus.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And we understand
why so many people

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.490 align:middle line:90%
have used it as a benchmark.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.260 align:middle line:90%
And it has served its purpose.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.560 align:middle line:84%
What is actually
happening when someone

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.840 align:middle line:84%
says that they want to
live at a higher dimension,

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.360 align:middle line:84%
is more of the time than
not, they are saying,

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.307 align:middle line:84%
I want to escape this
lower stuff I am feeling.

00:29:18.307 --> 00:29:19.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be feeling this.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.015 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
be thinking this.

00:29:21.015 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So in the higher
dimension, I will

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:84%
be safe from all
of these feelings.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, there is
a truth to that.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
excavation work

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that you will have to
undertake to allow yourself

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to let go of the lower that
you identify with in order

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to be able to sustain a higher
vibration more of the time.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And a higher
vibration is what we

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:84%
would call your
state of being, what

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:84%
you are vibrating inside
yourself, what you

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.070 align:middle line:90%
are vibrating out to the world.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you are in
a high vibration,

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.030 align:middle line:84%
it might look like you feeling
at your most calm, open,

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:56.660 align:middle line:84%
peaceful, perhaps
joy, love is in there.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.180 align:middle line:90%
But they are not as necessary.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Joy and strong
feelings of love are

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:06.440 align:middle line:84%
what we would call peaks within
a baseline state of peace,

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:90%
calm, and openness.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:84%
That is a way of looking
at your vibration.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.035 align:middle line:84%
How long has it been since I
felt peace, calm, or openness?

00:30:15.035 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Ah, I need to work
on my vibration.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, when people speak
about dimensions,

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:21.950 align:middle line:84%
they tend to see it as
higher dimensions, this idea

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that the ninth dimension
is far above your heads,

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and you are stuck here on little
old three dimensional Earth

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.030 align:middle line:90%
trying to deal with it.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what we would
like you to consider

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:35.000 align:middle line:84%
is the dimensions are
all alongside you.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.660 align:middle line:84%
You can move into a dimension
through this human body

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.230 align:middle line:90%
of yours at any given moment.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you're with a
friend who's very depressed.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And the vibration that
they are pulsing out

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:51.770 align:middle line:84%
is one of heaviness and sadness,
because the dimension that they

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.990 align:middle line:84%
have aligned with
is their past trauma

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:84%
history, their past
old heavy patterns

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.450 align:middle line:84%
that they are not
able to move past.

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So you spend some time
in their energy field.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.120 align:middle line:84%
You connect with them for,
let's say 10, 15 minutes.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.910 align:middle line:84%
You are going to walk
away, and if you overly

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:84%
expanded into
their energy field,

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.372 align:middle line:84%
you are going to feel a
little dimmed in your own.

00:31:13.372 --> 00:31:15.330 align:middle line:84%
You will essentially have
taken on a little bit

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:90%
of their vibration.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It will have merged
with your own.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And depending on your
tendency, so let's say

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
you have a tendency
for depression,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and being in the dimension
of depression in yourself,

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
you might then start to fan
the flames of depression,

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and start to feel
quite depressed.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a contagious
energy, and you

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:84%
were just with someone who
gave you a little bit of it.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But if we then show you
that 10 minutes later,

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:43.560 align:middle line:84%
you have a conversation with
someone who is happy, and open,

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.610 align:middle line:90%
and joyous.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.070 align:middle line:84%
They are vibrating
at a different level.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.350 align:middle line:84%
They are in a
different dimension

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.880 align:middle line:90%
in order to attain that level.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, they had wonderful
experiences all morning,

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:59.280 align:middle line:84%
or they have been working on
keeping themselves uplifted as

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.890 align:middle line:84%
much as possible, and taking
good care of themselves.

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Then you are still in
this same human body

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:84%
encountering a different
frequency in this other being.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And that can put you into
a different dimension.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So we understand we need to
be even more clear about this.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:20.070 align:middle line:84%
For the words are to some
degree interchangeable.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it this way.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.670 align:middle line:84%
You speak to the
depressed person.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:25.860 align:middle line:84%
You start to feel
a little bit down,

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and the dimensional
doorways through which

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.360 align:middle line:84%
you could walk for
the next hour are

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.610 align:middle line:84%
going to be a bit more
limited, unless you become

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.500 align:middle line:90%
aware of what just happened.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Say, I release any energies
and emotions that are not mine,

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.860 align:middle line:84%
or you specifically
name this person

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.470 align:middle line:84%
that you recognize you just
picked some stuff up from.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Because of how
you are vibrating,

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.210 align:middle line:84%
there will be a certain
dimensional reality

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:90%
available to you.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:84%
This will somewhat limit the
experiences you can have.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:84%
You will magnetize slightly
lower frequency events

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.920 align:middle line:84%
until you realize you need
to let go of what you just

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.720 align:middle line:90%
walked through.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.160 align:middle line:90%
And this is all very subtle.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.430 align:middle line:84%
But equally, if the
person who is joyous

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that you meet 10 minutes later
again shifts your vibration,

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and you start to vibrate
higher inside yourself,

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:84%
the dimensional
doorways of your day,

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:20.280 align:middle line:84%
so the people you will meet,
the places your eyes will land,

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.250 align:middle line:84%
you will start to look for
that dimensional reality.

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So the vibration
is internal in you.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And what you are
seeking outside you

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.990 align:middle line:84%
is the dimensions
of reality that you

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:84%
wish to engage in that
relate to and resonate

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:90%
with your inner vibration.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:84%
But just a small shift
can alter the way

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that you focus on
your dimensions,

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.900 align:middle line:84%
the way that you
gravitate toward

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and attract toward yourself,
dimensional doorways that are--

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.290 align:middle line:84%
you would call it higher
rather than lower.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.120 align:middle line:84%
But what we are trying
to point out to you

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.130 align:middle line:84%
is that they are all
existing alongside you.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And they're
everywhere all of the time.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.350 align:middle line:84%
It is why you can
walk down a street

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and see one person in joy
and one person in misery.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions are all
around you all of the time.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is your focus,
your awareness,

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and your vibrational
state that will

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.130 align:middle line:84%
have enormous influence over
which dimensions you live in,

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:90%
and play with that day.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is,
most of you go through

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.409 align:middle line:84%
many different
dimensions, some of you

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:29.264 align:middle line:84%
within an hour, most
of you within a day.

00:34:29.264 --> 00:34:30.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautifully said.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
notion then of planes.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.389 align:middle line:84%
Now, we hear some of
the ancient texts that

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:39.330 align:middle line:84%
refer to what plane
we're living on

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.780 align:middle line:84%
with the Earth in the center,
whether it be 7 planes, or 12

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.380 align:middle line:84%
planes, or however many planes
that tradition recognizes.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying then that
the dimensions are running

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.860 align:middle line:84%
vertically, and we
weave in and out of them

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.590 align:middle line:84%
depending on our own
emotions and vibrations.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Then what is a plane?

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, we
would say to you,

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.440 align:middle line:84%
the plane of existence that
we are reaching you from

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.710 align:middle line:84%
is you could call it
horizontal, and we

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.960 align:middle line:90%
are lifted from your body.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So we are above the
Earth right now.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.590 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we are
somewhat in a bit of a trick,

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:17.370 align:middle line:84%
because you have a human
being doing his best

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.880 align:middle line:84%
capacity to translate
in human words, the--

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.640 align:middle line:84%
we will call it informational
pockets and packets

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.620 align:middle line:84%
that we are trying to
bring through to you.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So the plane of existence
that we exist in

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:32.760 align:middle line:84%
is not to do with the
gravitational field of Earth.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.240 align:middle line:84%
You are all in Earth's
gravitational field.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And there are only a small
number of planes of existence,

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.170 align:middle line:84%
meaning horizontal levels,
that you have access to

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:90%
because of that gravity field.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And that is as it should be.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So we tend to describe to
you and see it this way,

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.190 align:middle line:84%
the planes of existence
are horizontal in nature.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.640 align:middle line:84%
They are not
necessarily dimensions,

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.810 align:middle line:84%
but they are we would call
it vantage points from which

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:90%
you can observe.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So the reason that we are
able to, shall we say,

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.340 align:middle line:84%
zoom out for humanity,
is we are not

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.060 align:middle line:90%
encumbered by your learning.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.590 align:middle line:84%
We are not encumbered by the
game that you are playing,

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and the, shall we
say, soil that you are

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:90%
having to till and fertilize.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But we, from our
plane of existence,

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.710 align:middle line:84%
are doing what we
can to fertilize

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and till the energetic
soil above you, which is

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:84%
work for us too, and
is part of the work

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.210 align:middle line:90%
that we are having to do.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:38.250 align:middle line:84%
As the consciousness field of
the Earth expands and elevates,

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:42.420 align:middle line:84%
so too does it reposition us
and our relationship to you.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.420 align:middle line:84%
For just as with
Lee right now, we

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.650 align:middle line:84%
are his collective of, we will
call it, not only guide team,

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.650 align:middle line:90%
but soul brother and sisterhood.

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:84%
All of you have this you
all have not only allotted

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.740 align:middle line:90%
guides and teams around you.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are also what you
would call spirit beings,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.680 align:middle line:84%
or entities, or even
energies some of you

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.130 align:middle line:84%
like to use that are existing
in planes of existence

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:12.540 align:middle line:84%
all around you and above you,
that are working energetically

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.320 align:middle line:84%
on the frequency of the Earth,
even if they may not have any,

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.060 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, contact with
you in a direct fashion.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then
we're talking about how

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.910 align:middle line:84%
our own, not just their
influence on the Earth

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and working with Earth as
the beautiful entity and soul

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that she is, but our own
vibrations frequencies,

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.900 align:middle line:84%
what we're generating, will
have an effect on a given

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:90%
area collectively of the Earth.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was told once that
some of the Earth changes

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that were scheduled to
happen that Edgar Cayce spoke

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.680 align:middle line:84%
about, for example, some
of them would occur.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But many would be
averted depending

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:84%
upon the consciousness of
the people on the land.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is making
sense according

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:90%
to what you just said.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain how we feel and
interact is affecting Earth,

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and what she is
going to express?

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
we will tell you,

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and you alluded to this
earlier in part of a question,

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:84%
there are many on
this planet who,

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.780 align:middle line:90%
they are not here for humans.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.480 align:middle line:90%
They are in human form, yes.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But they are here to raise
the energy of the planet.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, there are also those
who are here for the elements,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.800 align:middle line:90%
and for animals.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But we are speaking specifically
about those who meditate

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and we will say
direct frequency.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of you call it doing energy
work or grid work on the land.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.960 align:middle line:84%
There are many on the
planet who are doing that.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Most you will never know.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:39.690 align:middle line:90%
You will never speak to.

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:40.980 align:middle line:90%
That's not their role.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.720 align:middle line:84%
They came here to have a
far more ephemeral existence

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.520 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:84%
It was not their time this
time to come back and get

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.310 align:middle line:84%
overly involved in
the game of humanity.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
those of you who

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:55.170 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to be right in the
heart of the game of humanity.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:58.770 align:middle line:84%
We would use you and Lee
as an example of this.

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.653 align:middle line:84%
That is part of your role, and
how you do your energy work.

00:39:01.653 --> 00:39:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And then there are all
of the people listening

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.830 align:middle line:90%
to this who are doing the same.

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:84%
So you will be within your
family groups and your friend

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.190 align:middle line:84%
groups right now,
saying something

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.630 align:middle line:84%
that will bring
awareness and will

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:16.050 align:middle line:84%
bring a shift to the
energy field of your group.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And that wildly affects
not only Gaia, but also

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.890 align:middle line:84%
the power structures
on the Earth.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.710 align:middle line:84%
It is true, and this
is important for you

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.420 align:middle line:84%
to understand,
especially those of you

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.300 align:middle line:84%
who feel a heavy heart
around what you see

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.280 align:middle line:90%
going on the Earth right now.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:36.510 align:middle line:84%
If we could show you how many
things have been averted when

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:41.250 align:middle line:84%
it comes to destruction,
you would be both horrified

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.680 align:middle line:90%
at first, and then relieved.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.300 align:middle line:90%
But you would be horrified.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Because you would see
some quite destructive

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:53.580 align:middle line:84%
both Earth based events,
and many man-created events

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that have been stopped, not
just in the last few years,

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.630 align:middle line:84%
but over the last
five or six decades.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
can go further back.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.930 align:middle line:84%
But this last five
or six decades

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.230 align:middle line:84%
has been critical,
because approaching 2024,

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:10.180 align:middle line:84%
was always a key marker
point for this planet.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
always knowledge

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:16.620 align:middle line:84%
that things would heat up as
you got closer to that moment

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.680 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.750 align:middle line:90%
So things have been averted.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.570 align:middle line:84%
But all of you,
and this is why we

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.640 align:middle line:84%
say working on your
own consciousness

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.360 align:middle line:84%
is vital, if you feel
disempowered by your systems,

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and you do not know how
to empower your systems,

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.660 align:middle line:84%
start empowering your
immediate system.

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Start figuring out
how you can live

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.740 align:middle line:84%
in a higher vibration
in your daily life,

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.770 align:middle line:84%
but also how you can give
that to others, how you

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:90%
can affect others in that way.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.070 align:middle line:90%
We will tell you this too.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.750 align:middle line:84%
We know there are
many out there who

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:50.130 align:middle line:84%
are frustrated by what we will
call the dark shadows in some

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.780 align:middle line:90%
of your systems right now.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.900 align:middle line:84%
It is going to get
easier, especially

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.480 align:middle line:90%
by the time you reach 2027.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.340 align:middle line:84%
It will be far easier to
permeate, uplift, and shift

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.800 align:middle line:84%
these systems, even though
right now the picture

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.570 align:middle line:84%
might look quite
different to that reality.

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So those of you who do feel
like crusaders for systemization

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:14.130 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, not
only are there already

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.850 align:middle line:84%
many people who have created
technologies and ways

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.710 align:middle line:84%
for the future that
you will be using,

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.630 align:middle line:84%
but that have not
yet had their time

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:middle line:84%
or been allowed to
be revealed, there

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.800 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
a wave of you who

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.160 align:middle line:84%
are going to become
more inspired as how

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:90%
to upshift these systems.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But you are waiting for the
cracks in the window to appear.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And they are going to appear
with rapid effect from 2023

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.550 align:middle line:90%
to 2027 onwards.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is, as they
call it, the darkest hour

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:90%
before dawn, so to speak.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.050 align:middle line:84%
One of those dark
moments before dawn?

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We will tell
you that the year of 2024

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:53.490 align:middle line:90%
could be your darkest yet.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And we say that not to
scare, simply to inform.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.810 align:middle line:84%
We also will tell you
timelines are not set.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:41:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So we can be somewhat
accurate within the next 5

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:08.040 align:middle line:84%
to 10 years, and marginally
accurate within the next 100,

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and everything after that
gets a little harder for us

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.530 align:middle line:90%
and we have to reassess.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:17.280 align:middle line:84%
We will tell you that what
we are seeing on the planet

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.920 align:middle line:84%
right now is it will
be heart energy that

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:25.150 align:middle line:84%
will alleviate how dark
things have to get in 2024.

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And we would implore all of
you listening and watching,

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:31.690 align:middle line:84%
if you ever have a
thought where you

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.360 align:middle line:84%
get annoyed at
your fellow humans

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:38.380 align:middle line:84%
for not waking up sooner,
for not getting it,

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:43.210 align:middle line:84%
if you are blaming them for
what you see as the demise of we

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:47.020 align:middle line:84%
will call it freedom or
liberty on the planet, stop it.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:50.600 align:middle line:84%
If you keep doing that, you
will not help or serve them.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Instead, what you have to
do is come from your heart

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and recognize it
is their fear that

00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.220 align:middle line:84%
has them locked in that
ideology and that emotion.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the more you can
come from love, awareness,

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom, and the more you
can find places and people where

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:10.630 align:middle line:84%
you can put that, there
will be a ripple effect.

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:15.520 align:middle line:84%
It only needs approximately
30% of this planet to be awake

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.120 align:middle line:84%
enough to even be
questioning what is going on,

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.360 align:middle line:84%
not certain of what is
going, on but questioning.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment we see you
at approximately a 25% to 26%

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:28.300 align:middle line:90%
moment.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.560 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
everybody thinks like you.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean everybody
has it all figured out.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But you are approaching
the 30% that

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.960 align:middle line:84%
is required for a faster wave
of consciousness to permeate.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So don't blame
another human being

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:45.040 align:middle line:84%
for not being what
you think they

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.790 align:middle line:84%
should be in order for humanity
to have a golden moment.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Start looking at yourself,
and asking yourself

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.270 align:middle line:90%
some tough questions.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Am I vibrating in a
way that is helping

00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to generate oneness, compassion,
kindness, wisdom, love?

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things that are
needed, because human beings

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.420 align:middle line:90%
like evidence.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
to hear a concept.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:07.150 align:middle line:90%
They want to see it.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:08.230 align:middle line:90%
They want to feel it.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.410 align:middle line:90%
They want to know it.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you stand in front
of them in your heart,

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:14.860 align:middle line:84%
in a compassionate way with
wisdom that makes sense

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:18.160 align:middle line:84%
to them, and they feel it, and
they see it, and they know it,

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.480 align:middle line:90%
they will believe you.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:23.000 align:middle line:84%
If you angrily
tell them concepts,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.250 align:middle line:90%
what are they going to hear?

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Anger.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.615 align:middle line:90%
The concepts will be lost.

00:44:27.615 --> 00:44:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here, here.

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.380 align:middle line:90%
You're on fire.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.997 align:middle line:84%
I'm having so much
fun with you today.

00:44:31.997 --> 00:44:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We are always
happy to be with you

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.290 align:middle line:84%
for you are an
ancient archivist.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And it is a joy to
see you playing out

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.970 align:middle line:84%
your role in such a
human way, and being

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:44.150 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic librarian for the
world in the way that you are.

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.948 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
thank you for that.

00:44:47.948 --> 00:44:49.490 align:middle line:84%
For the benefit of
the viewers I just

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:53.150 align:middle line:84%
want to say what you just
said around the year 2027.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.250 align:middle line:84%
This has come up in
other people's work that

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:58.910 align:middle line:84%
have had transmissions as
well, the fellow Ra who

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:04.700 align:middle line:84%
did human design, Richard
Rudd in his work also.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:08.925 align:middle line:84%
This is starting to come up
that 2027, they're saying,

00:45:08.925 --> 00:45:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and I would love your
thoughts on this,

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:13.280 align:middle line:84%
that this is an opening
energetically where

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.400 align:middle line:84%
a new type of human,
elevated human,

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.110 align:middle line:84%
is going to be start
coming in greater numbers.

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:21.380 align:middle line:90%
There are two sides to this.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So the elevated humans
are already here,

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and as many of
know, the children

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.560 align:middle line:84%
being born at this time
and in this last decade

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:35.360 align:middle line:84%
have been particularly affected
by these higher vibrations

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, which
is why so many of them

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:41.210 align:middle line:84%
are struggling to
find their place

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and their way in a
destabilizing world.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And those of you
who are parents,

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:47.420 align:middle line:84%
who are guardians
or teachers who

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.810 align:middle line:84%
are having to figure out
how to help these highly

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.762 align:middle line:90%
sensitive children, guess what.

00:45:52.762 --> 00:45:54.470 align:middle line:84%
You're figuring out
how to help yourself.

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:58.850 align:middle line:84%
They are simply representing
the part of you that was never

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:00.260 align:middle line:90%
allowed to be present on Earth.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And just as you are
having new beings

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:04.680 align:middle line:84%
coming in with this
level of consciousness,

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.680 align:middle line:84%
so too are you going
to go through quite

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.990 align:middle line:90%
the transformation, all of you.

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:11.780 align:middle line:84%
It's why so many of
you have felt exhausted

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and thrown around by the
energies in this last--

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:16.880 align:middle line:84%
particularly in these
last three years.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.340 align:middle line:84%
You were being asked
to drop density

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.990 align:middle line:84%
at a speed that is far faster
than you could possibly

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.790 align:middle line:90%
realize.

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Because all of you are
feeling the gravitational pull

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.110 align:middle line:90%
of this sun.

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And we have mentioned 2027.

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:31.670 align:middle line:90%
We will lay out a few dates.

00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:35.120 align:middle line:84%
We have spoken for quite
some years about the shift

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:40.280 align:middle line:84%
period of 2017 to 2024 being
a challenging time on Earth,

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.500 align:middle line:84%
a time on Earth where
the dark tide rises,

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.610 align:middle line:84%
so the lighter tides can
see it for what it is.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we will
say that your 2024,

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:54.020 align:middle line:84%
there are some
potentials in that year

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that could be quite
tough for many of you.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But notice what happens
to you when we say that.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:03.050 align:middle line:84%
If you recoil and go into fear,
you need to work with that.

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:05.780 align:middle line:84%
You need to understand
are taking something

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.790 align:middle line:84%
that we have said that
is somewhat amorphous,

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and hasn't given you
specific details,

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and your fear
response has inflamed.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So notice how fast that
fear response inflames

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:17.150 align:middle line:90%
to the unknown.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And recognize that's how so many
people over the last few years

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.570 align:middle line:84%
were able to be
guided into fear,

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and their fear became
the dominant emotion.

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:28.610 align:middle line:90%
They stopped thinking clearly.

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many went
to war with each other,

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:34.490 align:middle line:84%
because fear was pumped
across your world.

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So you're coming out of that
period now, and enough of you

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.960 align:middle line:84%
have learned what that period
was that you can be custodians.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.210 align:middle line:84%
That if a similar
scenario, and we

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.610 align:middle line:84%
don't mean in detail but
we mean in energetics,

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:49.070 align:middle line:84%
were to play out on
Earth, more of you

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:51.530 align:middle line:84%
will be a little
prepared for how

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:54.920 align:middle line:84%
to navigate this both
personally and for yourself.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:48:01.470 align:middle line:84%
The years between 2024 and
2027 have quite an arc to them.

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:03.590 align:middle line:90%
They are a little unpredictable.

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But what we will
say is there will

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:08.660 align:middle line:84%
be some wild energy
in those years,

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.132 align:middle line:84%
and there are many of you who
feel quite wild right now,

00:48:11.132 --> 00:48:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and you don't like the
control, and it irritates you.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And you want to see certain
things being overthrown.

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Wait with your wildness,
for your wildness

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.530 align:middle line:84%
will be put to good
work in those years

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:23.880 align:middle line:84%
where innovation will
be a little easier.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.180 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying it will
all be fully allowed.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But it will be harder to
squash in that time frame.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And it will take a swell
of these, again, things

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that people can see,
know, feel, trust--

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.100 align:middle line:84%
for them to understand,
ah, there was a better way.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.560 align:middle line:84%
No one had ever
allowed us to see it,

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.928 align:middle line:90%
or led us in that direction.

00:48:43.928 --> 00:48:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
will be many who

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:48.320 align:middle line:84%
will want to cling onto the
old, because it is known.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So that is why this is
such an important decade

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:52.250 align:middle line:90%
for all of you.

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:54.290 align:middle line:90%
But we would say one last thing.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And we don't mean to be
overly verbose in this answer.

00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.700 align:middle line:90%
But it is so important.

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.360 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself
getting all caught up

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.780 align:middle line:84%
in what's going on on the
planet, please remember you

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.430 align:middle line:90%
are going to die.

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:09.020 align:middle line:90%
You are going to die.

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.550 align:middle line:84%
You are going to
leave this body.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:12.410 align:middle line:84%
You are going to
leave this identity.

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:13.770 align:middle line:90%
It might be tomorrow.

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It might be in 70 years.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:17.610 align:middle line:90%
You are going to die.

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And this Earth school that
you are in is a school,

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and the more fixated
you get on your fear

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.080 align:middle line:84%
of your own personal
identity or bodily survival,

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.370 align:middle line:84%
the more trapped
you become here.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:32.680 align:middle line:90%
So pay attention to that.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also
the despair that

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:37.830 align:middle line:84%
has overtaken so many people
by feeling that events

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:39.300 align:middle line:84%
are literally out
of our control,

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.425 align:middle line:84%
that people are getting
away with things that we're

00:49:41.425 --> 00:49:44.280 align:middle line:84%
watching-- like watching
a robbery in daylight,

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.540 align:middle line:90%
and you can't do anything.

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Our hands are tied.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So that despair
and powerlessness

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that comes with
that, it seems to me

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:54.970 align:middle line:84%
are two of the critical emotions
that we need to transform.

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And what you are
seeing right now

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.990 align:middle line:84%
is a global awakening
around the lack

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:05.140 align:middle line:84%
of relationship between your
power systems and the people.

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.565 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And more
people are beginning

00:50:07.565 --> 00:50:08.880 align:middle line:90%
to see that than ever before.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
what kind of world

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.590 align:middle line:84%
do you want to live in,
a factory in which you

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:17.580 align:middle line:84%
are farmed, or do you want
to be a sovereign being

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:21.360 align:middle line:84%
in a collaborative
and connected place?

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of you may not
see that in your lifetime,

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.260 align:middle line:90%
depending on your age.

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But that is what you are
here to help usher in.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And some of you are here to
build the foundations of that,

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.200 align:middle line:90%
and that is enough.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You might not be the
one putting the roof on.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But you are going to be the one
to help build the new house.

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And why are you
interested in this?

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Why should this matter to you?

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Because why else
did you incarnate?

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.490 align:middle line:84%
You did not come to this planet
to play out old 16th century

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:50.540 align:middle line:84%
emotions and wounds, even
though you see those playing out

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.340 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And many of you run
a mile from them.

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.790 align:middle line:84%
There are some younger souls,
who for various reasons

00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:59.370 align:middle line:84%
have chosen to incarnate in
that energetic imprint, where

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:00.940 align:middle line:90%
the ancestry is concerned.

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:04.410 align:middle line:84%
But for most of you, that's
not why you came here.

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Finally,
if we can just

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:10.150 align:middle line:84%
get to the longer time frame
of the next 50 to 100 years,

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.870 align:middle line:84%
which is mentioned
in Lee's book.

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well firstly,
your galactic, not only

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:19.920 align:middle line:84%
origins but also connections,
will be fully known

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.820 align:middle line:90%
within that time frame.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So not only will this
idea of Earth and humanity

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:30.450 align:middle line:84%
as a species in place
by itself, disconnected

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:36.300 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of the
universe, be eradicated

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.970 align:middle line:84%
you will also be
having more of a--

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.040 align:middle line:84%
we will call it
galactic experience.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, your minds tend to go
to your traditional ways

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:47.290 align:middle line:90%
of viewing this.

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So you think of what
you have been shown,

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.980 align:middle line:84%
the spaceships or
the alien invasion,

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:56.230 align:middle line:84%
or those kinds of ideas will
float through your mind.

00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So be mindful of
what you interpret.

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.790 align:middle line:84%
We will tell you that you are
all in your galactic origin

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:03.840 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:07.350 align:middle line:84%
As a human soul, as
the new human soul,

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:84%
you are all in your
galactic origin.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And have you not noticed
how galactic information,

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:15.480 align:middle line:84%
galactic awareness,
and galactic--

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:20.070 align:middle line:84%
we will call it music, but
you would call it frequency

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and vibration, is permeating
Earth's consciousness more

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:24.610 align:middle line:90%
and more?

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
issues that you have

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:30.690 align:middle line:84%
is this war mentality of
separation and othering.

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:33.210 align:middle line:84%
If you are determined
that you are

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:36.960 align:middle line:84%
the right race, or the right
species, or the right gender,

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and that everyone else is less
than you, may God help you.

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Because you are going to
have one hell of a time

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.720 align:middle line:90%
in the coming 50 years.

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.810 align:middle line:84%
You are going to have an
almighty reckoning with some

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:52.890 align:middle line:84%
of those egoic and fixed
ideas and emotions.

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:55.350 align:middle line:84%
That is why you are
seeing so many people,

00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:57.720 align:middle line:84%
we will say, excuse
our language,

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.120 align:middle line:84%
lose their shit
right now, as they

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:04.890 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to have
things explode around them

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:06.720 align:middle line:84%
that they used to
rely on, and that

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.180 align:middle line:84%
used to support their
identity and their nature.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.750 align:middle line:84%
That is why you are seeing such
a fight playing out on Earth.

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So we will say
the next 50 to 100

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:19.170 align:middle line:84%
years is the moment where
Earth gets to reconnect

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:23.250 align:middle line:84%
with its galactic origins in
both energetic and psychic

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:28.620 align:middle line:84%
ways, but also some literal ways
that will help free many of you

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.370 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, or at least we will
say the human template that

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:34.710 align:middle line:84%
has been in existence,
including the way

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:38.910 align:middle line:84%
that you have treated animals
and nature historically.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:41.160 align:middle line:90%
All of that is set to change.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.540 align:middle line:10%
Because you cannot go to a
higher level of consciousness

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.950 align:middle line:10%
without eradicating and undoing
so many of these systems

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:53.730 align:middle line:10%
and fences that have been built,
that held the old consciousness

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:57.090 align:middle line:10%
in place, but that would only
limit the new consciousness

00:53:57.090 --> 00:54:01.090 align:middle line:10%
from arriving, and being
manifest in form on Earth.

00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:01.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I think you've left
everybody breathless.

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.200 align:middle line:84%
What a fascinating
body of information

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.490 align:middle line:90%
you've shared with us today.

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:10.198 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I could--
well, I'm giving you

00:54:10.198 --> 00:54:11.610 align:middle line:84%
a virtual hug for
all the passion

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:12.820 align:middle line:90%
you've brought to the table.

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And we'll let Lee come
back now until next time.

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you again.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: In peace
and in love to all.

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.680 align:middle line:90%


00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whoa.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Of all of the
channelings I've been

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.460 align:middle line:84%
present for that
you've done, wow,

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.710 align:middle line:84%
that was so much
powerful information.

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Because you can feel
now the forthrightness

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:38.820 align:middle line:90%
coming even more.

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like pay attention, people,
now and just really critically

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:45.550 align:middle line:90%
wonderful information.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for lending
yourself to this once again.

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's my job.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.800 align:middle line:90%
It's why I'm here.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.570 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you.

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we
extended about 10 minutes

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:55.590 align:middle line:90%
over our normal time.

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.500 align:middle line:84%
But that's OK, because
it was imperative

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.110 align:middle line:84%
that we let the Z's
explain all this to us.

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So Lee, any final
thoughts on your part

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.280 align:middle line:90%
before we say goodbye?

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.765 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I have no more words.

00:55:06.765 --> 00:55:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I guess you don't.

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I've got to go back and
watch this one myself.

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:13.560 align:middle line:90%
OK, Lee.

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:15.195 align:middle line:90%
I love you to pieces.

00:55:15.195 --> 00:55:16.153 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Love you too.

00:55:16.153 --> 00:55:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And until next time.

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:20.430 align:middle line:10%
