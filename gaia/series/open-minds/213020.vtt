>>REGINA MEREDITH: John Sandbach
has been a devotee of tarot

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.430 align:middle line:10%
for more than five
decades and says

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:10%
he's discovered even more
complex meanings in each

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:10%
of the cards.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:84%
The tarot archetypes
are in essence

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:84%
a tool of communication
between you

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and your guides or realms
of being surrounding us.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:84%
He's going to share with us
how to engage in the best way

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:84%
to get the clearest
communication from your guidance

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:90%
through your tarot cards.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN SANDBACH: I'm so
happy to be here, Regina.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm glad
to have you here.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We've had lovely conversation
off-camera about our shared

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:90%
passion for color.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.858 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
meaning of color.

00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Vibration of color.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Healing power of color.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And we'll add a
little bit of that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:84%
into the conversation, which we
hadn't planned because everybody

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.780 align:middle line:84%
watching this, I'm assuming,
has a direct relationship

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:90%
with color.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.872 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we go into it,
so people can get to know you

00:01:02.872 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:84%
a bit, how did you
originally become

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:84%
so intrigued with and
ultimately engaged in the tarot?

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well, I
had been an astrologer

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:90%
for maybe six or eight years.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And I came across CC
Zain's book, "The Sacred Tarot."

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And it just resonated with me.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:90%
I just felt the truth of it.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And I just
became obsessed with it.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And I read it over
and over and over.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And in his book he synthesizes
mathematics, numerology,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:84%
astrology, tarot, color,
all these different things,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:90%
he puts them together.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.660 align:middle line:10%
And so it really enriched
my astrology practice

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:10%
because it gave me new
insights into all the planets

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:10%
and signs via the tarot cards.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:10%
And so as time went on, I
started teaching astrology

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.780 align:middle line:10%
and then I started
teaching tarot classes.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:10%
And then Ron Ballard and I, we
wrote a correspondence course

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:10%
in the tarot and marketed that.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And then later, we put that
whole correspondence together

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
in a book that was
called "The Golden Cycle,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.857 align:middle line:84%
A Text On The Tarot," which was
the first version of the book

00:02:24.857 --> 00:02:27.065 align:middle line:84%
that we have today, "Soul
Journey Through The Tarot."

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Wow, OK, so that's
kind of a progression

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time--

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes, it is.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to
get to this point.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: It's been
over 50 years, yes.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But tarot itself has
a longer progression, so let's

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.628 align:middle line:84%
just get into a bit of the
history because, you know,

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
almost everybody says, oh,
the tarot came from Egypt.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I would argue it
came from somewhere far distant

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:90%
and went other places.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:90%
So tell us your take on it.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have psychic
images that have

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
come to my mind about
certain things and places.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
One of them has to
do with the Kabbalah.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
The major book of the
Kabbalah, in fact,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
the groundwork text
of it is the "Zohar."

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And the "Zohar" is
22 volumes long.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a very big book.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And those 22 volumes correspond
to the 22 cards of the Major

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Arcana in the tarot.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And the vision I've had is
that in the city of Fez,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
there were scholars and
wise people connected

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
with the Kabbalah who decided to
put together a visual "Zohar."

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And so they came up with
the cards of the tarot.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how those cards
ended up going to Italy

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:84%
because the earliest
tarot decks we know of

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
are from Italy in
the 14th century.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.577 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we know
it precedes that.

00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Oh, yes.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean, some
would argue that it actually,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
as with what ultimately
became the cards of destiny,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:84%
which is based on four suits
in a playing deck and numbers

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:90%
as well--

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that those
were all Atlantean systems,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
esoteric systems that kind
of made it out to Europe,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.332 align:middle line:90%
and you say to Mexico as well.

00:04:15.332 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: I
believe that is true.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And I think
one way of expressing

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
what the purpose
of the tarot is is

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:84%
that it is taking the
sequence of numbers

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and revealing how that sequence
expresses spiritual truth.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the pictures
are expressing

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
those spiritual truths
in symbolic form.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is there a specific
meaning in the number 22 then?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Oh, yeah.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
that just as we go into this.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, 22 in the
tarot is the only card

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:90%
that has two numbers.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's numbered 0 and
it's numbered 22.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the CC Zain system, 22
is Pluto, the planet Pluto.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And Pluto signifies
transformation.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So the purpose of the
tarot is to transform.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And you know, what we're
all doing here is evolving.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the most important
thing we're doing here

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:90%
on this planet Earth.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And so as we tune in
to the force of transformation,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to move
through the changes that

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:90%
lead us to enlightenment.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:90%
And so you take it--

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is part
of the soul's journey

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
is the way you view
the use of tarot--

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.498 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Absolutely.

00:05:44.498 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --is it an
opportunity for the soul

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and those intermediaries
who can help

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
speak, between the soul
and our conscious mind

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
to give us guidance
and information?

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that guidance
comes in all sorts of ways.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.415 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And I
think so often, we're

00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
experiencing guidance when we
don't even consciously know

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:90%
it's happening.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm,
I think so as well.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think one of the
major arts of living

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to attune to that
guidance, to be able to feel it,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and then to get
on that wavelength

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and go with wherever
that wavelength takes us.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we come
to your book, right?

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And you stayed in there
that, originally, these cards

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.640 align:middle line:90%
didn't have any images on them.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.690 align:middle line:84%
They were originally
sequences of numbers.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so talk about
the original decks of cards

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:90%
before the imagery.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll talk about why
you chose Egyptian iconography

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:90%
in yours.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: I like
the cosmic quality

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:90%
of the Egyptian iconography.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was trying to
resolve an astrological problem

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:84%
connected with what's called
mundane astrology where you--

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
like, what place are we
going to use on Earth

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:90%
to symbolize the whole Earth?

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And what I
came up with was Giza.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And as my friend Ellias
Lonsdale the astrologer says,

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Giza is a place for the
entry of stellar wisdom, star

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:90%
energy into the Earth plane.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So I chose the
Egyptian iconography

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
because it reflects that
star energy, that very high

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:90%
cosmic eternal quality.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But initially,
no images at all.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Right
because if you get

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:84%
down to what's the purest thing
in the tarot, it's the numbers.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here we have
a system based on numbers

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and numbers are orderly
and some people would say,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:84%
a lot of physicists would say,
and even quantum physicists

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
might say that numbers
and what they create,

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:90%
geometry and so forth form--

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
are the building
blocks when coupled

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:90%
with consciousness of life.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:90%
So that makes sense.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're expressing
something very pure.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Yes, it
definitely makes sense.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now tell us
originally what the suits were.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.185 align:middle line:84%
I guess, would
you call it suits?

00:08:11.185 --> 00:08:11.985 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:08:11.985 --> 00:08:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, the suits
were with the cards.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: OK, so we
start counting 1, 2, 3.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And 1, 2, 3, those
numbers are prime numbers.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.345 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: They can't
be divided by anything

00:08:22.345 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:90%
else except themselves and 1.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.240 align:middle line:84%
The first number we encounter
that is not a prime number is 4.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the tarot,
there are four suits.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.190 align:middle line:90%
And the suits signify elements.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the elements go from
the finest to the densest.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:84%
Fire is the finest
element and signifies

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:90%
creativity and spirituality.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the suit of
coins, which is the air suit.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a conflict over
that I can talk about later.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:84%
But the air suit is
the suit of the mind

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and it's the suit
of connectiveness.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The connection between
anything and everything, OK?

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And so the suit of air, which
is coin, signifies thinking.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Then we have the suit of cups.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the suit
of the emotions.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one thing I've
been thinking about a whole lot

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
lately is, you know,
there's really--

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:84%
all emotions except
for one are illusions.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And the one emotion that's
not an illusion is love.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: All other
emotions stem from love, even

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:90%
the negative emotions.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like fear
of loss of love.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah, fear,
anger, frustration, sadness,

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:90%
all these things--

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are
separations from love.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly,
separations is the best way

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:90%
to express that really.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.123 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Then
the final suit is

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:84%
the suit of swords, which is the
Earth suit, the densest element.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.350 align:middle line:84%
It signifies all that
is substantial, all that

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.940 align:middle line:90%
is here and stable, matter, OK?

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And those numbers, in
my system of the tarot,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.040 align:middle line:90%
run between 65 and 78.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we have the
architecture of your deck.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here when you
chose the Egyptian deck,

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:84%
are there other
people that have used

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.955 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian iconography
in there books as well?

00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Well, CC Zain did.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.033 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, CC Zain did?

00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's what
the inspiration was?

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah, it was.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And I
think he even called

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:90%
his deck the Egyptian deck.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.927 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you this before we
start drilling down into tarot

00:10:36.927 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
specifically because a lot of
people at this point are saying,

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:84%
oh, but I have a
fairy deck and I have

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:90%
a kiddie deck or a doggy deck.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And all of these wonderful
many, many people

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.752 align:middle line:84%
have created decks that are
more called oracle decks.

00:10:49.752 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: A voice
just said to me

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
the angels will use
whatever you got.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They'll use-- so
if a person is into kitties

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and their guides are
speaking to them,

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:84%
they can legitimately
offer guidance

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.307 align:middle line:90%
through their own oracle decks?

00:11:03.307 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all of
them have this kind

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:90%
of spirit imbued in them.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.540 align:middle line:84%
But is there
essentially a difference

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.900 align:middle line:90%
between tarot and oracle decks?

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well, the
one thing you always

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:84%
have to have in a
tarot deck is 78 cards.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: That number
is very important

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.335 align:middle line:84%
and I could go
into why, but it's

00:11:21.335 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:84%
kind of technical
with mathematics.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:90%
But it's very interesting.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Oracle decks can
have different numbers of cards.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And I think oracle
decks can be used, of course,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
to connect with angels
and nature spirits--

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: --and teachers of
wisdom who are enlightened,

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:90%
the bodhisattvas.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.698 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes
sense because, I mean,

00:11:43.698 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
if you're the
person that created

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:84%
the deck based on angels
or kitties or anything

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:84%
that you love and
profoundly resonate with

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and someone's coming to you
that also resonates with that,

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.140 align:middle line:84%
you're in harmony
with the-- each other.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So this brings an
initial harmony

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you can work on
your guidance together.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think if my
deck as being separate,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I would go to a person
that uses the kitty deck

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'd say let's look
at what you're doing

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and I want to help enhance
what you're already doing.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: You know,
help bring more wisdom

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and understanding into what
you already have tuned into.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, OK.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to go
into the history of the deck

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:84%
as most of us see it
because some of us

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.453 align:middle line:84%
don't resonate with
tarot for a reason.

00:12:26.453 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do--
what was it called?

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
The Rider-Waite deck,
the original deck

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that most people
are familiar with.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a bit of the history
of it, how it was illustrated,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and just take it away why you
don't resonate with some of it,

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and why some of us
are afraid of them.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well, we
start from the principle,

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:90%
there are no bad or good cards.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Any card in
the tarot, the energy of it

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.630 align:middle line:84%
can be used in a negative
way or a positive way,

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.800 align:middle line:84%
just like a knife can
be used to cut out

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
an appendix that needs to be
taken out or can murder someone.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: So the problem
with the weight deck

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.110 align:middle line:84%
is they portray some cards
as negative and other cards

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:90%
as positive.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDBACH: And
sometimes the imagery

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:10%
they use on these cards is
very grim, is very scary,

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.910 align:middle line:10%
or has a feeling of
disaster about it.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How was that--

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.290 align:middle line:10%
I mean, was that the preference
of the creator of the deck?

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDBACH: No.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:10%
Arthur Edward Waite was very
focused on the Major Arcana.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.660 align:middle line:10%
He was very concerned about the
symbology of those cards, which

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:10%
are 22 in number.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.170 align:middle line:10%
The 56 Minor Arcana
cards, he allowed

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:10%
Pamela Colman Smith, an
artist, to design those cards.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And when she went to
get feedback from him

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:90%
on, how do these look?

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.903 align:middle line:10%
I've finished these cards
and whatever, he just

00:13:54.903 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:10%
said, oh, you do whatever
you want with those.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm not really interested
in those cards.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm only interested
in the Major Arcana.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But she must have
had her own esoteric training

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.015 align:middle line:84%
or understanding or belief
system she brought to the table

00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:90%
in illustrating them.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd like to
look into her background

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.853 align:middle line:90%
and know more about--

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who she was.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah,
who she was and how

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:90%
she thought and like that.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it ended
up with this deck that

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:90%
has some pretty scary images.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:84%
I know I didn't resonate with
tarot because I don't want

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:84%
to see a person being stabbed
with swords and a skull of death

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.660 align:middle line:90%
and I don't want to see that.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:90%
I just don't like those images.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.530 align:middle line:90%
They're a little traumatizing.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.645 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Yes, I
make jokes about how--

00:14:37.645 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
so the scariest card
in that Waite deck

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
is the man laying face
down with a black sky

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and he has 10 swords
stuck in him in a row.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.512 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And I call
that the acupuncture card.

00:14:49.512 --> 00:14:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And I
want to redo that card

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:84%
where it's a man laying face
down like he's in a spa.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.798 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And he has
these little acupuncture

00:14:57.798 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:84%
needles stuck in him
and they're glowing,

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:90%
lights coming out of them.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:90%
I think that'd be beautiful.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the point
is that a lot of people

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:84%
are turned off because
of these images.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Oh, yeah.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.322 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because,
regardless of what

00:15:09.322 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
the person is about
to say to you,

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you're seeing
something that represents

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:90%
death or maiming or separation.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and so
that's not really necessary.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: No, not at all.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
chose to, in your cards,

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:90%
eliminate that kind of imagery?

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course, another card
like in the Major Arcana

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.620 align:middle line:84%
is the one in which in the
Waite deck is called the devil.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yeah.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well, the
devil, his horns have to do,

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I feel, with that ancient
Celtic god Cernunnos, which was

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient feminine-based
nature religions

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:84%
of Europe that
predated Christianity.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And Cernunnos,
of course, had horns.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the Christians, wanting
to defame those old religions--

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: --turned
him into Satan.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And so here it is,
it's still haunting us.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And so in my deck, he's called
the musician and he has--

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
from the waist down, he's
a goat, like, a satyr,

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and he's playing
the Pan's pipes.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And when he plays
the Pan's pipes,

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:84%
all the different notes
harmonize together

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:90%
to produce all of nature.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is the
essential meaning of that card?

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:84%
You put your imagery on
it that it represents

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:84%
the notes of nature,
normally in tarot, what

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:90%
does the devil card represent?

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Limitation and--

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, how do
you square your card

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:90%
with limitation?

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well,
according to Kabbalah,

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
the most spiritual
thing in the world

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:84%
is limitation because,
you know, Regina,

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:84%
we're sitting here right
now with each other

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and we only have a
limited amount of time.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And in not that long,
we're both going to die

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to pass
on into other forms.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.079 align:middle line:84%
So we're very limited
now in time and space.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And so limitation compresses
the light and intensifies it.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And so restriction--
the purpose of restriction,

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.329 align:middle line:84%
all the seemingly bad
things that happened to us,

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:90%
we can learn from them.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:84%
They concentrate and focus
our spiritual energy.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
that card is about.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I think
it's depicted as the devil

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.967 align:middle line:84%
is because no one
likes limitation.

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
would make sense.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.467 align:middle line:90%
That would make sense.

00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Nobody likes limitation
because it creates

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:90%
resistance and friction.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And you have to find a way
to either flow with it,

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:84%
work around it, try
to crash through it.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Yes, but we
learn two major things

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.940 align:middle line:90%
about limitation as we grow.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.397 align:middle line:90%
Number one is it's an illusion.

00:17:51.397 --> 00:17:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES] Yeah.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.355 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And number
two is it's temporary.

00:17:54.355 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is temporary.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:90%
But that's--

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And so actually,
limitation has its own beauty.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: That card
is ruled by Saturn.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And in the
Indian system of astrology,

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is thought of as the
most spiritual of the planets.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in Western
astrology, you hear Saturn

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and people want to run and pull
their covers over their heads.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Oh, they call
it the greater malefic.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about this
misunderstood nature of Saturn

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is always pushing us
toward greater spirituality

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and there's a very big tension
between that and materialism.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And so materialism, we get
focused on our attachments, OK?

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Saturn teaches us to
let go of attachments.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.473 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: And Saturn is kind.

00:18:50.473 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you about a
really strange thing that

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.265 align:middle line:84%
happened to me that was really
one of the most wonderful events

00:18:55.265 --> 00:18:56.422 align:middle line:90%
of my life that was recent.

00:18:56.422 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it have
to do with Saturn?

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes, it does.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please, tell.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Oh, yes, I was
in a car, in a limousine

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and there was a Black man
with a top hat standing.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And he needed a ride
and he had a cane.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And I waved to him, I said,
we could give you a ride.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And he got in the car
and it was Baron Samedi.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you know who that is?

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:90%
Who is this?

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.607 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: He is an Orisha
of the voodoo religion.

00:19:20.607 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: He is Saturn.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Samedi
means Saturday.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And Saturday
means Saturn's day.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDBACH: And he was so
kind with me in that dream,

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.875 align:middle line:10%
so gentle, so
supportive, you know?

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that he impressed

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:84%
upon me was that,
you know, we're

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:84%
not meant to reach
perfection this moment.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: We can do
it at our own pace.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing is
that we keep focused on it.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what's really important,
that we don't lose that focus.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So without a little
bit of pressure and restriction,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.690 align:middle line:84%
limitation, we probably
wouldn't bump up

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:84%
against those parts of ourselves
that we're trying to transform?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:06.893 align:middle line:90%
And you know what happens?

00:20:06.893 --> 00:20:09.140 align:middle line:84%
If we get that pressure
from the restriction

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:90%
and we kind of ignore it--

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it'll
show us another way.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.418 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Either that and/or
the pressure will get more.

00:20:15.418 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: It'll push harder.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: So if you
don't want to be pushed on,

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:90%
just keep evolving.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the devil
shows up in your deck

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:90%
if you've had a reading.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So basically, this is
to say pay attention,

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.530 align:middle line:84%
there's an area we
really need to focus on.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And it could say too there
could be hardships here

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that you're moving
through, but you know,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.640 align:middle line:84%
there's something to be
learned from these hardships.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: So try to
be open to learning.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Let the
learning happen.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Be accepting of the
hardship and that's

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.410 align:middle line:84%
the very thing that
ultimately will dissolve it.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.187 align:middle line:84%
So this is a good lesson
on Saturn in general.

00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: I love Saturn.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES] So what
other cards do you particularly

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.115 align:middle line:90%
love in the deck?

00:20:59.115 --> 00:21:01.740 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDBACH: Oh, you know, first
thing that always comes to mind

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:10%
is the star.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:10%
I love that card.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.510 align:middle line:10%
It's the naked woman pouring
water onto the land--

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDBACH: --and into the lake.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:10%
And in the star--

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.490 align:middle line:10%
in the sky above
her is eight stars,

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:10%
seven little ones, and then one
big one right over her head.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:10%
I heard this wonderful
lecture on that card one

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:10%
time that was very--

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:10%
made a deep impression on me.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:10%
And what the person said was
that that star above her, what

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:10%
that is, is the imagination.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How beautiful.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDBACH: And all
those other seven stars

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:10%
are the forces of, like,
astrology and reality

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:10%
that are always reacting on
us and pushing and pulling

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.800 align:middle line:10%
on us in different ways
and doing different things.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And the point of it is, if we
give in to just those forces,

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:90%
we're giving in to fate.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: We're
being fatalistic.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.122 align:middle line:84%
But the big star up
there is our imagination.

00:22:00.122 --> 00:22:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which has
to do with free will.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And through free will and
through our imagination,

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:84%
we can overcome the
limitations of fate.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.257 align:middle line:90%
That's what that card is about.

00:22:11.257 --> 00:22:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And it's
ruled by the sign Gemini.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
would the card be

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that you would most
often encounter

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
if it was time to
make a change and you

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:90%
were being invited forward?

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well,
actually, I'd say

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.640 align:middle line:90%
there are five cards like that.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: One is, of
course, the Arcanum 22,

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.920 align:middle line:84%
which you brought up,
which is called the fool.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the aces
are all four ruled

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:84%
by Pluto as well as Arcanum
22, so the aces of the tarot.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And their point
is it's time for change?

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.275 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:22:48.275 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and just in case
people have their deck out

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and they're playing with
it while we're talking,

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get
into a few of these.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:84%
What's the opposite
of that one to say

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:84%
stop, take stock, don't have
rapid forward movement right

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:01.450 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.720 align:middle line:90%
What would those cards be?

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Oh, they
could be the swords.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.792 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: The
swords are like that.

00:23:07.792 --> 00:23:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And also the tens are
like that in a sense.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:90%
And of course, the Saturn card.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the Saturn card.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we're going to try
to find a deck for ourselves

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to start
playing with it, right?

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of
all, where do we go?

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have your deck, right?

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.243 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where do
you go if you don't

00:23:27.243 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:84%
want to have those devil
cards and the scary cards?

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: The CC Zain deck--

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: --is very good.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: CC Zain.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.508 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: It's called
the Sacred Tarot.

00:23:35.508 --> 00:23:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think it might be
called the Egyptian Tarot too.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well, everybody
will be online, looking it up.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.740 align:middle line:90%
All right, so there you go.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And so you can start playing
with it yourself a little bit?

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I don't get
out and look at tarot decks

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:90%
that much.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: I'm not that aware
of all the different ones,

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: I like this
deck, but it's very extreme.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell me why
it's-- first of all,

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I looked at it before we started
rolling here and it's all

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:90%
abstract form and color.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they've taken
out all human imagery out of it.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: You know, so
you can see some of these.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was an artist,
a Norwegian artist

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:90%
named Hilma af Klint.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.690 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDBACH: And her paintings
are very, very metaphysical.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.630 align:middle line:10%
And now what they're saying
about her is her work

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:10%
predates all those abstract
artists that supposedly

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.310 align:middle line:10%
started the abstract movement.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well,
they were all men.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Her art was not given much
attention at the time, I think,

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:90%
mainly because she was a female.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure, of course.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So now it's being
given great attention.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And these two women
in New York, they

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:53.185 align:middle line:84%
have channeled her energy
to design these 78 cards.

00:24:53.185 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You look at
it and you think, gosh,

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.935 align:middle line:90%
where does one begin?

00:24:55.935 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:84%
But it does have a
title for each card.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, you changed
some of the names of cards.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: I do
change the names--

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.028 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like the
devil to the magician.

00:25:03.028 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So on a deck like this,
it's like there's nothing

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:90%
that could startle anyone.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: No, uh-uh,
no, they're very soft.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.037 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're very soft?

00:25:12.037 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:84%
But you say this is
kind of a radical deck.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.248 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well, in that it's
the only deck I know of that

00:25:17.248 --> 00:25:19.073 align:middle line:90%
does use complete abstraction.

00:25:19.073 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
geometry and color?

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just, yeah,
pure frequencies.

00:25:22.385 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes, exactly.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the
things about tarot--

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:84%
before we get into having you
give us some guidance of how we

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:84%
start engaging with our own
deck and learning and using

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:84%
our intuition,
before we get there--

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.480 align:middle line:84%
is the notion you talk about,
which is that time is--

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.380 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter if it's a
psychic reading or what

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's your own tarot
reading by yourself or others,

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.890 align:middle line:90%
time is always an issue.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot
of people want to know

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.060 align:middle line:84%
when, when is this
going to happen?

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is really
quite difficult.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.895 align:middle line:84%
But you say you can
kind of get indications.

00:25:55.895 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well, Baron
Samedi's laughing right now

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and he's saying, when you
make it happen, that's when

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:00.660 align:middle line:90%
it's going to happen.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: So go there
and make it happen.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:90%
When do you want that to happen?

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah, or when
will you be ready for it?

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:90%
So time can be an issue.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.363 align:middle line:90%
So don't say next week.

00:26:11.363 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Is this going to
happen next week?

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.660 align:middle line:84%
That's not a good-- there are
other do's and don'ts too as you

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.680 align:middle line:84%
start playing with the cards,
which is certain questions like

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:90%
you don't really ask yes and no.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.100 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a
waste of the cards.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.058 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: It is, yes.

00:26:24.058 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about how
you start talking with the cards

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.620 align:middle line:84%
because the formation
of the questions

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:84%
is probably more
important than anything.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Questions like, what do I
need to know right now--

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.218 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: --or
what would be good

00:26:37.218 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:90%
for me to focus on right now?

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.605 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Those are
excellent questions.

00:26:40.605 --> 00:26:41.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:26:41.405 --> 00:26:45.217 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Or what am I
learning from this because, you

00:26:45.217 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:84%
know, the beauty of
that one is if it's

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.320 align:middle line:84%
something you don't like, if
you learn what you need to learn

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:90%
from it, it'll go away.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: The
lesson will go away

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.060 align:middle line:90%
when you don't need it anymore.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.561 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All right, so the way
you ask your question, so when--

00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:04.015 align:middle line:84%
like I write down here,
you say in the book, like,

00:27:04.015 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:90%
will I get married?

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Now tell us how
someone could better

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
ask a question like that, that
would serve the answer-- where

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:84%
the answer would really
serve them in a deeper way.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: I start
talking to them and I say,

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.610 align:middle line:90%
well, are you dating anybody?

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Or you know, like that.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they'll tell me that
they've been looking for someone

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:90%
and just haven't found it.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And so then maybe I
might ask the cards,

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:84%
what is the vibrations
around this situation?

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
maybe what comes up

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:41.280 align:middle line:84%
is there's somebody there
that you're destined to meet,

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:84%
destined to marry,
but it's all--

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.080 align:middle line:90%
the time is not right yet.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes might it be
there's something in yourself

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be resolved?

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're alone, it's
because you need to be alone.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
another thing I might

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
do is I might ask the question,
what is this person learning

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:90%
from being alone?

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Because once again,
if they learn

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:84%
what they need to learn from
it, they won't be alone anymore.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: The
situation will go away.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if someone would
ask even the more direct

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.960 align:middle line:84%
question like, why
have I not connected

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:84%
with my partner or my
true companion yet?

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:84%
That might be a fair
question to ask?

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
sometimes what happens

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.920 align:middle line:84%
is I'll end up asking that
person some question that

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:84%
seems off the subject or I don't
even know why I'm asking it.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:90%
And things will happen.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Like they'll burst into tears.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And it's
almost like, great, there

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:47.030 align:middle line:84%
was this spark that ignited
and now all these emotions come

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:84%
pouring out,
surrounding this issue.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And so that can
often be a very powerful

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.520 align:middle line:90%
clearing--

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.427 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:56.427 --> 00:28:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: --a
clearing of the energy

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:02.470 align:middle line:84%
that then makes way for
what they're looking for.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
other hand, we have

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:84%
to remember because
there is free will.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.090 align:middle line:84%
this is what I always
find interesting, is when,

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through psychic
readings or tarot readings, when

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.700 align:middle line:84%
a person is asking
about something having

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:84%
to do with another person
or a group of people

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.410 align:middle line:84%
or a corporation, there
are so many moving parts.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.292 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:29:25.292 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And you know, some
people kind of maybe

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.060 align:middle line:90%
treat life like it's a movie.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And so, like, I'll have somebody
come to me and they'll say,

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:35.288 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm not--

00:29:35.288 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I want a reading but I don't
want to know about myself.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to know about
my granddaughters

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.558 align:middle line:84%
and their husband's
job and their children.

00:29:42.558 --> 00:29:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Are they going to school?

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
like, um, I think

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
you can do readings
like this, but I

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:90%
think they are disempowering.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.940 align:middle line:90%
They're weakening.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Explain that more.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well, what I
think about that person who

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.740 align:middle line:84%
asked me those questions
is, where are you at?

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: What are you into?

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.770 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.470 align:middle line:90%
What's going on with you?

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So I try to bring
it back to that.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you
encourage people to do readings

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.920 align:middle line:84%
and you encourage them to
have some kind of ritual,

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to be a
big deal but just kind of

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.800 align:middle line:84%
have a starting place where
you're setting your intention.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And that can be pretty much
anything, light a candle,

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.540 align:middle line:90%
say a little prayer?

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.473 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: One of
my things that I've

00:30:31.473 --> 00:30:33.460 align:middle line:84%
been thinking about
doing lately that I like

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:84%
is I get Orisha readings
from a candomblé priest that

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:38.950 align:middle line:90%
comes from South America.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.617 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I don't have any
idea what you're talking about.

00:30:41.617 --> 00:30:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Candomblé
is a variety of voodoo.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.248 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And so when
he does these readings,

00:30:46.248 --> 00:30:49.490 align:middle line:84%
he has these seed beads
in a very long piece.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.707 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And
he'll lay them out

00:30:51.707 --> 00:30:54.850 align:middle line:84%
on the table in a circle
like that, you know?

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he'll do
the reading in there.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:58.847 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
very nice thing.

00:30:58.847 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: The
beads feel protective

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and they feel like they're
holding the energy in kind

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of in concentrating it,
focusing it, that sort of thing.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And where do you
put voodoo in all of this?

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Because you mentioned in the
dream also about the voodoo

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.180 align:middle line:90%
master.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And where do you put
that in all of this

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:84%
in your own kind
of inner dialogue?

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.095 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people think of
voodoo as scary, but it's not.

00:31:27.095 --> 00:31:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Hollywood has--

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.262 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's done that.

00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not scary.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: No, it's not.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Voodoo is just like the tarot
and that these forces can

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:84%
be used for negative and they
can also be used for positive.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:43.295 align:middle line:84%
And so the candomblé priest that
I work with, he would tell you,

00:31:43.295 --> 00:31:46.040 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you use
these forces for negative,

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.160 align:middle line:90%
they'll come back on you.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: You don't
want to do that.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Know you're
playing with something

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:90%
that's very dangerous.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I remember
reading some deep lessons

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:84%
on what is called voodoo,
which in fact is simply

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.850 align:middle line:84%
operational principles of
affecting the material world

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:90%
through intention and mind.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I've met some
people recently too

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:10.470 align:middle line:84%
who are aligned with medicine
people in the Amazon jungle.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And that's
like voodoo too.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.935 align:middle line:90%
These are like nature religions.

00:32:15.935 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And they're
meant to help people.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: They can heal.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.000 align:middle line:90%
They cure.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.765 align:middle line:90%


00:32:25.765 --> 00:32:28.940 align:middle line:84%
The candomblé priest, when we're
driving in the car with him--

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.323 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: --we're
driving in the car

00:32:31.323 --> 00:32:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and he goes, oh, pretty
tree, pretty tree.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Look at the pretty tree.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Oh, cloud, beautiful
cloud, you know?

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And he says, as you put out this
joy for nature and appreciation

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.605 align:middle line:84%
of it, it's all--
it's like a mirror.

00:32:44.605 --> 00:32:45.910 align:middle line:90%
It reflects right back at you.

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:46.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Then that energy
is coming back at you.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:50.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's
always coming back

00:32:50.515 --> 00:32:52.640 align:middle line:84%
to your own mindset
and your own clarity,

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.747 align:middle line:84%
emotions, intentions
in the moment?

00:32:54.747 --> 00:32:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So on that
note, you have read--

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.042 align:middle line:84%
you wrote in the book that
if you're getting a reading

00:33:01.042 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:84%
or doing one for yourself or
getting a reading from someone

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.192 align:middle line:84%
else but it's based
on extreme anxiety

00:33:07.192 --> 00:33:08.900 align:middle line:84%
because life isn't
going the way you want

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.940 align:middle line:84%
or a need for a
quick validation,

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.360 align:middle line:84%
this is not a good mindset to
start a tarot reading from.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Right.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of people
are starting from there.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: You know, the
imagery that comes to mind

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.630 align:middle line:84%
is when you go
down into the ocean

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
look at something,

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.390 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to stir
up the silt at the bottom

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:27.860 align:middle line:84%
because then you
get this big cloud

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:90%
and you can't see anything.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to be
gentle as you progress into it.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.273 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:33:31.273 --> 00:33:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So explain
that a little bit more

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.652 align:middle line:84%
because you must
have a lot of people

00:33:34.652 --> 00:33:37.190 align:middle line:84%
that are coming to
you full of anxiety

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:90%
and with a need for validation.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you tell them to start?

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: You know, people
need attention and not

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.720 align:middle line:90%
generic attention.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.640 align:middle line:90%
They need quality attention.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So I try to give them
quality attention

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and ask them what they're
feeling anxiety about

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and then work with
that via the tarot.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, OK.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So they can come with
that but you have

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.690 align:middle line:90%
to address it up front really?

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I've noticed too is
when I'm talking to someone,

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.109 align:middle line:84%
sometimes my words feel, mm,
just kind of like they're there.

00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.909 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:14.409 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And then sometimes
I'll say something to someone

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:16.419 align:middle line:84%
and it's like all of a
sudden, they're in bold--

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:17.219 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.095 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: --and
they're lit up in light.

00:34:19.095 --> 00:34:19.895 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:34:19.895 --> 00:34:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And I'm thinking,
OK, now I'm on the right track.

00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:25.355 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Keep on
that one, you know?

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:27.798 align:middle line:90%
So I'll keep on that wavelength.

00:34:27.798 --> 00:34:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we're
going to the person.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.100 align:middle line:90%
This is how-to part.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.469 align:middle line:84%
So we have done
our little ritual.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:35.520 align:middle line:90%
We've let our candle.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.755 align:middle line:90%
We've set our intention.

00:34:36.755 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to start learning

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.339 align:middle line:90%
how to play with the deck.

00:34:39.339 --> 00:34:40.139 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we're going
to lay cards down however

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:45.680 align:middle line:84%
it says to in the
instruction manual, right?

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
how do we learn

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:84%
to engage our trusting,
our intuitive self?

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And how do we learn to
trust that intuition?

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you start as a
beginner with a deck like that?

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just numbers and you look
up the meaning in the book?

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.920 align:middle line:84%
For one thing is I think
it's very important that you

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.992 align:middle line:90%
write everything down.

00:35:09.992 --> 00:35:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Write your
questions down beforehand?

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Write your
question down and write down

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.410 align:middle line:90%
the cards you get.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Because then
you can go back and look--

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: --and see,
as the situation unfolds,

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.320 align:middle line:84%
how those cards
reflected that situation.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.615 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH:
Oftentimes, at first,

00:35:25.615 --> 00:35:28.100 align:middle line:84%
they will seem to have
no particular relation

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:28.900 align:middle line:90%
to the situation.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
what I've noticed.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: And then later--

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.645 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: --it'll
come clearer.

00:35:32.645 --> 00:35:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And a
beautiful thing to do

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:39.010 align:middle line:84%
is every day, pick either
one, say, or three cards,

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:42.620 align:middle line:84%
do a three-card or one-card
reading on the day.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Then at the end of the day, go
back and look and say, you know,

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.660 align:middle line:90%
how did my--

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.470 align:middle line:84%
how was my day reflected
in these cards?

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: That's a
marvelous way of learning.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.425 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm going to ask you
if you shuffle those a little

00:35:57.425 --> 00:35:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and you do a little three-card
reading for yourself

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and kind of clue us
into what it has to say.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: OK.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.942 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
you'd interpret it,

00:36:03.942 --> 00:36:06.290 align:middle line:84%
so we can see the simplest
way to engage, to begin with.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: OK.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.550 align:middle line:84%
You're forming a
question or an intention?

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well, I'm thinking
about how yesterday I did

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.970 align:middle line:90%
a three-card reading for today.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.495 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that happened
is it added up to 120.

00:36:21.495 --> 00:36:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that mean?

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.627 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: That's a
really powerful number.

00:36:24.627 --> 00:36:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And here we are.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And Baron
Samedi reminded me

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:32.457 align:middle line:84%
that 120 is the numbers 1
through 15 all added together.

00:36:32.457 --> 00:36:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDBACH: So 120 relates
to 15 in a very special way.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:10%
It's like the completion
or fulfillment of 15.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and
that was today.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah,
that was today.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
probably toward the center

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:47.640 align:middle line:90%
of your activities today.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Powerful.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:51.980 align:middle line:90%
So let's see what you get now.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle line:10%
>>SANDBACH: OK, what question
do you think I should ask?

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.370 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I could say, what's the
rest of my day going to be like

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:10%
or I could say--

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I would say
what's 2024 for me?

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: OK.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, for you.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: For me?

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: 2024 for me.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.220 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: OK.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:13.510 align:middle line:90%
A little scary to do because--

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:14.343 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:37:14.343 --> 00:37:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: --this
is for a whole year.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
for a whole year,

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.310 align:middle line:90%
just to see if there's a theme--

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: I'm making a joke.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.515 align:middle line:90%
It's not scary at all.

00:37:19.515 --> 00:37:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --a
theme that pops up.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.520 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Well, the
card is-- the first card

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.390 align:middle line:84%
in the middle is judgment,
which is Arcanum 20.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: The first
card is the four of cups.

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
does that mean?

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: The four of
cups is the Jupiter of cups.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, Jupiter
is very expansive.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: It's reaching out.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: OK.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And the last card is
the four of wands.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we really
notice here, there's two fours.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a very Jupiterian year.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Now it's very easy to see the
positive meaning of Jupiter

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's
abundance, it's wealth.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.480 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone
loves Jupiter.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:07.632 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yeah, growth.

00:38:07.632 --> 00:38:11.030 align:middle line:84%
The negative side of
Jupiter is too much.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excess.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:12.425 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:38:12.425 --> 00:38:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: So I think I'm
going to have to make a lot

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.160 align:middle line:84%
of decisions as to
what to leave out--

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.418 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: --and
what to focus on.

00:38:19.418 --> 00:38:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And then
this card in the middle,

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Judgment is ruled by the moon.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the moon is about
living moment to moment,

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.100 align:middle line:84%
living day to day, and
going with the flow.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is almost
telling me, don't make

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.580 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of long range plans.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.578 align:middle line:84%
Just go with what-- as it
comes with what comes up.

00:38:41.578 --> 00:38:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could it also
be with the word judgment

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.480 align:middle line:90%
"don't attach to story"?

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Sure.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we're going
to be hit with a lot of drama

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:51.840 align:middle line:90%
in the few years ahead of us?

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Drama is going to
be center stage?

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes, exactly.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this would be
saying, go with the flow,

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.840 align:middle line:84%
don't attach, don't go--
and maybe even don't

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.830 align:middle line:84%
go into judgment about
everything playing out

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:03.630 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And what you
just said too kind of

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.992 align:middle line:84%
goes along with the two
Jupiters on either side

00:39:06.992 --> 00:39:09.450 align:middle line:84%
because there are going to be
a lot of stuff in this coming

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:09.950 align:middle line:90%
year.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I just got
the same message,

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:84%
not through tarot
cards, but very directly

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.810 align:middle line:84%
about the subject of judgment
when I did a meditation

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and chatted with
my beings recently.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:21.870 align:middle line:90%
It was about judgment.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was really
quite beautiful about what

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.100 align:middle line:84%
happens if we can be
there, be part of it,

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.950 align:middle line:84%
be witness, let it,
like you say, flow

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.740 align:middle line:84%
through us without
creating resistance

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.900 align:middle line:84%
if it's not our
preference because that

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.813 align:middle line:84%
wastes a lot of spiritual
energy to go into resistance.

00:39:37.813 --> 00:39:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And since
you're a being of light,

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:84%
when it flows through you, it
gets filtered and processed

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and it comes out the other
side cleaner and clearer.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's good.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.800 align:middle line:84%
That's really you're reading
kind of for all of us.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Exactly.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
wasn't just your reading.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: No, that's--

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: This is
definitely what it feels like.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.165 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Let me see if
I can do this in my head,

00:39:59.165 --> 00:40:03.020 align:middle line:90%
but the four of cups is 54.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the number.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Then 20 for the middle card.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:12.090 align:middle line:90%
And then the 4 of wands is 68.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:18.263 align:middle line:90%
So what's 68 plus 54 and 20?

00:40:18.263 --> 00:40:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so I'm
just doing a quick little

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:84%
add because we're
under pressure here.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.723 align:middle line:84%
Normally, I can do it
in my head in seconds.

00:40:23.723 --> 00:40:25.940 align:middle line:90%
So here we're got 142.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: 142.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:27.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Roughly.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And so
that adds up to--

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 142 for the
whole lot of them.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And 1 and
4 and 2 add up to 7.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:37.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
change and transformation,

00:40:37.763 --> 00:40:38.805 align:middle line:90%
spiritual transformation.

00:40:38.805 --> 00:40:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: And it's
transcending too.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: It's rising above.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think that's
our tarot message for the year.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Transformation,
rising above,

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:84%
don't hold fast to
judgments, and be

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.490 align:middle line:84%
ready to decide what
has to be discarded

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and what's worth remaining.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Excellent, we just got
a global tarot reading from you.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.110 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, any final thoughts?

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.862 align:middle line:90%
Because there's so much.

00:41:03.862 --> 00:41:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And people just have to
get them in their hands

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:90%
and play with them.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.670 align:middle line:84%
One more question, does
it matter whether it's

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.080 align:middle line:90%
right side up or upside down?

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: You know,
I don't go with that.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:13.073 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a
lot of people don't.

00:41:13.073 --> 00:41:14.400 align:middle line:90%
So let's just-- let's say no.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.270 align:middle line:90%
It's just the card.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: I like that.

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the answer to that.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we sign off here?

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: One idea I really
love is when you draw a card

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and you just think,
what does that mean?

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how that relates.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: I'm drawing a
blank on that one, that's

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:36.050 align:middle line:84%
so powerful because you're at
the edge of your understanding.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you focus on that
card and really you, say,

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:42.490 align:middle line:84%
read about it, meditate
on it, think about it,

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:46.480 align:middle line:84%
you can grow in your knowledge
and understanding of that card

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates
to your situation.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And this will greatly advance
your knowledge of the tarot

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:57.010 align:middle line:84%
because you're working with the
parts you don't yet comprehend.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:00.167 align:middle line:84%
This has been a
really fun journey

00:42:00.167 --> 00:42:02.920 align:middle line:84%
through the history of tarot
and how we can personally

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.720 align:middle line:90%
start engaging with it.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.710 align:middle line:84%
For people like me
who are intimidated,

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't want one of those decks
with devils and people dead.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.570 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather have the one--

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: It doesn't suit you.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd rather have
the acupuncture version.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.645 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:42:13.645 --> 00:42:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Yes.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, thank you so
much for the work you've done

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful
illustrations in your book.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDBACH: Thank you for
a wonderful interview.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.217 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed spending
time here with you.

00:42:22.217 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:23.950 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.150 align:middle line:10%
Well, the name of John's
book is "Soul Journey

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:10%
Through The Tarot."

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.910 align:middle line:84%
You can find it
anywhere books are sold.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:31.570 align:middle line:84%
You can also take a deeper
examination of John's cards

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.750 align:middle line:84%
by going to
johnsandbach.net where

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.600 align:middle line:84%
you can also schedule a personal
tarot reading if you wish.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't if you have the time,
but if you have some time--

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SANDBACH: Oh, yes, I do.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:40.810 align:middle line:90%
I most certainly do.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:41.610 align:middle line:90%
