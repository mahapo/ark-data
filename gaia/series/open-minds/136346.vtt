00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: OK now
we're getting into some almost

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.799 align:middle line:90%
sacrilegious territory, OK?

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:90%
.>>BARBARA HAND CLOW: Oh, good.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.631 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think it's necessary.

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:36.560 align:middle line:10%
As I mentioned in
our other show,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:10%
the reason we're doing this
and have reconvened here

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:10%
in British Columbia
is that when we

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:10%
did the Alchemy of Nine
conventions, we almost--

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.040 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why-- skipped
past the fourth dimension.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:10%
Because it has such immediate
and direct influence

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:10%
on this dimension, it seems
like that was a huge oversight.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.649 align:middle line:10%
I thought, what happened?

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.440 align:middle line:10%
So now we're back, and
now we have a chance

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:10%
to really go into it.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to devote the
hour to the fourth dimension

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:10%
and also the beings associated
with its influence and control

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:10%
in terms of humanity,
which are the Annunaki.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:10%
And so what I would like
to do is have you first

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.090 align:middle line:10%
give us the standard
understanding

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.420 align:middle line:10%
of who the Annunaki
are, Sitchin-style.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to go on, and I'm

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
going to you get your
impressions beyond Sitchin

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:90%
in some very direct questions.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
set up the Annunaki.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.720 align:middle line:10%
.>>HAND CLOW: Well, the Annunaki
are also called the Anunnaj,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:10%
are the gods who
vary in literature,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.670 align:middle line:10%
and then they pass into Akkadian
and Babylonian literature.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:10%
And we've known about these
gods since the Sumerian tablets

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:10%
were translated 200 years ago.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And mostly Sumerian scholars
have investigated this issue.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's is very similar to the
pantheon in Egyptian teaching,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:84%
or in any religious teaching,
any ancient religious teaching.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And then Zecharia Sitchin
came along in 1976

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and published The
12th Planet, which

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.020 align:middle line:84%
is his interpretation of who
the Annunaki are in the Sumerian

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:90%
scriptures.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's
partially right,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think
he's totally right.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Set us up with how
he described who they were,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:84%
what their role is,
why they were here.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.645 align:middle line:84%
.>>HAND CLOW: He says
that there were a bunch

00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials, and
he says that they come from

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.010 align:middle line:84%
a planet called Nibiru, which
means in Sumerian "the planet

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.510 align:middle line:90%
of the crossing."

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:90%
And Nibiru means the crossing.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And so he says that this
planet goes around the Sun,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's part of
our solar system,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and it passes close to
Earth every 3,600 years.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And he says that when
it passes close to Earth

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
that the Annunaki then
land, and he believes--

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
he's not with us
anymore-- but he believes

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:90%
that they had spaceships.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:84%
He believes that
their literature

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:90%
discusses spaceships.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
think so, personally.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But he believes the
Sumerian literature

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
is describing the
gods coming down

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:90%
from Nibiru and from the sky.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And then once they
get down to the earth,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
then take over human
culture and impregnate

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
the best-looking women
and produce a race.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:90%
So that Sitchin's basic story.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And I mean from
that, a lot of other people

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:10%
have picked up on
that basic story,

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:10%
and what comes out of it
is the notion that we're

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.185 align:middle line:10%
a slave species to the gods.

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:10%
.>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
.>>HAND CLOW:
Yeah, that's right.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.093 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell us where the
enslavement part of that story

00:03:35.093 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
.>>HAND CLOW: Well, he believes
that they have been coming

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth for the
last 400,000 years.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And first of all,
I see no evidence

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
for that in
archeology whatsoever,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
but there are people
who disagree with that.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:84%
We first start seeing real
evidence of human mining

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
activity and all that,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:84%
around 100,000
years ago with red

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:90%
ochre mining in southern Africa.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So he believed
that they have been

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.160 align:middle line:84%
enslaving the human race for
400 years, and then gradually--

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 400,000.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:90%
.>>HAND CLOW: Oh, excuse me--

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:90%
400,000 years.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're gradually
triggering humans into evolving.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And it just doesn't fit
with my own paradigm

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.030 align:middle line:84%
at all with what has
happened with the human race.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:10%
Let's go into that story
a little bit further,

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.417 align:middle line:10%
and then I want to get to the

00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:10%
Pleiadians and speak about this.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:10%
There's something
in there that's

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:10%
a nuance that I've
always wondered about.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:10%
So the primary characters
were Enlil and Enki, right?

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And what
were their positions?

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.605 align:middle line:10%
Because they really were
in opposing positions.

00:04:37.605 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, they're
kind of like in the literature

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of like a
Cain and Abel figure.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And Enki is the
good guy, and Enlil

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:90%
is the bad guy, the bad god.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And, to tell you the
truth, I can't really

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:90%
say too much more about it.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:90%
I haven't really studied that.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But do you think
that maybe the Christian lore

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:10%
of Cain and Abel was
directly handed down

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.011 align:middle line:10%
through that particular story?

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, yeah.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
What happened with the
Sumerian literature,

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
we know for sure, is that,
as far as Western religion

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
is concerned, the stories that
are in the Sumerian literature,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and then the Acadian
literature, and then

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:90%
the Babylonian literature--

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.227 align:middle line:84%
we know that those
influenced the Bible.

00:05:21.227 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the
stories in the Bible go

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:90%
back to the early literature.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So you could say
Cain and Abel could

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:90%
be a model of Enlil and Enki.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: You
could say that, yeah.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:10%
And now what about the Nibiru--

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:10%
the whole notion, this planet.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.895 align:middle line:10%
Meaning there are chat
rooms around the world that

00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:38.695 align:middle line:10%
are hysterical--

00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Oh, yes.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:10%
Millions.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --about
our annihilation

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.740 align:middle line:10%
by the planet Nibiru.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about it
from your perspective.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll do that from
two perspectives.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there are
many, many points of view

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
we can take regarding
what's actually going on

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
with the solar system and
whether this planet exists

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
There's also a lot of people
who believe that we're actually

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:90%
a binary star system.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
that's what I think.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.675 align:middle line:84%
The major person on that score
is a guy named Cruttenden--

00:06:10.675 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Walter
Cruttenden, yes.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --a scientist
named Walter Cruttenden.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And so there is an
issue with something

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
influencing the sun and
something influencing

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:90%
the solar system.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But, having studied
both ideas, I

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
find that the issue of the
binary star system a lot more--

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.353 align:middle line:84%
see, Regina, I go
more toward science.

00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so with
the binary star system--

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:84%
since we now know
that at least 95%

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:84%
of the suns out in the
universe are binary,

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.360 align:middle line:84%
there's every reason to
think that our sun is binary.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And Cruttenden
says, in his belief,

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.711 align:middle line:10%
that that companion
star is Sirius.

00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.293 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Does that
make sense to you?

00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, certainly, with
the emphasis on Sirius

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:10%
in the times the Egyptians.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.595 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But then
there's an issue.

00:06:56.595 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
that we can't see it.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think even
Cruttenden gets into issues

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.475 align:middle line:90%
of how we can't see it.

00:07:01.475 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Because when
something is going--

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Brown dwarf.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.088 align:middle line:84%
When something is
going around like

00:07:05.088 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
that it's hard to detect
it and hard to see it.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say I
would tend to think

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
that we're just not seeing it
because it's a brown dwarf.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I tend to go in that direction.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really
know, and, again,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
this is one of these--
we're in a period

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:90%
of marvelous time of discovery.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, and
there are dynamics

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:10%
that are in play all the time
regarding essentially keeping

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.797 align:middle line:10%
the cosmos in its place.

00:07:31.797 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And there are forces
of repulsion and attraction

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:10%
that are always in
place, that keep

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:10%
these systems stable and safe.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:10%
Yet we buy so terribly
into this notion

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:10%
that something's going to
come and slam into us again,

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:10%
create another cataclysm,
and it's that planet.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.659 align:middle line:84%
And so his work has instilled
a great deal of fear in people.

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, see,
I think that you're

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.720 align:middle line:84%
getting closer to why people
have bought into this Sitchin

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:90%
idea to this degree.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Because what I look for when
I watch an idea like this,

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and playing out, and
seeing how people respond,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
is when I see a
tremendous amount of fear

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.880 align:middle line:90%
and a tremendous amount of--

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:84%
what's the right word for
it-- apocalyptical thoughts,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:90%
I get pretty suspicious.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Because people just tend to buy
into apocalyptical thoughts.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that this
cataclysm that we actually

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.750 align:middle line:84%
did experience-- scientifically
we know about all

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:84%
of these cataclysms, from
11,500 to 13,000 years ago.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:90%
We have all the data on it now.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we're seeing
with people is a tendency

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.619 align:middle line:84%
to buy into an apocalypse now
because it happened before.

00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And then one of
the interesting things to me

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:84%
about my lifetime is that my
grandfather was half Cherokee.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And he was my teacher.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me all
about the cataclysm

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and all about the
stuff that I've

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:84%
come through with in
this lifetime in my work.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And what was strange for
me as a child was there

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.180 align:middle line:90%
was my grandfather's story.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And he was a Cherokee
record keeper,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and so he knew what
he was talking about.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, meanwhile,
science completely

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:84%
contradicted his story until
Velikovsky started publishing

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.250 align:middle line:90%
books in the 1960s and 1970s.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a
mystery to me when

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I was going through
my levels of education

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.367 align:middle line:84%
as to why people didn't
get the real story.

00:09:24.367 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Because, to me, it
was kind of obvious

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:90%
what the real story was.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, I was
told the real story.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, I have
come to the conclusion

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:84%
that part of the
post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to just block
the memory because the memory is

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:90%
so terrifying of what happened.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:90%
Because it was really bad.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, very little
survived on this planet.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a miracle that our
species is even here.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And virtually
every major religion

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.520 align:middle line:90%
reflects this story.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.603 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:09:51.603 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And so then what
happens is that people,

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:84%
because they've been denied
the story by science--

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I watched scientists
through the 70s and 80s.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.999 align:middle line:84%
They tried to shut
Velikovsky down.

00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:84%
They tried to get his publisher
to stop publishing him.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:84%
He was really--
like a lot of people

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
who have really correct
ideas-- was really

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
harassed by the
scientific establishment.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally
decided the scientists

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:84%
have a great big case of
primary catastrophobia.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.915 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: In
other words, they

00:10:19.915 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:84%
are so terrified that
anything like this

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
could have happened that
they continually deny it.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately
we're now in a time

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:84%
where everybody
knows this happened.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
First of all, in alternative
research and big alternative

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:90%
researchers work with concept--

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Graham Hancock and--

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Hancock and--

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --Robert
Schoch, all of them.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we've come to a point now
where people know about this.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the scientific
establishment, meanwhile,

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:90%
is digging up all the data.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So a new
paradigm is in place,

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to straighten
out a lot of confused thinking.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And a lot
of this confusion

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:10%
actually came at the hands
of Sitchin originally.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:10%
And so many devotees
of his work have really

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:10%
gone on to expand on his story.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:10%
That if it was distorted
thinking to begin with,

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:10%
what we're getting is something
more distorted essentially.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:10%
And you knew him when.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I would like to-- if you don't
really talk about this much--

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
but I would like you
to share a little bit

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.491 align:middle line:84%
about your early meeting with
him and relationship with him.

00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, I
don't care very much,

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.050 align:middle line:84%
because my primary
career in this lifetime

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:90%
has been as a publisher.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
so I rarely talk

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:84%
about people that I've
published and authors that I've

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.311 align:middle line:90%
worked with and all that.

00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And because we, our
company, was one

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
of the publishers of Sitchin's
work, the hardcover editions,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm really not at liberty
to say a lot of things.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.817 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a
professional issue.

00:11:37.817 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:90%
But of course I got to know him.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.858 align:middle line:84%
Because I get to know
all of our authors.

00:11:40.858 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And I had some very interesting
conversations with him.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot
of respect for him.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And you know William Irwin
Thompson, the philosopher?

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Remember
William Irwin Thompson?

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, William Irwin Thompson,
I think he's probably dead now.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Because he was 10 or 15
years older than I am.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But William Irwin
Thompson and I got

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:84%
into a six-hour conversation
about this about 20 years ago.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And William finally said,
"You know what, Barbara?

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.030 align:middle line:84%
This is a case of
misplaced concreteness."

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.200 align:middle line:90%
And I really--

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
what that mean to us.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I really like that idea,
because what he was saying--

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:90%
and it's true--

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of what Sitchin
had to say was true.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But then he had to
go too far with it.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Because you don't have to--

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:84%
it's just like the whole
issue of extraterrestrials

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:84%
abducting people and
some of the issues

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:84%
that we saw happening 20
years ago so frequently.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:84%
In my experience, people
turn psychic things

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:90%
into solid things.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.540 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't have to--

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
the Annunaki do not have
to be solid beings that

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:84%
landed with spaceships
on this planet,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
but they still could exist
as beings in the universe.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And that's
what we'll talk about

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.786 align:middle line:10%
as reaching in
from another realm,

00:12:51.786 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:10%
from another dimensional field.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.225 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But,
still, it ended up

00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:57.750 align:middle line:10%
that there seemed to be an
agenda that was playing out

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.790 align:middle line:10%
in Sitchin's work.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Oh, yeah.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.873 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
explain what that agenda

00:13:00.873 --> 00:13:02.252 align:middle line:90%
was from your point of view.

00:13:02.252 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: It's worth really
getting to the agenda of it.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I'd just like to say, before
that, that my part in it

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.600 align:middle line:84%
is that in the "Alchemy
of Nine Dimensions,"

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians, not
me, but the Pleiadians

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.030 align:middle line:84%
came through and said that
every dimension has a keeper.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
there's nine dimensions.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.023 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So,
like, there's Sirius,

00:13:20.023 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
keeps the sixth dimension, the
Pleiades, the fifth dimension.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So what they seem
to be saying is

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
that, in each one
of these dimensions,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:84%
there are intelligences,
but they aren't necessarily

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:90%
solid human beings like we are.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:84%
We're the keepers of
the third dimension,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and so we're solid human
beings sitting here right now.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so
what they said was,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:84%
they said the Annunaki
are the keepers

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:90%
of the fourth dimension.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.064 align:middle line:84%
And I've spent the last
25 years working on that

00:13:46.064 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:90%
and trying to understand it.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that I do
understand it now,

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that
they are the holders

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
of a gigantic psychological
archetypal realm.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And, in
that sense, we humans

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
seem to need to have an
archetypal field to play in

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:90%
between dark and light.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Like I think when that kind
of experience is healthy

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:84%
it shows up in art,
in various forms

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
of art, and mystery play,
and dancing, and music,

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
that field becomes

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.910 align:middle line:84%
unhealthy it goes into politics,
and bad guys and good guys,

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So the Annunaki, these gods
or beings of this dimension,

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:84%
are the keepers and holders
of all of that information

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.960 align:middle line:90%
and all of that data.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
is it in the direction--

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and he was supposedly directly
translated from cuneiform,

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:90%
This knowledge--

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.496 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What was
it in there, embedded

00:14:40.496 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:10%
in there, that made him believe
these were physical beings?

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: As far as I'm
concerned, it's his own belief.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Now there's another issue
with Zecharia Sitchin's

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:90%
translations.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
He, when he published his
books, a lot of Sumerian experts

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:90%
were really freaked out.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Because they've
studied the literature,

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and so have I. The
[INAUDIBLE] is one

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:90%
of my favorite spiritual works.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And they freaked out
because they just

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:90%
didn't see it the same way.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So, finally, one
Sumerian scholar--

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:90%
a big time Sumerian scholar--

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:84%
went after Sitchin's
translations.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And, just like with
all translations,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:90%
they have a real slant to them.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the slant is to
go into this description

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
of these gods who landed in
spaceships and stuff like that.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in the minds
of the other scholars

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.537 align:middle line:84%
these were not
physical entities?

00:15:32.537 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes, exactly.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Before Sitchin came along,
they just think of them just

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:90%
like the Egyptian pantheon.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: People don't
think of Anubis and Ra

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:84%
as physical beings who
came down and landed.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.948 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Although there
are issues with that one,

00:15:44.948 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
too, because some
people do think that.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And some people think that
around 6,000 years ago

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
or something of that being of
Sirius, the Egyptian pantheon,

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:90%
actually landed on the Earth.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a sticky wicket,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you
have to wonder, like,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
are we talking about beings who
become solid here but otherwise

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:90%
aren't solid where they exist?

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: That's my
experience with the Pleiades.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's what
I was going to ask you next.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: The only place
I have any direct experience

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:90%
is with the Pleiadians.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And I
basically am almost

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.750 align:middle line:84%
like a hybrid person,
and Earth human being

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and a person who
lives on the Pleiades.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm existing
in the Pleiades, which

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:84%
is often meditation and very
high states of consciousness,

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm not particularly physical.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm almost more like an
electromagnetic light form.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:90%
And then I've seen them twice.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I saw them when I
was four months old,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:90%
and I still remember it.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw them
when I was around 40.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So the most
significant appearances

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.317 align:middle line:84%
when I was an adult, and I
had four children, and the two

00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:84%
younger ones were, like,
three and five years old.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So, when you're home
with small children,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:84%
you can't take your
eyes off of them.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So, in this case, I had a
house, and I had a kitchen,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and I had a study behind.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiadians-- I was
in my study for some reason.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:90%
I got a few minutes or whatever.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe Jerry was outside.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:04.579 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But they appeared in my study,
and it was a group of them,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:84%
like around 13 or 14 of them,
who just parked themselves

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.250 align:middle line:90%
on a banco--

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that's the way they call
a bed in New Mexico.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
They stayed there
for four hours.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I went back into the
house, checked everything,

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and came back and forth
four or five times.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:90%
And they were just there.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were radiating the most
exquisite, beautiful energy,

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
just energy of just
absolute unconditional love.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
they look like to you?

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Like I
say, these little--

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:90%
like Casper the ghost.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Like I had 13 or
14 little Casper

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.400 align:middle line:90%
the ghosts in the banco bed.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.435 align:middle line:90%
And they were almost palpable.

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's interesting.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.268 align:middle line:10%
Because once you start
getting into this,

00:17:44.268 --> 00:17:47.090 align:middle line:10%
then you start looking at
the stories of other people.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:10%
Steven Greer, for
one, which is he

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:10%
closely aligns himself
with the Pleiades, as well,

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:10%
and those beings.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:10%
And, for him, when
you see his drawings,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:10%
they're very humanoid in nature.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.923 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Mm-hm, mm-hm.

00:17:57.923 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Now--
and I even remember

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:10%
him saying to a group of
people who were saying, well,

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.628 align:middle line:10%
what did they look like--
and he pointed to me.

00:18:03.628 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:10%
He said, they look like her.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:10%
So now where would
he get an impression

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.895 align:middle line:10%
that Pleiadians look more
or less like me or us?

00:18:09.895 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, this is
an interesting question.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a whole
bunch of Pleiadians.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.876 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember, there's
seven stars in the system?

00:18:15.876 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And, as far as I
can tell, in different stars,

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:84%
in different planets, they
have different appearances,

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:90%
as far as I can tell.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.360 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So the
ones I'm relating

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
to are these little
electromagnetic beings.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But I agree
with what he says about you.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I've also seen
a blond type Pleiadian.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: I've seen the type.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:10%
And another thing that I found
kind of curious about this

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:10%
is the Pleiades can be
seen with the naked eye.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.300 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Mm-hm.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So we're looking
at something that's roughly--

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --in our
range of frequency--

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Sure.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --which would
be still, more or less,

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:10%
considered third dimensional.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:10%
So if the planets
exist physically

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:10%
in the third dimension,
are we seeing

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:10%
beings that are
another expression

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.060 align:middle line:10%
or living within another
dimension of those planets,

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.226 align:middle line:10%
just as Earth is
multi-dimensional and we are?

00:18:59.226 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, as
you know, in my system,

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiades is
fifth dimensional.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And then the
Earth thing is third--

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.095 align:middle line:90%
we were third dimensional--

00:19:06.095 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm asking.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --in
space and time.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So, as far as I can
tell, they exist

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:90%
in a fifth dimensional realm.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But in
the general region

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.944 align:middle line:10%
of those third
dimensional planets,

00:19:14.944 --> 00:19:16.610 align:middle line:10%
or would appear to
be third dimensional.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: They may not be.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And like, for example,
take the Sirians.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And some people think
that they see beings

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:23.815 align:middle line:90%
that look like the Sirians.

00:19:23.815 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;>REGINA: Right.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.785 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But,
boy, what I see

00:19:25.785 --> 00:19:27.949 align:middle line:84%
is just outrageous
complex geometry.

00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:28.865 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:28.865 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.859 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So what
are we seeing when

00:19:30.859 --> 00:19:33.320 align:middle line:10%
we see the light from those
stars at night in the sky?

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: We're seeing
the same thing we're seeing

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:90%
with any kind of starlight.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.906 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But I do think that
the planets and star systems

00:19:39.906 --> 00:19:41.405 align:middle line:84%
that are keepers
of the dimensions--

00:19:41.405 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I think we
have very profound reactions

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I think people have
strong reaction to Sirius

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:90%
and certainly the Pleiades.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.940 align:middle line:90%
People talk about that.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And then also the
Orion star system,

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:84%
which is the keeper of
the eighth dimension.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.620 align:middle line:84%
That star system has
had a huge impact

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:84%
on humanity and sacred
geometry on this planet.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Because all over
the planet we have

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.510 align:middle line:84%
renditions of the
Orion star system,

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet
at sacred sites.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.266 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So people,
for some reason,

00:20:10.266 --> 00:20:13.460 align:middle line:84%
are mirroring the eighth
dimension down here.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.100 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:10%
So now let's go back
to the Annunaki.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.870 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for clarifying
that within the Pleiadians.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Listen--

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I would like to
say one more thing, Regina.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, please.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Just to clarify
it as much as you can.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: John Mack did a
lot of really wonderful work--

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, he did.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: --at Harvard.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Showing that what people see
is directly relational to where

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.590 align:middle line:90%
their consciousness is at.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's say a being appears
in my space or your space

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:84%
from the eighth
dimension, which is

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:84%
the realm of divine
consciousness.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:84%
You could call God,
goddess, if you want to.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:90%
One person might see Jesus.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Another person might
see Mary Magdalene.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Another person might see
an electromagnetic form.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Another person might see a bird.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's like--
what people see--

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at something that
is not physical in the way we

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:90%
are in this dimension.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a different thing.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so people
perceive it differently.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: You know.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is very true.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:10%
And John Mack's work
was stunning in that.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:10%
And what did you take away
from John Mack's work,

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:10%
in that essentially he
said this phenomena-- there

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:10%
are commonalities to this
abduction phenomena, right?

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Mm-hm.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: He had-- what--
thousands of clinical cases

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:10%
in the end.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And he put his own reputation
on the line for it and said,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.810 align:middle line:84%
whatever's going on, there
are consistent themes that

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.035 align:middle line:90%
are happening in these cases.

00:21:28.035 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you think was--

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:90%
what do you attribute that to?

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, see,
if you look at things

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:84%
from the point of view
of the archetypal mind,

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.675 align:middle line:84%
archetypal consciousness,
and it seems

00:21:37.675 --> 00:21:39.050 align:middle line:84%
to have been a
phase, by the way.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:10%
You notice how you don't
hear about it anymore?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:40.850 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: It seems to have
just been a period of time.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: And
it could be that we

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:10%
were getting to the point in
the 1940s and 1950s or whatever.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.420 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's
look at the fact

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:84%
that science was
exploring space.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And so, once science
started going out into space

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and exploring it,
then people naturally

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
started thinking about, well,
how am I connected to that?

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of encounter
am I going to have?

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And so then, if
a person is going

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.610 align:middle line:84%
through some kind of a
traumatic experience,

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.600 align:middle line:84%
like some kind of
nightmarish experience,

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:84%
they may see it as
extraterrestrial.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at
people historically,

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:84%
they've seen these
things as gnomes,

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:90%
as angels, as extraterrestrials.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.262 align:middle line:84%
So where is that
coming-- the question

00:22:23.262 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:90%
is where is that coming from?

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, if
you really understand

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:84%
my nine-dimensional model,
my nine-dimensional model

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
is saying that in
this dimension,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension, impulses
are coming through to us

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:90%
from higher realms.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is they filter

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.638 align:middle line:90%
through the fourth dimension.

00:22:41.638 --> 00:22:44.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the
system basically works.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's just
assume this is true.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And let's assume that
for some reason, which

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
completely understand,

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.270 align:middle line:84%
let's say that
impulses are coming

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:90%
at us from higher dimensions.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to think
about that, because I'm

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:84%
sure you've had a few, what
I call, numinous experiences.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Where you just have an
experience of something

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:84%
that is so otherworldly
that it just--

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --it just-- you
know, you just are stunned.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so
then, OK, there you are.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:11.768 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're a
four-year-old child.

00:23:11.768 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're a
teenager or whatever.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:90%
What do you do with that?

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, the human mind naturally
goes through its own program

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:25.627 align:middle line:84%
to seek a way to explain what
that is, to see what that is.

00:23:25.627 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of-- other
people have said there's

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:90%
nothing unusual about that.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But I'll say something
that most people

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.480 align:middle line:90%
haven't been willing to say.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.774 align:middle line:84%
When I was grappling
with this issue of,

00:23:34.774 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
like, why are all these people
getting abducted and hauled

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:90%
away in cars and all that.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:90%
You remember that.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: It was what?

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.790 align:middle line:90%
The '80s and '90s mostly.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So course,
like with anything,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I went into a deep level
of questioning about this.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Like, what could possibly this
be, the abductions, especially.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized,
you know what?

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:55.190 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in these stories
by these extraterrestrials

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
abducting humans that isn't
going on in medical technology

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.384 align:middle line:90%
day after day after day.

00:24:01.384 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.008 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And then
suddenly I realized

00:24:04.008 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that these bizarre stories
of people being abducted

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and all these
things done to them

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:84%
corresponded exactly
with the point

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
when people started
buying into and paying

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
their money for invasive
medical technology.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot of it has
been a way of processing

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:22.520 align:middle line:90%
modern medicine.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I think modern medicine
is an extremely traumatic

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.600 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.200 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:10%
You probably would
not have a direct line

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:10%
up with the individuals that
Sitchin was dealing with,

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.197 align:middle line:10%
all of them having had
invasive medical procedures.

00:24:36.197 --> 00:24:38.280 align:middle line:10%
Are you saying it was more
in the cumulative mind?

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: No, I'm
saying it's a way--

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.220 align:middle line:90%
just think, OK.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Go back 30, 40 years
ago, 50 years ago,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:84%
whatever, when really
invasive type tech--

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and when I say invasive
type technology,

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:51.517 align:middle line:84%
people are supposed to go
off and get tested regularly

00:24:51.517 --> 00:24:53.600 align:middle line:84%
to see if there's anything
wrong with them or not.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:54.865 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Instead
of just living--

00:24:54.865 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.335 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --and
knowing they're OK--

00:24:56.335 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:58.735 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --until it's
time to go to the doctor.

00:24:58.735 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So really people got
under the microscope

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:90%
around 40 or 50 years ago.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And my father was a doctor and
a very big doctor in the AMA.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was American
Medical Association.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And he was very, very
upset by what was going on.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Because suddenly
we turned the human

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.790 align:middle line:84%
into something that had
to be examined, prodded--

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, like colonoscopies--

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And profited from.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: --things like that.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Like, well, that's what
the Zeta Reticuli do,

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:90%
if you know what I mean.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying to say is--
back to the fourth dimension,

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
which is our topic
today, which is

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:84%
the archetypal realm
of consciousness,

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and the part of our
awareness that splits energy

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.380 align:middle line:90%
into dark and light.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
As this invasive
medical technology

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.520 align:middle line:84%
started to come
into people's lives,

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and then they're gored
into paying for it

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and suffering for
it, et cetera--

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that the invasive
extraterrestrial issue

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.080 align:middle line:84%
might have actually been a way
for people to process that--

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Process that.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: --medicine.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Because
now it's all gone.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Where did that go?

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And then
a whole bunch of people

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:84%
just don't go to the doctor
anymore, you know, now.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.081 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, it seems when
it comes to the ET story,

00:26:02.081 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:10%
you have waves of types
of characters and stories

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:06.540 align:middle line:10%
that emerge decade by decade.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.539 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:10.190 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And that era was the
era of abduction, for example.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And now we're kind of moving
almost to transhumanism.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.610 align:middle line:90%
Particularly a little alien DNA.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.568 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So if you
take scientific-- if you

00:26:18.568 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
take space technology
and combine it

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:84%
with medical technology, they
do correspond in the same time.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.884 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:26:27.884 --> 00:26:30.216 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And when something
happens in our reality--

00:26:30.216 --> 00:26:31.780 align:middle line:84%
this is a really
important point.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:84%
When some kind of big
change, an unusual thing

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:84%
occurs in our reality,
everybody processes it.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't just happen in
the hospital down the street.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.334 align:middle line:84%
We all process what's
coming into our reality.

00:26:45.334 --> 00:26:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Like, right now,
I think we're all

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
trying to process what's
going on with computer devices

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on
with some of the--

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.610 align:middle line:84%
well, for example,
how about robots.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to process robots?

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:84%
But I think we need to start
realizing, in that reality--

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:05.290 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension-- we
are all very, very, very

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.570 align:middle line:84%
heavily impacted by the
fourth dimension every day.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've used the analogy that
we're like an Oreo cookie.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.611 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
the second dimension

00:27:13.611 --> 00:27:17.740 align:middle line:84%
is the bottom of the
cookie with the dark cake

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it's made out of.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:22.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the realm under us where
the earthquakes come from.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're just sticky gooey
sugar in the third dimension.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth dimension
is the top of the Oreo cookie.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, lo and behold, I found
out from another researcher,

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Scott Wolter, last week
when I was reading a book,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:90%
that the Oreo cookie is--

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:90%
and I showed it to.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You did.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And you brought a package along.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: When Regina
arrived this time,

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:90%
I gave her an Oreo cookie.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the Oreo cookies
are all imprinted with all

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.482 align:middle line:90%
of the main Templar's symbols.

00:27:46.482 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked when
you pointed that out.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And when you think
of trillions and trillions

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:90%
of people--

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I was looking at it.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.220 align:middle line:84%
The Maltese cross--
you have fleur-de-lis--

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.021 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:27:54.021 --> 00:27:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: It's fascinating.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.062 align:middle line:10%
I mean, looking at that
on a subliminal level.

00:27:59.062 --> 00:28:00.520 align:middle line:10%
But essentially
what you're saying,

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:10%
then, is, A, the
fourth dimension

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.680 align:middle line:10%
is influencing our feelings and
our thoughts into this field,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:10%
and that we are more
collectively connected by mind

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.537 align:middle line:10%
than we give
ourselves credit for.

00:28:13.537 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.828 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the trick
with the fourth dimension--

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and after all of this
struggle with things,

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.402 align:middle line:84%
including Zecharia
Sitchin's work--

00:28:21.402 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of gotten to the
point where I feel like I really

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:90%
understand it.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the facts are,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.589 align:middle line:84%
like an Oreo cookie, we're
sandwiched between the second

00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:31.630 align:middle line:90%
and the fourth dimension.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.460 align:middle line:90%
We're right in between here.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we're having to
deal with earthquakes,

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and volcanoes, and
earth movements,

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and all the second
dimensional forces coming out.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth
dimensional forces

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:46.386 align:middle line:84%
are just as palpable for us, but
they're emotionally palpable.

00:28:46.386 --> 00:28:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you
think about it, what's

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:50.800 align:middle line:84%
the most difficult
part of anybody's life?

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Emotion.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Emotions.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, right.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So the fourth
dimension is the most--

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.740 align:middle line:84%
the reason I think we
didn't do much with it

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.340 align:middle line:84%
before is it's such a difficult
to dimension to deal with.

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So our emotions
are being influenced and even

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.606 align:middle line:90%
manipulated from the fourth?

00:29:05.606 --> 00:29:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: See, that's
where it gets interesting.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:90%
That's where it's up to us.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So regarding the
fourth dimension,

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.290 align:middle line:84%
what goes on, as
far as I can tell,

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.140 align:middle line:84%
is these five other
dimensions, higher dimensions,

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.500 align:middle line:84%
are continually penetrating
the fourth dimension.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
get to us in 3-D,

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.600 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go through
the fourth dimension.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth dimension is
polarized into dark and light.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And so once we start
getting impulsed by it,

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
it comes to us by
means of our feelings.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need
to do is we need

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:84%
to become really accurate
readers of our own feelings.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:90%
We need to start--

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's just like anything.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just like any other
learning curve in life.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
If you really concentrate
on what you're feeling,

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and if you're not drugged out
and getting drunk all the time

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you're
doing, and if you really

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.160 align:middle line:84%
attune to your feelings
and really pick up

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.560 align:middle line:84%
on your feelings, then
the higher energies

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.770 align:middle line:84%
start to come through--
inspiration, art, creativity.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you're deadening your
consciousness, your feelings,

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
if you're constantly
like putting it down

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.710 align:middle line:84%
through addictions or
addictive behavior or whatever,

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.500 align:middle line:84%
then you're stuffing your
feelings, and it won't work.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.596 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But the
thing is-- if we're--

00:30:17.596 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:10%
when you start the
book, you talk about--

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.540 align:middle line:10%
this chapter on fourth
dimension, you say,

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.750 align:middle line:10%
how do know your
feelings are your own?

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:10%
If we are this connected, in
terms of our collective mind,

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:10%
how do you begin separating
your feelings out

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.450 align:middle line:10%
from something that's
influencing you

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:33.290 align:middle line:10%
and part of the collective?

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: That's
what's called

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:84%
learning how to operate
with the fourth dimension.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
fourth dimension

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:84%
is like a gigantic
navigational zone.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.967 align:middle line:84%
And if you really work with it
and you really observe yourself

00:30:44.967 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and observe what's going on, you
can tell whether something is

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.770 align:middle line:84%
your own feeling
or somebody else's.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:53.070 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is we are
being influenced all the time

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.810 align:middle line:90%
by the feelings of others.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And then the media is
constantly manipulating us

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:90%
through those feelings.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So there's
something higher, deeper,

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.880 align:middle line:10%
truer in ourselves
that would essentially

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:10%
be our yardstick for whether
or not a feeling is our own.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.120 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.422 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, this
is our dimension right here.

00:31:12.422 --> 00:31:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: We're
sovereign in this dimension.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And we get to choose
what we're going to do.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you have a
feeling about something,

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.560 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to do it.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It's your choice as to
whether you do it or not.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the feelings are
constantly impacting us,

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.750 align:middle line:84%
but if we start to recognize
that we are sovereign

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:33.300 align:middle line:84%
in our dimension-- but it
takes a tremendous amount

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.310 align:middle line:84%
of personal growth and personal
commitment, doesn't it?

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.510 align:middle line:10%
And the story, such
as "The Slave Species"

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.749 align:middle line:10%
that we supposedly are,
really diminishes our ability

00:31:43.749 --> 00:31:45.165 align:middle line:10%
to have that kind
of sovereignty--

00:31:45.165 --> 00:31:46.230 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --over ourselves.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.725 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:31:47.725 --> 00:31:48.850 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about where--

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes us
highly exploitable.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --where
have the Annunaki gone?

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.846 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: You know,
as far as I'm concerned

00:31:53.846 --> 00:31:58.260 align:middle line:84%
they're in the media, they're in
the medical programs, they're--

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:84%
the Annunaki, the god-- let's
call it the god program instead

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:90%
of the Annunaki.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the same
program in any culture.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.120 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just Sumerian.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened
is these belief

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.220 align:middle line:84%
systems have penetrated
the systems that we use.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we have
to start distinguishing

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.760 align:middle line:90%
what are we buying into.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean one of the most--

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's trying
to question it, yeah.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:20.593 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: One of the
most profitable industries

00:32:20.593 --> 00:32:22.590 align:middle line:84%
in the world, ever, is
the cancer industry.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:25.336 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So what
are we buying into?

00:32:25.336 --> 00:32:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, let me add-- this
might be slightly off topic--

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.350 align:middle line:10%
but let me ask you, what
in the world of science

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.390 align:middle line:10%
and more quantum physics--

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.910 align:middle line:10%
Michio Kaku and the guys, right?

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:37.710 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Mm-hm.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How do they
describe the attributes--

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.025 align:middle line:10%
or do they even try
to describe attributes

00:32:42.025 --> 00:32:43.025 align:middle line:10%
of the fourth dimension?

00:32:43.025 --> 00:32:43.825 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: No.

00:32:43.825 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Or is it just
simply a frequency range

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.940 align:middle line:10%
that they have identified
with no attributes?

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, as you
know, Einstein's definition,

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.749 align:middle line:84%
scientific definition, of the
fourth dimension is different.

00:32:52.749 --> 00:32:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So the system I'm working with
is just a different system.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And so, as far as scientists
are concerned and extremely

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.310 align:middle line:84%
rational people, one
of the attributes

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.280 align:middle line:84%
of this period of time
where we're mutating out

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.760 align:middle line:84%
of this super-rational
phase of human consciousness

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:17.430 align:middle line:84%
is that people like scientists
and very logical people

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:21.810 align:middle line:84%
basically have a strong tendency
to try to completely ignore

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:25.140 align:middle line:90%
fourth dimensional impulses.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.240 align:middle line:84%
For example-- what
would be a good example?

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:84%
When you're trying to understand
how the fourth dimension

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:84%
functions, dark and
light, the best way

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.450 align:middle line:84%
to start to figure
out how it works

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.460 align:middle line:84%
is by means of the
dark and light.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if you're an extremely
rational scientific person,

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.575 align:middle line:84%
you just deny that
any of that's real.

00:33:43.575 --> 00:33:44.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.980 align:middle line:90%
But it is real.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And they are being impacted--
the extremely rational type

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.540 align:middle line:90%
people--

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.360 align:middle line:84%
are being impacted
constantly by these impulses

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.100 align:middle line:90%
as much as anybody else.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
But what they do is they
have a logical mechanism

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.950 align:middle line:84%
in their brain that denies
that things are real.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So right now we're living with
this complex scientific basic

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.060 align:middle line:84%
control of the planet where
certain things are simply

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:84%
not real, even
though they are real.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:13.149 align:middle line:84%
And they're real for
lots and lots of people.

00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.949 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But
the people who are

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.860 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the
pyramid in control

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.990 align:middle line:84%
are in a position to
declare what's real or not.

00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:22.409 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: A lot.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.919 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Am I mistaken in
that later in the chapter

00:34:24.919 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:10%
on the fourth
dimension in your book,

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.230 align:middle line:10%
"The Alchemy of
Nine Dimensions,"

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.810 align:middle line:10%
you talk about how the beings
in the fourth dimension--

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.800 align:middle line:10%
or you can call them
"elite" or "beings"--

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.590 align:middle line:10%
that manipulate from that
dimension actually do not like

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:41.250 align:middle line:10%
the process of logic
and being rational,

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.920 align:middle line:10%
that that doesn't work
well for them because they

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.730 align:middle line:10%
can't manipulate.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.844 align:middle line:10%
So is there some hidden benefit
to not allowing themselves to--

00:34:47.844 --> 00:34:49.260 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah,
there could be.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --experience it?

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.126 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, OK.

00:34:51.126 --> 00:34:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Look who's got all the power
and the money at this point--

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.850 align:middle line:90%
the most rational people.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So it's
just a phase right now.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:58.290 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:84%
We're just in a
phase of that, which

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.880 align:middle line:84%
is making it very, very
hard for the people who

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.780 align:middle line:90%
aren't that rational.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.154 align:middle line:84%
For the people who are a lot
more artistic and intuitive,

00:35:06.154 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:90%
it's a pretty hard time.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But let's watch closely to
see what goes on with science.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:15.390 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, because
there's such profound denial

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.960 align:middle line:84%
of other levels of reality,
science can tend to go mad

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.090 align:middle line:90%
and can tend to go evil.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Because if you deny the things
that are actually real and are

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.640 align:middle line:90%
actually happening then--

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These
dualistic forces.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --eventually
you can go pretty crazy.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.760 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And there's
a lot of mad scientists.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:31.270 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.980 align:middle line:90%
They really are.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.310 align:middle line:84%
They're living in a
world that doesn't

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.020 align:middle line:84%
have much to do
with anything that's

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.460 align:middle line:90%
going to do anybody any good.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's like, look
to the transhumanist movement.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.010 align:middle line:84%
As far as I'm concerned,
that's one expression of it.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.140 align:middle line:10%
But also in the
fourth dimension it's

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.040 align:middle line:10%
credited with being the
home of the Akashic Records.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.374 align:middle line:10%
So talk about that a little bit.

00:35:49.374 --> 00:35:51.748 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Actually, I meant
to talk to you about that.

00:35:51.748 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic Records
are actually contained

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.850 align:middle line:90%
in the first dimension.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:56.230 align:middle line:90%
That's where they're stored.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But in the fourth
dimension, because everybody

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.680 align:middle line:84%
is relating to everybody else,
because everybody's lifetime is

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.017 align:middle line:84%
intermeshed with
everybody else's lifetime,

00:36:04.017 --> 00:36:05.100 align:middle line:90%
then that information is--

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
they're accessed.

00:36:06.035 --> 00:36:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: It's in the
fourth dimension, yeah.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.110 align:middle line:10%
And then another
expression of it

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:16.720 align:middle line:10%
tends to be kind of angelic
realms, guides, and so forth.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:10%
Talk about those attributes
of the fourth dimension

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.332 align:middle line:10%
and how it interfaces us.

00:36:20.332 --> 00:36:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, that was
a very interesting point.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Because in my system,
the fourth dimension

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:90%
is an even number, number four.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the sixth dimension
is, and the eighth dimension.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And so in my system
the higher guides

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.720 align:middle line:84%
are actually coming
from the sixth dimension

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.300 align:middle line:90%
and the eighth dimension.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And then, just like anything
else, in order to get to us

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and to communicate with
us, and connect with us,

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:45.980 align:middle line:84%
they have to go through
the fourth dimension.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
beings that are actually

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:84%
a very high consciousness
often will come through and be

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.610 align:middle line:84%
described as religious
figures in others

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.200 align:middle line:84%
who pick up on something
that we think is God.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But what we're missing
is we're missing

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.530 align:middle line:84%
the really high frequency
and high fine dimensionality,

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:07.442 align:middle line:90%
a really divine consciousness.

00:37:07.442 --> 00:37:09.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And do they
have to essentially lower

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.740 align:middle line:10%
their frequencies
in their presences

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.430 align:middle line:10%
to be able to
communicate with us then.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: They don't.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they can
be seen as anything?

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: They don't.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:90%
What happens is our--

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.380 align:middle line:84%
you or I-- we're
running in the frequency

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:90%
of the fourth dimension.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So if your consciousness
is really high, then,

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.420 align:middle line:84%
when a divine being
wants to contact you,

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.460 align:middle line:84%
it just moves right
through you and right

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:84%
through the fourth dimension and
right into the third dimension.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.416 align:middle line:84%
And if you got a really
divine inspiration,

00:37:36.416 --> 00:37:38.290 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't tend to
interpret it as Yahweh--

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: --Jehovah, right?

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, no.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: OK.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.940 align:middle line:84%
But millions of
people on the planet,

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:84%
if they get any kind of
impulse of higher energy,

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.210 align:middle line:84%
they would think
that it is Jehovah.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: You
see how that works?

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
that's the conditioning.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.341 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you
actually said in the book

00:37:53.341 --> 00:37:55.810 align:middle line:10%
that there are beings
such as Yahweh and Zeus

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:58.240 align:middle line:10%
that may actually have
been somehow a fabrication

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.761 align:middle line:10%
of our collective mind.

00:37:59.761 --> 00:38:00.760 align:middle line:10%
Can you talk about that?

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.820 align:middle line:10%
Because that's-- now we're
getting into classic mythology

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.260 align:middle line:10%
and the beings in that realm.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's a fascinating period.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And that actually, in
terms of Gebser's work,

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:12.220 align:middle line:84%
that goes back to the issue
of the mythical point.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as the mythical
phrase came in, then,

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:20.170 align:middle line:84%
for a couple thousand years,
we saw these different beings

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:21.760 align:middle line:84%
in these different
higher dimensions.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And, really, we
personified them basically.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the Greek
pantheon is especially

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.230 align:middle line:84%
fun, with the gods
fighting with each other,

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and taking their girlfriends,
and all that kind of stuff.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the stories
of the gods in Greek mythology,

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.980 align:middle line:84%
they mirror the stories
of human behavior.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's a way for people to
play with those archetypes.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And so, in a healthy culture--

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and one of my favorite
healthy cultures

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.200 align:middle line:84%
is the Minoan culture,
only because it's

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.880 align:middle line:84%
a fairly recent culture,
Minoan culture back in 1500 BC.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And the whole culture
was dedicated to art.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:84%
It was dedicated
to mystery plays,

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and making art, and
painting, and all that.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.476 align:middle line:84%
Because if you playing
with these archetypes,

00:39:04.476 --> 00:39:05.350 align:middle line:90%
they're a lot of fun.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:84%
You could have a lot
of fun with them.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.772 align:middle line:84%
But if their denied, they
start to become demonized.

00:39:09.772 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
was going to say.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.063 align:middle line:84%
Then where does the
demonic realm come from?

00:39:13.063 --> 00:39:14.100 align:middle line:90%
The same place?

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: That's
a good question.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.670 align:middle line:90%
And I think it comes from--

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.461 align:middle line:84%
I think it comes from
the lower dimensions,

00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:19.817 align:middle line:90%
from the second dimension.

00:39:19.817 --> 00:39:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think for a certain
number of people--

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm playing with this in
fiction, a really great thing

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.412 align:middle line:90%
to play with in fiction--

00:39:25.412 --> 00:39:27.370 align:middle line:84%
for a certain number of
people, when the forces

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.230 align:middle line:84%
come from the second
dimension, they

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:33.220 align:middle line:84%
can have experiences,
demonic type experiences.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.156 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very,
very complex topic.

00:39:36.156 --> 00:39:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: As you know.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:41.011 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But what can happen
is that people can literally

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:42.660 align:middle line:90%
have demonic type experiences.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:45.716 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the Egyptians

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:47.410 align:middle line:10%
and how some of the
beings showed up

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.710 align:middle line:10%
at that period of time and
the presence of these animal

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:51.930 align:middle line:10%
representations of the gods.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:52.730 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason that
the Egyptian consciousness

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and pantheon is
so valuable to us

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.670 align:middle line:90%
is that it goes back to more--

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:84%
it goes back to more like
1500 BC to about 4000 BC.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.410 align:middle line:84%
It goes back further,
even in Sumerian culture,

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:90%
as far as I'm concerned.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I mean, the
Hermetics would say that

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.490 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian culture
extends back--

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:11.664 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:40:11.664 --> 00:40:12.360 align:middle line:90%
It goes way back before--

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --a couple hundred
thousand years, yeah.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.540 align:middle line:84%
But the way I would put
it is, because things are

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.980 align:middle line:84%
so well-preserved in Egypt
because the climate is so dry,

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and because it's
such an ancient--

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian civilization
appears to have

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:28.010 align:middle line:84%
been a relatively cohesive,
peaceful civilization

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.950 align:middle line:84%
for 2,000 or 3,000 years,
which is way beyond anybody

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:32.730 align:middle line:90%
else on the planet.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So because it goes back
to that earlier period,

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:41.060 align:middle line:84%
it's a much more pure
and spiritual rendition

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:44.240 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual cultures,
just because of its age.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.395 align:middle line:84%
It goes back, actually,
to the age of Taurus.

00:40:46.395 --> 00:40:48.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, and there's
some proof there, also,

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.747 align:middle line:10%
in the fact that it was
peaceful for those years.

00:40:50.747 --> 00:40:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the Egyptian
culture seems

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:57.080 align:middle line:84%
to have had a good
hierarchy with people

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.960 align:middle line:84%
with workers, and artists,
and pharaohs, and all that.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.602 align:middle line:84%
They seemed to have been a
fairly egalitarian culture.

00:41:02.602 --> 00:41:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
don't think that's true.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But, when I look into it as
far as I can see, it's true.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they had a
fascinating pantheon

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:13.040 align:middle line:84%
that was related to
animal archetypes.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And where this
comes from is-- this

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.730 align:middle line:84%
is something not a lot
of people know about,

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.800 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's
utterly fascinating.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.040 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians had a
gigantic zoo on the Nile

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:28.400 align:middle line:84%
that could have been 300 to
500 miles long on the Nile.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.980 align:middle line:90%
This goes back to like 3000 BC.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And they kept all
the animals there--

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.270 align:middle line:84%
the hippopotamus,
and the eagles,

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.800 align:middle line:90%
and everything that they had.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was Egyptian
priests spent their whole life

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.870 align:middle line:90%
studying a particular animal.

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And they would study the
intelligence of that animal,

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:47.450 align:middle line:84%
because each animal has a
different type of intelligence.

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians felt that
if human beings were going

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:55.280 align:middle line:84%
to have a really high,
multifaceted, really

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.830 align:middle line:84%
complex consciousness,
they needed

00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:59.847 align:middle line:84%
to have the intelligence
of the animals.

00:41:59.847 --> 00:42:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And so people would
actually-- priests

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.830 align:middle line:84%
would actually meditate
with the animals,

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and teach about
different animals,

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:10.670 align:middle line:84%
like Anubis or like Sati
or something like that.

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And they would teach people
how to have the intelligence

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:14.620 align:middle line:90%
of that animal.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we see that
in indigenous culture,

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.750 align:middle line:84%
like in North America and first
nations, where people have

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.060 align:middle line:84%
animal clans and
people identify,

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:84%
like with the turtle clan or
the eagle clan or whatever.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:29.450 align:middle line:84%
They're identifying with the
intelligence of that animal.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what this is telling
us is that part of being human

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.290 align:middle line:84%
is having these different
facets of animal consciousness.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet those became
known as deities themselves--

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, that's right.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --these
representations.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Because they were
considered to be deities, why?

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Because they were intelligent.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.120 align:middle line:90%
And so they understood.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you start to
think about what it takes,

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:53.240 align:middle line:84%
for example, for swans to
migrate from the North Pole

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.040 align:middle line:84%
all the way down
to South America,

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and you start to really study
what goes on with animals,

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:00.350 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize just
the extreme intelligence

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.440 align:middle line:90%
of these beings.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so, in
sacred cultures, versus just

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.520 align:middle line:84%
rational cultures, you
see much more respect.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And then what does that create?

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.623 align:middle line:84%
People are less likely
to destroy species.

00:43:11.623 --> 00:43:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So
one of the reasons

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.830 align:middle line:84%
we're having such a terrible
problem with species being

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.110 align:middle line:84%
destroyed is people
don't realize they're

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.070 align:middle line:90%
destroying their own minds.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.040 align:middle line:84%
They're destroying
their own habitat

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.320 align:middle line:90%
and their own intelligence.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.310 align:middle line:10%
Very good points.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:10%
Going back just
for a moment, too,

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.060 align:middle line:10%
to the egalitarian
nature of those

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.150 align:middle line:10%
dynasties in Egypt, the ones
that we're more aware of.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.960 align:middle line:10%
There's certain
archaeological evidence

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.130 align:middle line:10%
that the people were not
treated as slaves at that time,

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.410 align:middle line:10%
the workers on the
great edifices and such

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.500 align:middle line:10%
had adequate housing,
protein, and so forth,

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.360 align:middle line:10%
and this was a
job like any other

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.020 align:middle line:10%
at any other point in history.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.402 align:middle line:10%
So it wasn't based on slavery.

00:43:51.402 --> 00:43:52.402 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:52.402 --> 00:43:54.777 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I don't know if
that's your take on it, or--

00:43:54.777 --> 00:43:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well,
I think that one

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:84%
of the things in the historical
record that has really

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.940 align:middle line:84%
screwed a lot of
stuff up is the Hebrew

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.243 align:middle line:90%
bad rap on the Egyptians.

00:44:03.243 --> 00:44:03.586 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:03.586 --> 00:44:04.544 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:44:04.544 --> 00:44:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And the whole bad
rap coming from the Exodus.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And then what was lost was
through this negative attitude

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.530 align:middle line:84%
towards Egyptians
was the awareness

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.580 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians were
really an egalitarian culture.

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And when the Hebrews started to
come into Egypt, maybe 2000 BC,

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:25.150 align:middle line:84%
something like that, they
weren't nearly as developed

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:90%
as the Egyptians at all.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is they
didn't recognize-- really

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:32.510 align:middle line:84%
recognize-- the beauty of
what they were experiencing.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a
beautiful culture.

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.758 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So there's another
issue with animals, Regina,

00:44:37.758 --> 00:44:38.780 align:middle line:90%
that's interesting.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.260 align:middle line:84%
We now have the discovery
of Gobekli Tepe,

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.765 align:middle line:90%
which is the site in Turkey.

00:44:43.765 --> 00:44:44.723 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Turkey, yeah.

00:44:44.723 --> 00:44:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Which has been
carbon dated to 9400 BC--

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.070 align:middle line:84%
right after the
cataclysm, by the way--

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:50.930 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And Gobekli Tepe has
all these pillars on it

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:57.410 align:middle line:84%
with all these animals, these
raised relief animals on it.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And so we can see that even
12,000 years ago in temples,

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:04.370 align:middle line:84%
people were honoring the animals
and working with the animals.

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And then what we know
from Gobekli Tepe,

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.580 align:middle line:84%
because of Andrew
Collins, we know

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that what was going
on at Gobekli Tepe

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.800 align:middle line:84%
was the animal
images on the pillars

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:84%
are actually related to
the animals of the zodiac.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so we start to
get to realize that this animal

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:25.030 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is no
only on the earth,

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:26.795 align:middle line:90%
but it's also in the sky.

00:45:26.795 --> 00:45:28.170 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you could go back

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.040 align:middle line:90%
into this early consciousness.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And we see this profound
honoring of nature

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and the animals, which is what
we just have to get back to.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Just quickly, as an
aside, Andrew, yourself,

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:47.039 align:middle line:84%
which culture did he believe
Gobekli Tepe was a remnant of?

00:45:47.039 --> 00:45:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: He thinks that it's
a remnant of the Aurignacian

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.070 align:middle line:84%
culture that I
mentioned earlier.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.265 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: And so do I.

00:45:52.265 --> 00:45:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.805 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: So do I, yeah.

00:45:53.805 --> 00:45:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that the Aurignacian
people were seafarers.

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.520 align:middle line:84%
They were sailing all
over the place from Europe

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.090 align:middle line:90%
over to America, all that stuff.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to
have done-- in fact,

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:07.720 align:middle line:84%
they may be late remnants of
the Atlanteans, of course.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you never know, once you
go back before the cataclysm,

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.670 align:middle line:84%
are we talking about
Atlanteans, or are we

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.190 align:middle line:90%
talking about Aurignacian.

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.178 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But we
do have a pretty good

00:46:16.178 --> 00:46:19.690 align:middle line:84%
archaeological
record on those guys.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:22.190 align:middle line:84%
It would appear
that they probably--

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:25.000 align:middle line:84%
but it was built right
after the cataclysm.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's important.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.010 align:middle line:10%
Obviously it's some
attempt to save--

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --knowledge
that they still had.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And it became a record of the
knowledge 11,500 years ago.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:35.740 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:35.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:36.910 align:middle line:10%
It is amazing.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:40.360 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I'd love to interview
Andrew on that sometime.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Hard to get to.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: (LAUGHING) Maybe
you can arrange that.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:45.089 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, I wrote
an article about that

00:46:45.089 --> 00:46:48.400 align:middle line:84%
because my issue with Gobekli
Tepe is, I think they also--

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.260 align:middle line:84%
the pillars are also
showing postures.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
so, in other words,

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I think that when we come
back after the cataclysm

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and we get beyond survivalism,
one of the first things we see

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.020 align:middle line:90%
is the sacred postures.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:46:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:01.930 align:middle line:10%
Yes, the re-emergence of
those sacred postures.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:02.680 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Well, we'll continue.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.520 align:middle line:90%
We can do another talk on that.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.936 align:middle line:84%
Because that was something I
do want to talk to you about.

00:47:08.936 --> 00:47:10.829 align:middle line:10%
But now we'll continue
on the 4-D subject.

00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:12.370 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
you mentioned--

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:18.137 align:middle line:10%
you just tapped on earlier-- is
that 4-D exists as a duality.

00:47:18.137 --> 00:47:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Not a duality-- yeah, a duality.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Black and white
playing off of each other.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: That's right.

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.480 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about that.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.070 align:middle line:10%
What happens to
us as humans when

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.160 align:middle line:10%
we choose to play on or
off one side or the other,

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.600 align:middle line:10%
or align with just one of
the sides in a duality?

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, the
goal with the duality issue

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.610 align:middle line:90%
is to have it be a polarity.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:44.925 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have
an issue between--

00:47:44.925 --> 00:47:46.620 align:middle line:84%
what would be a good
example-- usually

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.640 align:middle line:84%
it's an emotional
dynamic of some kind.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.280 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you have a
severe father complex

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.230 align:middle line:90%
and a severe father issue.

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And so in the early stages when
you're trying to resolve it,

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:59.550 align:middle line:84%
in your mind you go, he's
either this or he's either that.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And then as you
start to develop more

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and you start to grow more,
you start to realize, well, no.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:05.920 align:middle line:90%
He's not this or that.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.270 align:middle line:90%
He's both.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And then as you
develop an issue more,

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.790 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a polarity where you
can see the whole range of what

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:13.810 align:middle line:90%
an issue is.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Because just think of the
complexity of, for instance,

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.780 align:middle line:84%
the relationship of a
daughter and a father.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And so all of us have
various complexes

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.710 align:middle line:84%
because we are attempting
to grow more in that area.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.814 align:middle line:84%
And if we just say something
is black or white--

00:48:29.814 --> 00:48:31.480 align:middle line:84%
he's good or he's
bad-- you're not going

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.560 align:middle line:90%
to get very far with that.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
saying that that actually

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.190 align:middle line:84%
limits the access to our
own higher consciousness

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.990 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:38.365 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: The
fourth dimension

00:48:38.365 --> 00:48:39.750 align:middle line:90%
is meant to be a real polarity.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And the keepers of
the fourth dimension

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:46.480 align:middle line:84%
are there to create
the space for people

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.390 align:middle line:84%
to examine all
elements of a dynamic.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Now then, of course,
I immediately

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.120 align:middle line:84%
went, when I understood
that to some extent,

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.640 align:middle line:84%
was, well, why does
it work that way?

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you think about it,
we're all electromagnetic.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And we know from physics, for
example, that the particles

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:06.230 align:middle line:90%
split and things like that.

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just the
very nature of reality

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.050 align:middle line:84%
to have things split
into dualities.

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.810 align:middle line:84%
But our job as humans
in the third dimension

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:15.527 align:middle line:84%
is to bring that
all together into--

00:49:15.527 --> 00:49:17.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To create a
state of coherence again.

00:49:17.485 --> 00:49:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --a
complex polarity.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the real richness
actually comes from those

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:23.260 align:middle line:90%
areas of the dark and the light.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So one of the countries that
I really enjoy teaching in

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:26.800 align:middle line:90%
is Bali.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Because Bali continues
to have constant mystery

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:32.997 align:middle line:84%
plays of the dark and
light and the dark gods

00:49:32.997 --> 00:49:34.330 align:middle line:90%
and the light gods and all that.

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:35.540 align:middle line:90%
And they play with it.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.340 align:middle line:90%
The understand it.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do they reconcile it?

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Pardon?

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they find a
way to reconcile it in this?

00:49:40.155 --> 00:49:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Oh, yeah.

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.960 align:middle line:84%
The mystery plays
always resolve it.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Somebody
learns something,

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:45.550 align:middle line:90%
or a being will learn something.

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.091 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but
at the same time,

00:49:47.091 --> 00:49:49.450 align:middle line:10%
when people start
receiving these impulses

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:51.550 align:middle line:10%
from the fourth dimension,
they oftentimes,

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:54.640 align:middle line:10%
as you say in your
book, ignore them.

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.760 align:middle line:10%
And why is it we're so resistant
to these messages, which

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.027 align:middle line:10%
seems to be where we are
right now as a species?

00:50:01.027 --> 00:50:03.610 align:middle line:10%
There are exceptions, of course,
that are growing out of this.

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:07.240 align:middle line:10%
But really stuck and resistant.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well, if you
start examining your feelings,

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:11.930 align:middle line:90%
you have to grow.

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you could just
stuff your feeling,

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.310 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to grow.

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's always
a strong tendency

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.320 align:middle line:90%
for people not to grow.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is the feeling

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:23.640 align:middle line:90%
gets stronger and stronger.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.590 align:middle line:90%
And finally you can't deny it.

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And then usually with
feelings what happens

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.440 align:middle line:90%
is it shows up in a partner.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.040 align:middle line:84%
We attract a partner to us
who's going to play out--

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This drama.

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --a whole a
range of-- filling with drama.

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:34.350 align:middle line:90%
The duality.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:36.016 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Try to
deny-- that's right.

00:50:36.016 --> 00:50:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And so this whole emotional
realm that we live in

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.890 align:middle line:84%
is this complex
emotional dynamic.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And there is definitely a strong
tendency to try to avoid it.

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're coming out
of the Victorian era

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.390 align:middle line:84%
where they were experts
at denying feelings.

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And so
we in our generation

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and the generation after us is
breaking this tendency down.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Because once people
allowed themselves

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:02.490 align:middle line:84%
to become rigid and
deny their feelings,

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:04.030 align:middle line:90%
then life became very boring.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:06.663 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: You look
at the typical picture

00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:09.940 align:middle line:84%
of a Victorian parlor in
1890 just filled with junk,

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.740 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Because people, they
don't feel anything,

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.520 align:middle line:84%
but they have all that
stuff around them.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we've been
growing beyond that.

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And also, in my lifetime,
by discovering that

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.740 align:middle line:84%
we are a multi-traumatized
species from the cataclysms,

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and we also have been blasting
through feelings of fear

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:30.810 align:middle line:90%
and feelings of denial.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because of this
vulnerability that is

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.510 align:middle line:10%
in the collective mind, the
beings that reach through--

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.390 align:middle line:10%
you have beings reaching through
from the fourth dimension that

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:43.920 align:middle line:10%
are maybe of a lower nature
and also of a higher nature.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.050 align:middle line:10%
Those of a higher nature
are whispering to us

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:51.910 align:middle line:10%
to help inspire us
to open our minds.

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But usually those
inspirations are actually

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:55.280 align:middle line:90%
coming from--

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those
other dimensions.

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --the
higher five dimensions.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:58.851 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And
they'll come through

00:51:58.851 --> 00:52:00.990 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth dimension
to work with it.

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But usually they're
are actually those.

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the point would be
that the more you do work

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.430 align:middle line:84%
with the feelings, and the more
you work through the feelings,

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:11.130 align:middle line:84%
the more open you are to
the higher dimensions.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And then what finally
happens is feelings become

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:16.560 align:middle line:90%
a very different proposition.

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.880 align:middle line:84%
When we're young and we're
in dramas and all that,

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.140 align:middle line:90%
everything is intense.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And you feel a lot.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And then as you
start to get older,

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.350 align:middle line:84%
your sensibilities
become a lot finer.

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
the higher dimensions

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.279 align:middle line:90%
are coming right through.

00:52:28.279 --> 00:52:29.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you
mentioned that this

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:32.837 align:middle line:10%
is where we start moving beyond
the notion of victimhood,

00:52:32.837 --> 00:52:33.670 align:middle line:10%
of being victimized.

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
is a real part of--

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: I can't even--

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of that black

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW:

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --being a victim.

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: --of

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yet--

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: I can't imagine--

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --a huge percentage of
people on the planet still do.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: I know.

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.230 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, it's not true.

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is a victim.

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:50.668 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
people that are watching this

00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:52.200 align:middle line:90%
right now who may be--

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.050 align:middle line:84%
may be still experiencing
feelings of victimhood.

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And how you start discerning
and working your way out

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:58.800 align:middle line:84%
of that-- a little
practical advice

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.690 align:middle line:84%
in working with the
fourth realm now.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I certainly would
say step one is

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:03.900 align:middle line:90%
to realize you're not a victim.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.070 align:middle line:84%
The issue-- you
created it yourself.

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you are is
something that you created.

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:11.250 align:middle line:84%
If you are in a
situation that's making

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you're
a victim, then there's

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.040 align:middle line:84%
a high probability you need to
get out of it or transform it.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have
to be a victim.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you don't.

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:23.820 align:middle line:84%
That's a matter of
actually examining

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.140 align:middle line:90%
what these feelings are.

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Taking them, accepting them, and
then examining them honestly.

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And so if you recall in
the Pleiadian agenda,

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.520 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
the Pleiadian got into

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.450 align:middle line:84%
is to work with feelings
by means of thinking.

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Do
you remember that?

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: In other words,
realize that feelings are real

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.010 align:middle line:90%
and that they mean something.

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And don't just keep
feeling it and feeling it,

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:51.540 align:middle line:84%
but start to really use your
intelligence to really figure

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.430 align:middle line:90%
out what's causing this.

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:54.262 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:54.262 --> 00:53:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Some
people just don't

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.020 align:middle line:84%
think that they can
think about feelings.

00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.334 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:59.334 --> 00:54:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: They
have to feel it.

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.940 align:middle line:84%
You can't not feel
it by thinking.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.100 align:middle line:84%
But then there's the issue
of go ahead and feel it

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.780 align:middle line:90%
and go ahead and feel it hard.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.160 align:middle line:90%
But what's really going on here?

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:10.830 align:middle line:10%
So once we get to
that point, we can

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:12.769 align:middle line:10%
start breaking beyond
the victimization.

00:54:12.769 --> 00:54:14.310 align:middle line:10%
I just bring that
up for anyone still

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:15.670 align:middle line:10%
struggling a little
bit with that--

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:16.050 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Oh, yeah.

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --feeling wronged by--

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: A lot of people
are struggling with it.

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --wronged
by life, still.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:19.946 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: In
fact, what I think

00:54:19.946 --> 00:54:23.220 align:middle line:84%
is really incredible is I watch
what's going on with refugees,

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.810 align:middle line:90%
especially Syrian refugees.

00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:27.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to feel
that they're victims.

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:30.630 align:middle line:84%
They are just on the move, and
they're going to go for it,

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and somehow they're going
to have a better life.

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.785 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
amazing to see that.

00:54:34.785 --> 00:54:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when you think
of what they've been--

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.120 align:middle line:90%
what's been done to them--

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and yet they just figure, OK,
I can't live here anymore.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to find another life.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's really an
amazing thing to watch.

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:47.340 align:middle line:84%
It's too bad we don't have
more information about that.

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like
a wave of people.

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And speaking of
waves of consciousness,

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.690 align:middle line:10%
you also write in your book
about these ecstatic kinds

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:58.230 align:middle line:10%
of cultures start emerging when
there's a real need for change.

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:00.850 align:middle line:10%
And as we talked about
in our other interview,

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:05.340 align:middle line:10%
we're on the precipice of huge
global change in consciousness.

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.550 align:middle line:10%
And let's just-- we only
have just a few minutes left.

00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:09.925 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about
that part of it.

00:55:09.925 --> 00:55:11.424 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Well,
you know, Regina,

00:55:11.424 --> 00:55:13.380 align:middle line:84%
what I would say about
that is I would say,

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:14.910 align:middle line:84%
we really are
starting to come up

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:17.370 align:middle line:84%
against the wall of
organized religions.

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Because organized
religions are going

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:22.690 align:middle line:84%
to continue to keep
people from changing.

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: And yet the
circumstances on the planet--

00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:29.340 align:middle line:84%
regardless of what any
religion thinks or believes--

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.930 align:middle line:90%
you can't avoid changing now.

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:32.570 align:middle line:90%
You can't avoid changing now.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.520 align:middle line:90%
And so we're getting blown--

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.380 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get blown
through belief systems

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:40.687 align:middle line:84%
that we locked into and that we
thought would take care of us.

00:55:40.687 --> 00:55:42.270 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to take care of you.

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:42.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:55:42.765 --> 00:55:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: If you're
a Syrian mother who

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:47.400 align:middle line:84%
has seven children, who's
going to take care of you?

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.850 align:middle line:90%
The church isn't going to.

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: You know?

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:54.600 align:middle line:10%
And so, going back to the
Annunaki for a moment,

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:57.420 align:middle line:10%
is it your understanding
that the Annunaki

00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.340 align:middle line:10%
presence from the
other dimension

00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.990 align:middle line:10%
is what actually established
the notion of religions

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.790 align:middle line:10%
on this planet--

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:03.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes.

00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --for control?

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, definitely.

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone through
that in great detail.

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:09.740 align:middle line:10%
So what happened is that it went
into-- the Babylonian religion

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.790 align:middle line:10%
went into Hebrew religion.

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:14.274 align:middle line:10%
And then it went into
Judeo-Christianity.

00:56:14.274 --> 00:56:16.440 align:middle line:10%
And so what I'm really
interested in, in my own work

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.670 align:middle line:10%
right now, in fiction, is
that point 2,000 years ago

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:21.790 align:middle line:10%
where it transmuted it
into Judeo-Christianity.

00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And we have to start
breaking free of that.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:25.950 align:middle line:84%
We only have a couple
of minutes left.

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:27.780 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
you also talk about

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:32.400 align:middle line:10%
is the fact that relationship
and relationships are a way

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.860 align:middle line:10%
to start overcoming
duality and really

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:38.310 align:middle line:10%
embracing this total
polarity to be experienced

00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:39.310 align:middle line:10%
in this emotional realm.

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:40.643 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, that's right.

00:56:40.643 --> 00:56:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's why relationships
are so powerful for us.

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the minute you're
in a relationship, whatever

00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:49.590 align:middle line:84%
polarity or duality that you
haven't resolved yourself

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:52.830 align:middle line:84%
is going to appearing in your
partner and in the relationship

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:53.650 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:55.525 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
relationships are almost

00:56:55.525 --> 00:56:56.340 align:middle line:90%
like a triangle.

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But they give
you a new view-- a new view

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:00.690 align:middle line:84%
that you can't have if
you're just on your own.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very true.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: So that's why we go
into relationships periodically

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:05.490 align:middle line:90%
or try changing them.

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The most challenging
thing on this planet--

00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yes, it is.

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --are our
relationships with each other.

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are the
most challenging.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And emotional relationships
are the most challenging.

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So we can use
that as a blessing, right?

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:17.510 align:middle line:10%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah.

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:18.310 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:21.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To start learning
it through relationships

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:24.600 align:middle line:10%
and start observing our
own emotions and reactions

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.360 align:middle line:10%
through this past drama, be
it collective or individual.

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.040 align:middle line:10%
We only have a
couple minutes left.

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.810 align:middle line:10%
Again, any final
thoughts on how we

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:34.410 align:middle line:10%
can thwart the manipulation
from the 4-D world that's

00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:37.394 align:middle line:10%
been going on and elevate
ourselves beyond that now.

00:57:37.394 --> 00:57:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: I really
do think the trick

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.460 align:middle line:84%
for people now is to
really start taking

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.380 align:middle line:90%
a look at organized religion.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is for Catholics

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:49.050 align:middle line:84%
to start considering
what's going on with Islam.

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:51.949 align:middle line:84%
For Islamic people to consider
what's going on with--

00:57:51.949 --> 00:57:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'm using those three
religions because those three

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:57.690 align:middle line:84%
religions are all coming down
from Abraham, the father God.

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And those three religions
are creating the conflicts

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:01.780 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.090 align:middle line:90%
And so for people who are--

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not Buddhists.

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: No, they aren't.

00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:07.410 align:middle line:84%
As I said to you, it'd be
easier if we had Buddhists.

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:07.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:07.815 --> 00:58:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: But it's
really important for people

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:11.640 align:middle line:84%
of those three
religions to start

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:15.390 align:middle line:84%
learning about and admiring the
aspects of the other religion,

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:17.130 align:middle line:90%
instead of demonizing them.

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Because if we demonize
the other religion

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:22.070 align:middle line:84%
it just turns into another
duality, another us

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:24.360 align:middle line:90%
against them, and another war.

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's just such
a simple choice on one hand,

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:30.307 align:middle line:84%
yet it seems like
it's lifetimes away.

00:58:30.307 --> 00:58:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: I know.

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.030 align:middle line:84%
It does seem like it,
but I don't think so.

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we're coming
to that breaking point.

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Yeah, I do.

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:41.310 align:middle line:10%
Well, on that note, I just
wanted to thank you again

00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:44.340 align:middle line:10%
for inviting us into your
beautiful home and library

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.920 align:middle line:10%
here, just one of the most
spectacular metaphysical

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.810 align:middle line:10%
and science scientific
libraries I've ever seen.

00:58:49.810 --> 00:58:52.560 align:middle line:10%
And also for us for
allowing us to really go

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.620 align:middle line:10%
into more depth on Annunaki
and your understanding of it.

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Because this is,
I think, will be

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.242 align:middle line:84%
very refreshing and hopefully
freeing for a lot of people.

00:59:00.242 --> 00:59:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: I hope so.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HAND CLOW: Certainly
fear-- certainly fear is not

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:04.110 align:middle line:90%
going to accomplish anything.

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No slave species.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:06.210 align:middle line:90%
We're no one's slave.

00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: No.

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you, Regina.

00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Barbara.

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:11.261 align:middle line:90%
>>HAND CLOW: Thanks for coming.
