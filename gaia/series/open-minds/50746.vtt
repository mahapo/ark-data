>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Have you ever wondered

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.189 align:middle line:10%
if you were given the
correct name at your birth?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes we no longer
resonate with that name,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:10%
and we'll even go so
far as to change it.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.650 align:middle line:84%
According to Nicholas David
Ngan, when we change our name,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:90%
we change our entire life.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:10%
In his book, Your Soul Contract
Decoded, an ancient Hebrew form

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:10%
of numerology is used to tell
us what our life's purpose is

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:10%
by deciphering our name.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And yes, sometimes a
change is in order.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I loved my last
conversation with you.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:90%
So here we go again.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:90%
And this is your life's work.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Your purpose is to help
people understand and empower

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:84%
themselves by working with
this matrix of numerology

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
that I think a lot of people
understand, numerology works.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:84%
You can even go to a
little magazine or even

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:90%
in some newspapers.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's going to be a 2
kind of day or whatnot.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.142 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what you do.

00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NICHOLAS DAVID NGAN:
This is a different sort

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:10%
of numerology, Regina.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:10%
This is based on
using the pure sounds

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:10%
of the movement of a
great spirit or god

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:10%
and the creation of creation.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.242 align:middle line:84%
And it's a work,
actually, that Drunvalo

00:01:34.242 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:84%
has been exploring with
the flower of life.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.466 align:middle line:84%
Out of the symbol of
the flower of life,

00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:84%
which represents the
creator creating,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
we get 22 specific movements,
which have 22 specific Hebrew

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:84%
sounds, or Sanskrit,
or Tibetan sounds,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:84%
the other sacred languages
associated with them.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we match those
sounds to a birth certificate

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:84%
name in whatever
language that is,

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:84%
we then get the true
program, true contract,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.765 align:middle line:84%
what the soul's put
into someone to create

00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:06.926 align:middle line:84%
their life in each moment
by the law of attraction.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know
what's so interesting?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
As you're talking,
and you're talking

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:84%
about the name in each moment,
what just popped into my mind.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that in
our cultures, the culture

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
in the West certainly--
I don't know about all

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.570 align:middle line:84%
of the cultures in
the East and what

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:84%
happens with names when people
marry-- but the woman is

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
constantly having to be
faced with the choice

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
of whether to change
from her maiden name

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.986 align:middle line:90%
to her married name.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you're married more than
once, you have to change again,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.470 align:middle line:90%
or you can choose whether to.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:84%
The nice thing is you get to
choose whether you want that.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But it would seem
that there would

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
be a lot more movement
in the life of women

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.286 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, often
the issue with names

00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:50.956 align:middle line:84%
is an issue of power, where
the masculine energy decides,

00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, you're going to
change your name to mine,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.872 align:middle line:90%
so I have power over you.

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:55.621 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I know
what that part means.

00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's the classical part.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
But looking at it from
what you're talking about,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:90%
whole different thing.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.777 align:middle line:84%
It has a different kind
of meaning and potential.

00:03:03.777 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: What it means there
is that the souls have

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
got together in a
relationship, have already

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:90%
agreed what the names will be.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And often a woman will
enter in a relationship

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.539 align:middle line:84%
to get a specific
frequency of name,

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:84%
because she wants to
grow in a certain way.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Meaning unconsciously.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.556 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Unconsciously.

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Because you can think of the
sounds of the birth certificate

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:84%
name that are like
the cake of your life.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It's what creates your
reality in each moment.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And they radiate out to
the reality or the matrix,

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.602 align:middle line:90%
and it rearranges around that.

00:03:33.602 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the source
of the Law of Attraction.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.677 align:middle line:84%
So if you go and
change your name,

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:84%
it's like putting a layer
of icing over that cake,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
so it infuses a new
set of frequencies

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
that goes into your
original contract

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and can either help you
enhance it and work it

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:90%
through or hinder you.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Or it may have no effect
or somewhere in between,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:90%
depending on what's going on.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So the name change is
for growth or challenge

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:90%
or a mixture of both in life.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, which
a lot of people

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.700 align:middle line:90%
find out when they get married.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.396 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course.

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:03.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yes.

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:04.436 align:middle line:90%
They sure do.

00:04:04.436 --> 00:04:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] And so
this is spiritual numerology

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:90%
of Moses, is what it is called.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And Frank Alper
was your teacher.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:10%
Tell us a little bit about
Frank Alper, the original system

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.043 align:middle line:10%
he used and then how you
started embracing and using it.

00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:10%
>>NGAN: What
happened with this is

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle line:10%
that I discovered the system.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I walked into a hotel room
in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1990.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.549 align:middle line:84%
I was drawn to come
to his workshop called

00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:90%
"The Carousel of Growth."

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know why.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:90%
I just knew I had to be there.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled out
a star of David.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me
what my birth name

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:90%
was, birth certificate name was.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.680 align:middle line:84%
He added Hebrew
sounds to that name.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And Hebrew numbers come
out of those sounds,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the major
differences between this system

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.957 align:middle line:84%
and normal Pythagorean
numerology.

00:04:52.957 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And Hebrew numbers and
letters have the same sound

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:90%
and the same symbol.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.094 align:middle line:84%
There is no allocation of
numbers to the Roman alphabet.

00:05:00.094 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're dealing with the pure
frequencies of God, really,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:84%
when we use this
system, so probably

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:84%
the highest level of truth
you can have in this reality.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.305 align:middle line:84%
And so what he did is
he decoded my numbers

00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:90%
on the Star of David.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And he went about in one hour
explaining my entire life.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
He took all the
disparate experiences

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I had, all the confusing stuff,
all the challenging stuff,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and said, here's
why it all happened.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he recognized
the other unique aspect of you,

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
in that your soul chose to
come into this body at 12

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.914 align:middle line:90%
years of age?

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Oh, that
came along later.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That came later.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Because he just saw
these qualities of you.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: It was all in the chart,
that my personality, my body,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.195 align:middle line:84%
was living these
out, very viscerally.

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:44.789 align:middle line:84%
And so that just was like one
of those real aha moments,

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:84%
one of those things
you never forget,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.490 align:middle line:90%
like the birth of a child.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.448 align:middle line:90%
It's one of those days.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:90%
You just never forget that day.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
It was burned into
my consciousness.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I have
to learn how to do this.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I stayed on for
another six weeks in America

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.602 align:middle line:84%
to actually go on the
training for this workshop.

00:06:00.602 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And the way it all
started for him was he

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
was just driving, probably to
Sedona, somewhere in Arizona--

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.571 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Probably.

00:06:07.571 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.976 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: --knowing him.

00:06:08.976 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And it came to him that in
Hebrew numbers and letters

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
have the same sound
and same frequency.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
was that the soul of Moses

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:84%
spent nine months channeling
to him the meaning of the 22

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
numbers of Hebrew that
are used in the system.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.204 align:middle line:84%
Each of the 22 numbers has
a specific characteristic

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that we use in the
Soul Contract reading

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
work, which is
what I've named it.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I try to differentiate
it from normal numerology

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
but also to say more
what it actually did.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.351 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Soul contracts.

00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.974 align:middle line:90%
Identifying soul contracts.

00:06:39.974 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So literally
what the soul brings in

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.870 align:middle line:90%
to create your life.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And so basically he brought
it in at a very high,

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:90%
esoteric level.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.766 align:middle line:84%
And what I've tried to do
along with Ahlmeirah Ariel

00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Hallaire, who I work with
to develop this work-- so we

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:84%
expanded it based on thousands
of readings with people

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
over the past 35 years,
40 years, of combined

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:90%
work between the two of us.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we work with
a lot of people

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.685 align:middle line:84%
with the system at a
healing level as well.

00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And we use this to guide
us in working with them

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.595 align:middle line:84%
so they would understand how to
navigate their soul contract.

00:07:15.595 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And based on that, we got
an enormous understanding

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
of how this actually
manifests in real life.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we expanded
these interpretations.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I had about 12 pages
from Frank, typewritten.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.380 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And he spent his time
and just talked about it.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's it.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And you've developed
all of this from there.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, those are good bones to
work with, though, as they say,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:90%
a good framework.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Good framework.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, you
know, one thing that's

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:84%
popping into my mind
also is that years ago,

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
when I realized I could speak to
other beings, into other realms

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:90%
and such-- I could listen.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I could listen, ask questions
and listen to answers.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:84%
One thing that came
up is that I seem

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
to have this real
attachment-- not attachment,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:84%
but love of helping people
identify their names,

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:84%
especially unborn
children before they

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.240 align:middle line:90%
came into this plane.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's really
not my business.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.817 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's between the
soul and their parents.

00:08:08.817 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But there was this one
situation I remember,

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and I bring it up because
it exemplifies how strongly

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:84%
this soul wanted
this particular name.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was my sister.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.309 align:middle line:90%
She was having a baby.

00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know
the sex of the baby yet

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and didn't want to
until the baby was born.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.876 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
speaking to the baby.

00:08:28.876 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a one-week window
before they're born

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and after people
die where I seem

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.200 align:middle line:84%
to be able to tap in when
they're right around the body.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And this baby was telling me
about what it was coming here

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:84%
for, what it wanted to
experience, what it loved.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
At 25 years old now,
she's all of those things.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:90%
She's very strong.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And the being said, I
came here for the name--

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't if it was
Alexander or Alexandra.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't giving me
its sex yet at this time.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I called my
sister the next morning.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.319 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, what
a beautiful name.

00:09:07.319 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I called my sister.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, Denise, have you
and your husband Norbert

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
thought about the
name of the baby yet?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:84%
She said, as a matter of
fact, yes, last night.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Both of us just-- boom-- we
decided on a name last night.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well what is it?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I said, because I got
one last night, too.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
it's Alexandra

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.590 align:middle line:84%
if it's a girl and then
Alexander if it's a boy.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And so this being
was so powerful, they

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:84%
were able to get through to all
of us and say, that is my name.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's a strong name.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to turn
into a very strong woman when

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.479 align:middle line:90%
she gets a little older.

00:09:45.479 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
What happens there is the
soul, prior to incarnation,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.300 align:middle line:90%
it looks at its past lives.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And it says, of
all the themes I've

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:84%
been exploring many
lifetimes, what would I

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
like to explore this
time, what variation?

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Because often we repeat
themes in different ways.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.614 align:middle line:84%
We play different roles
in the same family group.

00:10:02.614 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's already designed
probably two or three names

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.529 align:middle line:84%
that would, through
the Law of Attraction,

00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:84%
basically create what, in
this case, she would like.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And so at the point of
incarnation, usually

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
at conception, we get quite
a lot of the soul comes in,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.607 align:middle line:84%
but it continues
through the pregnancy.

00:10:16.607 --> 00:10:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.807 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: She's telepathing
to the close family.

00:10:19.807 --> 00:10:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Because she knows who's
going to have a say.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:84%
She knew you were
going to have a say,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:90%
so she had to get to you.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right. [LAUGHS]

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So that's why when
parents name children,

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.135 align:middle line:90%
only two to three names come up.

00:10:29.135 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's true.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And the rest
sort of just blank out.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Or you might have the
beginning and the end,

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're waiting for
the middle one to turn up.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.405 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're a Michael.

00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, we know who you are.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul's
hoping, and usually 98%,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:84%
99% of the time, the
parents get it right.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.742 align:middle line:84%
And so their life will
happen the way they like.

00:10:47.742 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And the parents have the
illusion of free will.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.241 align:middle line:84%
They believe they've
chosen the name.

00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But actually the soul's
already worked it all out.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: That's the
way it actually works.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.433 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's an
interesting thing right there.

00:10:57.433 --> 00:11:05.945 align:middle line:84%
Because the argument of free
will versus purpose-- what

00:11:05.945 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:84%
is-- the opposite of
free will is-- my mind's

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.319 align:middle line:90%
totally going blank.

00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Following
the flow of spirit.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, the opposite,
where you feel you're locked in

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
already decided for you.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:90%
Anyway--

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Fate.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fate, yes.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Free will versus fate.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.140 align:middle line:84%
This is an argument that comes
up all the time between people.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:84%
When what you just said-- in my
estimation, that is how it is.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:90%
The soul has its free will.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And you-- it can
feel like fate to you

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
because you're the one
that has to live it out

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.870 align:middle line:84%
in the personality in
the third dimension.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.699 align:middle line:90%
Like, what's up with that?

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I wanted to do.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:90%
But there it is.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:90%
And you're destined to do it.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.737 align:middle line:84%
Because the soul
does have free will.

00:11:45.737 --> 00:11:47.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, the soul has
a particularly unique path

00:11:47.945 --> 00:11:49.030 align:middle line:90%
that it wishes to follow.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's doing its very
best to communicate to us.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And the more emotionally
clearer we become and present,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.225 align:middle line:84%
that allows the soul to
communicate through what

00:11:57.225 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:84%
we call the spiritual signature,
the flow in each moment.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.490 align:middle line:84%
There is actually
one right thing

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
to do in the flow of
spirit in each moment.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what opens
our heart, that gives us

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:84%
positive physical and
emotional sensations that

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:90%
come through us.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And if we flow with
that, life opens

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.667 align:middle line:84%
on what I call
the path of bliss.

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And so if we
surrender to that,

00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle line:84%
because the ego believes
it must have a final say.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it believes it's
more powerful than God,

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.650 align:middle line:84%
higher consciousness, where
it feels separate from it.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it's
the one which believes,

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I must have a say,
so I'm in charge.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm in control.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.926 align:middle line:84%
But if we get clear enough
and let that go and follow

00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual signature, the
flow of the heart, the path

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:84%
of bliss we're following,
the path of grace and ease,

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.414 align:middle line:90%
life opens and flows for us.

00:12:43.414 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually the
journey for all of us.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's a difficult
thing for a lot of people,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.420 align:middle line:90%
is to identify their light.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're doing
the work you're doing.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
You help them in
your book, which

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:84%
is very hands on, is giving
them the potential to see,

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:84%
in black and white,
right there, what

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.570 align:middle line:90%
it is their soul contract is.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:84%
What did their
soul come in to do?

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you align with
that higher purpose,

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and you embrace that truth,
and you have that clarity,

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I find it's very true.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Life takes on a completely
different aspect

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.740 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the
notion of struggle.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And you write in your
book, the biggest problem

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
is for a lot of people--
their mantra is, life is hard.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.553 align:middle line:84%
Or as they say in the US,
life's a bitch, then you die.

00:13:27.553 --> 00:13:28.052 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yup.

00:13:28.052 --> 00:13:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, it
will be if you don't

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:90%
follow the flow of spirit.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.575 align:middle line:84%
And you'll come back
and do it again.

00:13:31.575 --> 00:13:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] And again.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And again
until you surrender.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And so when they talk
about mastery and masters,

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.990 align:middle line:84%
the only true mastery
is the mastery

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.990 align:middle line:84%
of the ego, where it
is surrendered, where

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
we have mastery of
our consciousness

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:90%
and a flowing in each moment.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if we were to
flow in each right moment,

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:84%
everything that you
need will come to.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:84%
You've just got
to be open to it.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And the ego has to feel it
can let go and surrender.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.494 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually how you live
a graceful, fulfilling life.

00:14:05.494 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Because that's aligning with
the true purpose of the soul.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.109 align:middle line:84%
And that's never apparent
when we first arrive here.

00:14:10.109 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And once a person does align
with their soul's purpose,

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.050 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean
that there won't be

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:84%
issues that arise, such as,
oh, well that version of it

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:90%
has just gone away.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Now what am I supposed to do?

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.120 align:middle line:84%
But I think you're saying if you
are aligned with that purpose,

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:84%
even then you should
try to relax and stay

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:90%
in a state of grace.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the soul's busy
working it out to show you what

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
the next iteration
of that thing is.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.980 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be
a little patient,

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a little nail
biting for a little while.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Well, there is a plan.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.165 align:middle line:90%
God has a plan.

00:14:42.165 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And if God didn't have a
plan, we'd have a problem.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: OK.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.810 align:middle line:84%
But the ego feels that my little
ego here has to be in charge

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:90%
and work it all out.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.679 align:middle line:84%
It's looking behind
us thinking, don't

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
want any of this bad
stuff to happen again,

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.928 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to control it and
make sure it doesn't happen.

00:14:56.928 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the future is
not going to be that.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.127 align:middle line:84%
But that actually locks us down
out of a lot of possibilities.

00:15:02.127 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.543 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So actually
what we're wanting to do

00:15:04.543 --> 00:15:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is to surrender this,
gain mastery, which

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:84%
is letting it go,
dissolving it gradually,

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.630 align:middle line:84%
ego dissolution, which is what
all the leaders talk about,

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
is about letting go into
our true nature, which

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
is the vastness of spirit and
then allowing us to feel that

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.660 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul
contract work is all

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.469 align:middle line:84%
about identifying how
each of us uniquely builds

00:15:25.469 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
our ego structure, which
is what we need to have,

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:84%
because we inherently
feel separate,

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.714 align:middle line:84%
abandoned by God
by being in a body.

00:15:31.714 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Just the nature of
being born does that.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's part of
being human is unfortunately--

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
we're evolving out
of that, though.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.621 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:15:37.621 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the purpose
of it is to identify

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:84%
how we have decided to
be separate from higher

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.385 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
we've chosen that

00:15:47.385 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:84%
is because we each are
a spark of the divine.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.502 align:middle line:90%
We just forgot who we were.

00:15:51.502 --> 00:15:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of forgetting
is so that we will then

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.479 align:middle line:84%
seek to find the
true meaning of life.

00:15:55.479 --> 00:15:57.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest
question people have

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.615 align:middle line:84%
asked-- what's the
meaning of my life?

00:15:58.615 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: It's much more
than just making money

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:90%
or doing this or that.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:90%
It's actually--

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What am I here for?

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.071 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: --a deep question
we ask ourselves.

00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:05.805 align:middle line:84%
And it gets stronger
as we get older.

00:16:05.805 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we're each a
spark of the creator who

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:84%
has forgotten who we were,
deliberately, so we would

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:84%
engage with this
reality as if it's real.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.119 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a projection
of consciousness.

00:16:16.119 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And then through understanding
our soul contract, which

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:84%
is why I wrote the
book, I can see, ah,

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I've created a specific,
unique way of being

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:84%
separate from higher
consciousness.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So if I work through the
karmic issues, which are not

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
punishment, they're
just a negative context,

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.615 align:middle line:84%
which we're here to first
understand and engage

00:16:34.615 --> 00:16:36.632 align:middle line:90%
with and transmute.

00:16:36.632 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Life's a bitch because
most people do not

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:90%
engage with the hard stuff.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:41.869 align:middle line:90%
They turn away 90 degrees to it.

00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But if they engage
with, say disempowerment

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle line:84%
or victimization, they'll
discover within the shadow

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:84%
programs of that, the
gift of empowerment

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
by transmuting the many
layers of that karma.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And that actually
becomes the gift

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.510 align:middle line:84%
they're here to
deliver to the world.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:84%
That's partly the answer to
the question they're asking.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.822 align:middle line:90%
It's right in front of them.

00:16:58.822 --> 00:16:59.786 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And so
when they do that,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:84%
they actually start to
align with their purpose.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And then when they start to
align with their purpose,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.520 align:middle line:90%
life starts to flow and open.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.849 align:middle line:90%
And opportunities open.

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:10.974 align:middle line:84%
And unsolvable situations
start to resolve themselves

00:17:10.974 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
because they're viewing their
life from a state of higher

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:84%
They see I'm a spirit
having a human experience.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And if I stand back and say,
ah, my ego is doing this,

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.115 align:middle line:84%
therefore I see what
I'm trying to learn,

00:17:22.115 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:84%
so I'll go take
the right action.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.948 align:middle line:84%
I won't do what my
ego wants to do,

00:17:24.948 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:84%
which is avoid the suffering
and feeling associated with it.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I'll engage with it
and transform it.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And therefore life does
flow, life does open.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep
doing that, you will

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:40.190 align:middle line:84%
achieve the place of what we
call soul integration, where

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:84%
the soul has much
more fully embodied

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:90%
and the ego has dissolved.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.204 align:middle line:84%
And the feelings and
thoughts, or the personality

00:17:47.204 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and the soul, are one
in the same thing.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we're on
the path of bliss,

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.850 align:middle line:84%
the path of alignment
with the soul.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of this work
is to get people on that path

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.770 align:middle line:84%
so they can deliver their gifts
and live a happier life, a more

00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:90%
fulfilling life.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk about purpose,
in the West oftentimes--

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:90%
what is my purpose?

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And there becomes
this kind of confusion

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that purpose has to do
with work and that work

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
has to do with money
and sources of income.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the whole
thing gets muddied up.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Because your life's purpose
does not necessarily

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.564 align:middle line:84%
have to do anything with
what you do in your work

00:18:25.564 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:84%
or for a living or how you
spend the majority of your time

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:84%
doing that just to take
care of the necessities

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:90%
of physical life.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And when people often-- when
I watch people, where they're

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
starting to connect with
what they want to do,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I've watched people
walk right away from it

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.140 align:middle line:90%
and suffer even more.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they couldn't find a
way to make a living at it.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Can you address that part of it?

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: If we are truly
engaged with our real purpose,

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:90%
the universe will provide.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.162 align:middle line:84%
But it's the fear the
ego has of only living.

00:18:56.162 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it has this very
narrow set of consciousness.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.828 align:middle line:84%
Money has to come
in a certain way.

00:18:59.828 --> 00:19:00.732 align:middle line:90%
It could be a job.

00:19:00.732 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: OK.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.494 align:middle line:84%
And so their purpose may be
to do this spiritually, which

00:19:04.494 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:84%
means no job in a
conventional sense,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.465 align:middle line:84%
but time and space to do
whatever it is they're

00:19:09.465 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:90%
here to do.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So if they align with that
flow, and depending what's

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.790 align:middle line:84%
in their soul contract,
the money will turn up.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:90%
It will actually flow.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.972 align:middle line:84%
Like me coming here
to America for this.

00:19:19.972 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Initially I thought, I don't
know how I'm going to do this.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.885 align:middle line:84%
But actually things
started to turn up.

00:19:24.885 --> 00:19:26.482 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, OK,
there is a plan.

00:19:26.482 --> 00:19:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I always know
there's a plan, but I

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:90%
start to feel there was a plan.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:90%
And so I just let it unfold.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.637 align:middle line:90%
And here we are.

00:19:32.637 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: About maybe 12
months since we first

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:90%
talked about this.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: It's actually happening.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:38.763 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: It's viable.

00:19:38.763 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't the way
I thought it would be.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.562 align:middle line:90%
But I let go what that will be.

00:19:43.562 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just happened because
I followed the flow.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
a woman I know.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.680 align:middle line:90%
She loves nurturing.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:90%
She's a European women.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
She's an aesthetician,
loves working with skin

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and botanicals.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:90%
And she just loves this.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:02.757 align:middle line:84%
And she was finding
that it's difficult.

00:20:02.757 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:84%
It was difficult for her
to get going in all that.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And it just popped into
my mind out of nowhere,

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.675 align:middle line:90%
so I'm bringing it up.

00:20:07.675 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Out of the blue, she
receives this inheritance

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.610 align:middle line:84%
from a person who was an old
man in another country she

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:16.944 align:middle line:90%
had stayed in for a short time.

00:20:16.944 --> 00:20:17.860 align:middle line:90%
And he was a neighbor.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:90%
And he was elderly.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
She would bring him
food and chat with him

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:90%
and just be nice to him.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:90%
He had no family left.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And he left his home to her,
totally out of the blue,

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:90%
unexpectedly.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
This inheritance
came that allowed

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.399 align:middle line:84%
her to continue doing
what she loved doing.

00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:36.815 align:middle line:84%
In a conscious
sense, she couldn't

00:20:36.815 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:84%
think how that was
going to happen.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
The point is, these kinds
of little miracles--

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:90%
they seem like miracles.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
The soul is capable
of great miracles.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And these things are
happening all the time

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:84%
if we don't try to
use the ego to control

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.615 align:middle line:84%
and say, no, I've
got to have this job.

00:20:51.615 --> 00:20:55.239 align:middle line:84%
And I have to have
a, you know, an IRS--

00:20:55.239 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:84%
an IRA-- Is that
what they're called?

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:90%
401(k).

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And I have to have
this amount of money

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:84%
saved by this time, which is
the greatest destroyer, it seems

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.595 align:middle line:84%
to me, of dreams, oftentimes,
of connecting with soul purpose.

00:21:08.595 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: It's very important
when you get connected to it,

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:84%
is just to go with
the passion of it.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.429 align:middle line:90%
And let it provide.

00:21:14.429 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And if we
go with the passion

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and deliver that
unconditionally,

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
if we purely learn what our real
purpose is, it will turn up.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.694 align:middle line:90%
It has to.

00:21:23.694 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we're just
sparks of the creator

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:90%
creating, or co-creating.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So how can it not turn
up if we're the creator?

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.080 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's
in the way is our belief

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.030 align:middle line:90%
that it's not going to come.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:32.613 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:32.613 --> 00:21:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Our fear
of it not coming

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.855 align:middle line:90%
is actually the main obstacle.

00:21:35.855 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So then we feel we have to
control and structure things

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:90%
to make up for that.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:90%
So I understand that.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to put that
out because I witness it

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.740 align:middle line:84%
all the time, great,
great miracles.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:90%
They're not miracles.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.310 align:middle line:84%
The soul is able to perform
on our behalf in the most

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:90%
interesting ways.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: That's how
it's meant to be.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's how
it's meant to be.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: But people
have forgotten.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.778 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:21:54.778 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:90%
But Yes.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:90%
People have forgotten.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about--
when your soul

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.132 align:middle line:84%
is attempting to play this
out through the 3D world,

00:22:02.132 --> 00:22:04.340 align:middle line:84%
we just talked about what
some of the roadblocks are.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about what
some of the tools are.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
The soul chooses the
place we're going

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:84%
to be born, the time we're
going to be born, the name we're

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:90%
going to be born under, ideally.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.665 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes maybe the
soul doesn't always

00:22:16.665 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:90%
get through to the parents.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Occasionally,
maybe 1% or 2% of the time.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.738 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time
they get it right.

00:22:21.738 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And our astrology, the stars
we're going to be born under.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So these are all
imprints and tools

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.790 align:middle line:84%
that affect-- pick up
the sentence from there.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah, the soul designs
the whole lifetime in entirety.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
It's got a basic plan of
what it's going to do,

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
what it wishes to
achieve, and then it

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.832 align:middle line:90%
programs that into the name.

00:22:42.832 --> 00:22:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And that name is
programmed into us

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:84%
in a substance
called karmic matrix.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.445 align:middle line:84%
It's like a gray,
cobweb substance

00:22:48.445 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:84%
that sits on a fourth,
fifth, and sixth

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:90%
dimensional levels in us.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And it is literally
the programming

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:90%
of the Law of Attraction.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And this stuff radiates out
to the reality in each moment.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is
rearranging around that.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why two different
people in the same room

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:90%
have a different reality.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is actually
triggering this karmic matrix.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.042 align:middle line:84%
And certain things
happen in life,

00:23:10.042 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:84%
like the same sort of
boyfriends turn up for a while,

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
or girlfriends turn
up for a while,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.775 align:middle line:84%
until you learn
the lesson, which

00:23:14.775 --> 00:23:16.447 align:middle line:84%
could be, I need
to say no to this.

00:23:16.447 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: OK.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Then it goes away.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:90%
The soul says, OK.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:90%
We'll try something else.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do this.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Then something else
starts for a while.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So the soul's triggering
this karmic matrix

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and seeing, well, what's
going to happen now?

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.482 align:middle line:90%
Will she work it out?

00:23:27.482 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Or will he work it out?

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Because it wants
us, at a personality

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.331 align:middle line:84%
level-- because our
personalities are

00:23:32.331 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
brand new each lifetime-- to
have the visceral experience

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:84%
of going from what I
call the negative context

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:84%
of the karmic pattern--
could be feeling very shy.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.470 align:middle line:90%
I was very shy as a child.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.397 align:middle line:84%
And to go from being
very shy, and working

00:23:47.397 --> 00:23:48.980 align:middle line:84%
through all the
issues of unworthiness

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.563 align:middle line:84%
or whatever issues
are there, to being

00:23:50.563 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:84%
able to communicate
better, to speak, to teach.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul wants
go to and experience

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.025 align:middle line:84%
what it is like for
itself as a spark of God

00:23:59.025 --> 00:24:00.650 align:middle line:84%
to go through the
experience of living,

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.170 align:middle line:84%
being worthy to really
express its truth.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And it goes from one
polarity to another

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.452 align:middle line:84%
and in 22 different polarities
we work with in the system.

00:24:08.452 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Because there are 22 numbers.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So the variety you can
have down here is infinite.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I've never seem
two charts the same

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:90%
when we work with this system.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens
when a being decides

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
to come into a body that is
challenged or damaged and has

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.295 align:middle line:90%
what we call birth defects?

00:24:25.295 --> 00:24:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well the soul's
programmed that in as well,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:90%
genetically.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Because it's basically in charge
of the genes from the time

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:84%
it incarnates, which is
why most of the time kids

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.011 align:middle line:90%
come out imperfect.

00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:37.872 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:24:37.872 --> 00:24:39.330 align:middle line:84%
There's 100 trillion
souls, I wrote

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:84%
in the book, that come
out all in one piece.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And you sort of think,
that has to be a miracle.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.874 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:24:44.874 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And so it may actually
trigger some genetic defects

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.210 align:middle line:84%
to create a challenge
in some ways,

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
either for itself and
probably the parents as well.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
It may want to have
a limited experience

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.260 align:middle line:90%
to see what that's like.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is often programmed
into the contract.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.795 align:middle line:84%
There is one particular
number called

00:25:03.795 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:84%
a 21, which is about
building great endurance

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:90%
through overcoming hardship.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And you may see something
with that occasionally.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.085 align:middle line:84%
But it just depends on
the particular experience

00:25:16.085 --> 00:25:17.120 align:middle line:90%
a soul wants to have.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Because , from a human
perspective, we feel, man,

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.682 align:middle line:90%
that's really tough.

00:25:20.682 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But from the soul's
perspective, it

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
needs that intensity to actually
grow, because it grows faster

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.639 align:middle line:84%
by being in a physical
body than when

00:25:27.639 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:90%
we're on the higher dimensions.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would assume
that, by same token,

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
healing is also programmed
into that matrix

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.120 align:middle line:84%
of our name and those
sounds and numbers.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yes.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.267 align:middle line:84%
If we understand it,
the exact frequency

00:25:44.267 --> 00:25:45.850 align:middle line:84%
is that program
that's running, that's

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:90%
creating a particular situation.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.587 align:middle line:84%
If we infuse the
opposite frequency

00:25:49.587 --> 00:25:51.045 align:middle line:84%
or the appropriate
frequency, which

00:25:51.045 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
will counteract that, then
we can start to, much more

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.186 align:middle line:90%
quickly, dissolve the program.

00:25:56.186 --> 00:25:57.685 align:middle line:84%
And because we
brought consciousness

00:25:57.685 --> 00:26:00.810 align:middle line:84%
to the program, which is the
last thing our ego wants,

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:90%
therefore we're halfway home.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Because it's been
rumbled basically.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:84%
If we can feel our programming,
100% in that moment,

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.120 align:middle line:90%
it would just dissolve.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Because all it wants
is to be acknowledged.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And then it will
change and transform.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But we have lots of lovely
healing modalities on earth.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.447 align:middle line:84%
We usually think
of divine healing,

00:26:20.447 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:84%
which Ahlmeirah, who
developed this with me,

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
developed with a couple of other
healers, which uses the higher

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
self, which created all the ego
structure in the first place,

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
to actually dismantle
it at the same time.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is to have
a conscious, feeling experience

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:84%
of going from some
serious issue, physically

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:84%
or emotionally or both, to
actually the dissolution of it

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and the reconstruction
back to wholeness.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.962 align:middle line:84%
It's actually that journey
into wholeness, which is what--

00:26:43.962 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
wholeness and heart.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.546 align:middle line:90%
It has to go through heart.

00:26:46.546 --> 00:26:47.711 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: The soul wants that.

00:26:47.711 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the purpose
of life, actually.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:50.644 align:middle line:84%
It's not some
endpoint-- I've got

00:26:50.644 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:84%
to have a 401(k) and second
house and that sort of stuff.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.140 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the journey
that the soul wants to have,

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:84%
which is what we
need to align with.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.238 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about what

00:26:59.238 --> 00:27:02.280 align:middle line:90%
the soul could care less about.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: It's not too worried
about the material stuff

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.390 align:middle line:84%
particularly, although that
may be in the contract,

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:08.275 align:middle line:84%
to have material worth,
probably to work out actually

00:27:08.275 --> 00:27:09.645 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter in the end.

00:27:09.645 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
take it with you.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: You can only take your
consciousness and your memory

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.440 align:middle line:84%
with you when you
leave this earth plane.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So you might as
well make them good ones

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.780 align:middle line:90%
if you're going to do that.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's having the most
conscious life experience

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
to return back to love-- that's
actually why the soul's here

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
in many different ways-- and
about letting go of the past,

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.030 align:middle line:84%
being in the moment,
flowing in the moment.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Because when the soul's in the
heart in each moment, when it's

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:90%
in body, it's learning the most.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Because then it can
deliver its gift.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:84%
When the personality surrenders
enough to allow it to do that,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.640 align:middle line:90%
that's its greatest joy.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.380 align:middle line:84%
It's about to serve and deliver
in whatever form that is.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And it can control--
when I say control,

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean by term of just even
choosing to listen and flow.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:84%
It can manage how that's
going to manifest in life.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:84%
But we're also surrounded
with other people.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.975 align:middle line:84%
We make our soul
contracts before we're

00:28:05.975 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:90%
born with our parents.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you see instances
where the parents simply

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:15.010 align:middle line:84%
do not live out the contract
they agreed to with the child?

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.552 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, it's
more about-- often

00:28:16.552 --> 00:28:18.593 align:middle line:84%
people don't get very far
through their contract.

00:28:18.593 --> 00:28:20.120 align:middle line:84%
You can look at
someone's contract.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And you realize
all that's stuck in

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.787 align:middle line:90%
the physical karmic challenges.

00:28:24.787 --> 00:28:25.870 align:middle line:90%
They haven't got very far.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And how the spiritual
part of the chart

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.250 align:middle line:84%
never happened because they
were stuck at the beginning.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's more the issue.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.585 align:middle line:84%
So the soul contract
is like a broad map.

00:28:35.585 --> 00:28:37.719 align:middle line:84%
It's a holographic
map of potential.

00:28:37.719 --> 00:28:39.385 align:middle line:84%
And what you're trying
to see is how far

00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:84%
has someone actualized
that potential?

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And in each of the--
we have three aspects

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.500 align:middle line:84%
in the physical part and three
aspects in the spiritual.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.900 align:middle line:84%
We have what we call
karma, or challenges,

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.387 align:middle line:84%
talents to overcome them,
and then goals to achieve,

00:28:55.387 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:90%
both physically and spiritually.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.344 align:middle line:84%
So we've got six aspects, then,
and we blend them all together.

00:28:59.344 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:84%
If you work all of
them through-- which

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.685 align:middle line:84%
is rare, but can be done-- you
manifest your soul purpose,

00:29:04.685 --> 00:29:06.780 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of life.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
You manifest the point
of soul integration.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So people get stuck
in different places.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Some parts of their chart may
be really worked through well.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Other parts may be,
oh, that's a tough one.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.710 align:middle line:90%
I got stuck on that.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:90%
So it holds them back.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends where
people are on their chart.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Because the soul doesn't know.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:84%
It sort of like sets
this whole experiment

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.840 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness in motion--

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
a blindfold on

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.295 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to play this out.

00:29:29.295 --> 00:29:31.035 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: --and then you say,
OK, what's going to happen now?

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Exactly.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the likelihood of one
or more parties not making

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:38.250 align:middle line:84%
it all the way through the
contract is quite high.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: It's quite high.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.954 align:middle line:84%
And the dynamics may not--
they may play out generally

00:29:41.954 --> 00:29:43.870 align:middle line:84%
how it was planned, but
no one actually knows.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.915 align:middle line:84%
Because if they did know,
they wouldn't do it.

00:29:46.915 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A moment ago
you were talking about

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:84%
as we're creating
this reality-- you

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.268 align:middle line:84%
were talking about
the Law of Attraction.

00:29:52.268 --> 00:29:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But you also talk about
the Law of Opposites.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:10%
Neil Donald Walsch wrote in
his book Happier Than God.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.270 align:middle line:10%
He talks about that there.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.945 align:middle line:10%
And basically what happens is
that by the Law of Attraction,

00:30:07.945 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:10%
you initially get
everything you don't want.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.590 align:middle line:10%
So you get very clear from
that, I don't like my parents,

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.787 align:middle line:10%
or this or that.

00:30:14.787 --> 00:30:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Therefore I want this
on the other polarity.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So you get really
clear what you do want,

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.569 align:middle line:84%
which is why the Law
of Opposites cuts in.

00:30:20.569 --> 00:30:22.235 align:middle line:84%
And many people feel
because they're not

00:30:22.235 --> 00:30:23.735 align:middle line:84%
getting what they
don't want, that's

00:30:23.735 --> 00:30:25.986 align:middle line:84%
actually going to
be the whole life.

00:30:25.986 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And so with the
soul contract, we

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.600 align:middle line:90%
can see what they're going to--

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's almost like
a mirrored reflection.

00:30:29.795 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: It is.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.252 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
can kind of keep

00:30:32.252 --> 00:30:33.960 align:middle line:84%
finding your way
through the maze of what

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.880 align:middle line:84%
doesn't work until you
find what you do work,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:90%
is what you're saying, right?

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: It's process
of elimination.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't realize it's
the process of elimination,

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.730 align:middle line:84%
don't get very
further than that.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is showing you
a lot of what you don't want.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.029 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to go
for what you do want.

00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And that will happen.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.086 align:middle line:84%
And as that happens, what you
don't want starts to disappear.

00:30:51.086 --> 00:30:53.585 align:middle line:84%
But then other things start to
turn up, what you don't want,

00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:55.334 align:middle line:84%
until you eventually
get to what you want.

00:30:55.334 --> 00:30:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So basically you sort
of get moved around.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:02.079 align:middle line:84%
But when you realize it's
only an illusion, and actually

00:31:02.079 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:84%
when you seriously get
what you don't want,

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.214 align:middle line:84%
you're usually closer
to what you do want.

00:31:06.214 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's a
good thing for all of us

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.880 align:middle line:90%
to remember.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.670 align:middle line:84%
When it's just feeling
the most frustrating,

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:11.584 align:middle line:90%
you're almost there.

00:31:11.584 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah,
because what happens

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.422 align:middle line:84%
is that we tend to focus on
everything that's not working.

00:31:15.422 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
That's creating
what we don't want.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But if we shift
and pull our energy

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.610 align:middle line:84%
away from that, our
creative energy,

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
because we're creating from
the higher consciousness,

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:26.350 align:middle line:84%
embodying, then we
get what we do want.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like the
saying, the darkest hour

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.640 align:middle line:90%
is just before dawn.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Well it is.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I gave an example in the book
of I was trying to buy a car.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
clear what I wanted.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And I saw one which looked
good on the internet.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.720 align:middle line:90%
But it was totally trashed.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.110 align:middle line:84%
When I actually saw
it, I thought, aw, I'm

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.830 align:middle line:90%
miles away from it.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.996 align:middle line:84%
Then I remembered this very
thing, Law of Opposites.

00:31:46.996 --> 00:31:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So I pulled out of that despair
and focused on what I did want.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And that night, the one I
wanted was on the internet, just

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.450 align:middle line:90%
got posted.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And I turned up the next
morning, it was perfect.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Within six, seven hours of
seeing what I didn't want,

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:90%
I had what I wanted.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.650 align:middle line:90%
And I bought it.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:04.920 align:middle line:90%
And I've still got it.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.336 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why did you need
to go through that process?

00:32:07.336 --> 00:32:08.850 align:middle line:90%
You knew what you wanted.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: It's because it's
just the way the matrix works.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The matrix works.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: You always get
what you don't want.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like trying to
find a partner in life.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.870 align:middle line:84%
People go through lots
of different partners

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.411 align:middle line:84%
and then progressively
hopefully they

00:32:18.411 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:90%
find more of what they like.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And they get very clear
on what we they do want.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.282 align:middle line:84%
And the right one, if
you're lucky, turns up.

00:32:23.282 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Very true.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a
quick look at an image that

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.140 align:middle line:90%
is the star map.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So people can see the
star you're talking about,

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:33.940 align:middle line:90%
a potential.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's see that
up on the screen.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you can explain to us
what that star map looks like.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the Star of David.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And at the top, it says,
spiritual goals-- kind

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.760 align:middle line:84%
of counter clockwise-- physical
goals, spiritual talents,

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.050 align:middle line:84%
physical talents, spiritual
karma, physical karma, and then

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:50.730 align:middle line:90%
soul destiny.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So explain why the Star of
David and how this works.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: OK.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So the large,
downward-pointing triangle

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:84%
represents the
physical side of life.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we as
conscious beings, we

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.680 align:middle line:84%
create a brand new personality
expression each lifetime.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Our soul's eternal,
which has many lifetimes.

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.150 align:middle line:90%
But we're brand new.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So we need to learn
to walk and talk,

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:16.120 align:middle line:84%
get conditioned responses,
education, careers, partners,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.710 align:middle line:90%
just get up and running in life.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So we spend the first
five cycles of seven years

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.484 align:middle line:84%
in the lower triangle,
or predominantly

00:33:22.484 --> 00:33:23.400 align:middle line:90%
in the lower triangle.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.690 align:middle line:90%
All the aspects run at once.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
between the ages of 35 and 42,

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.890 align:middle line:84%
or earlier, we start to
get the mid-life crisis,

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.570 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual crisis, dark
night of the soul, whatever

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.661 align:middle line:90%
you want to call it.

00:33:36.661 --> 00:33:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And the large, upward-pointing
triangle becomes predominant.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.617 align:middle line:90%
It's a spiritual triangle.

00:33:40.617 --> 00:33:42.783 align:middle line:84%
That's where we feel, there's
got to be more to life

00:33:42.783 --> 00:33:43.909 align:middle line:90%
than this.

00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're really
searching for the answers.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So we get divorced, change
jobs, get married, get divorced,

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.630 align:middle line:90%
maybe have children.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.670 align:middle line:84%
We get really serious
about life because we're

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:90%
trying to find the real purpose.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul's trying to
build this spiritual triangle

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
on the foundation of
the physical triangle.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And within each
of these triangles

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.405 align:middle line:84%
are three aspects, these
karma, talents and goals.

00:34:07.405 --> 00:34:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And karma is the set
of unresolved past life

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.139 align:middle line:84%
issues it brings in
for this lifetime

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.219 align:middle line:84%
to create the negative
context, or the Law

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:16.719 align:middle line:90%
of Opposites for a while.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:90%
So we get clear what we do want.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And then we have talents, which
are here to overcome the karma.

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:25.449 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking
on the triangle,

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.737 align:middle line:84%
we see there's physical
karma on the top right.

00:34:28.737 --> 00:34:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So the physical
talents at the bottom,

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.694 align:middle line:84%
if they're
well-matched, activate

00:34:31.694 --> 00:34:34.100 align:middle line:84%
from the time we're born to
overcome the physical karma.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.720 align:middle line:84%
If it's a good match in terms
of consciousness and power

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.570 align:middle line:90%
and quality of energy.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And as we overcome the
karma, it becomes our gift

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.210 align:middle line:90%
to deliver to the world.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Talents get stronger.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.839 align:middle line:84%
We move to the top left,
which is the physical goals.

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:48.179 align:middle line:84%
It's like the underlying
drive we have in life.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:51.138 align:middle line:84%
What gets us out of bed in
the morning, what excites us.

00:34:51.138 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:84%
So the energy flows
from the physical karma

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:90%
to talents to goals.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.992 align:middle line:84%
And the physical outerworld
is like our interface.

00:34:56.992 --> 00:34:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the same with
the spiritual upper-pointing

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:00.420 align:middle line:90%
triangle.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:84%
We have spiritual karma,
talents, and goals.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
the spiritual karma

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.170 align:middle line:84%
is our gateway to deliver
our spiritual gift,

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:84%
to help us, if we work
through it, to embody

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the specific type of
higher consciousness energy

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:84%
to come to us, through us,
and out into the world,

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.090 align:middle line:84%
through our physical
triangle, to deliver our gift.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually what
we're searching for.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we blend
all six together,

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:84%
if we work them all through,
we get the soul destiny,

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.847 align:middle line:84%
manifesting progressively
through life, which is actually

00:35:28.847 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
the real purpose for
being here, which

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.520 align:middle line:90%
is what we're all searching for.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.406 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the
reason we're alive.

00:35:34.406 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if we'd achieved it,
we wouldn't be here anymore.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.030 align:middle line:84%
The soul's always trying
to bring that forth

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.556 align:middle line:90%
in all sorts of different ways.

00:35:40.556 --> 00:35:42.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's the essence
of how the chart works.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:46.091 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when someone--
you can do this for yourself,

00:35:46.091 --> 00:35:47.090 align:middle line:90%
by the way, in the book.

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:48.570 align:middle line:90%
I just want to let people know.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.270 align:middle line:84%
All the tools are there
to do your own soul chart.

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:53.090 align:middle line:84%
But, say if you're
doing this for someone,

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.869 align:middle line:90%
and they come before you.

00:35:54.869 --> 00:35:55.660 align:middle line:90%
What's the process?

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.900 align:middle line:84%
They just give you their
full birth name initially?

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:59.870 align:middle line:84%
We start with the full
birth certificate name.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:00.600 align:middle line:90%
It's all we need.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.807 align:middle line:84%
We need date of birth just
for their age and star sign.

00:36:02.807 --> 00:36:03.867 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
where people start.

00:36:03.867 --> 00:36:04.367 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:04.367 --> 00:36:07.379 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: But basically we convert
that into the equivalent Hebrew

00:36:07.379 --> 00:36:09.545 align:middle line:84%
sounds and numbers, which
are one in the same thing.

00:36:09.545 --> 00:36:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And we allocate
them around the star

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.400 align:middle line:90%
until we run out of numbers.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.250 align:middle line:84%
We do a bit of math
on the numbers,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.800 align:middle line:84%
then for each of the
six outer aspects,

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:84%
we get a set of numbers,
a pair of numbers,

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.790 align:middle line:84%
everything from a 22 and
a 4-- because 2 plus 2

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:90%
is 4-- we get like a 14 and a 5.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.280 align:middle line:90%
We get a 9 and another 9.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Because it's got a double
number, all the way to a 1

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:90%
and a 1.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And so each of them has
a very specific meaning

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.080 align:middle line:84%
in the system, based
on the channelings

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.470 align:middle line:84%
from the soul of Moses
through Frank Harper.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:10%
And each aspect, so
people can basically

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.210 align:middle line:10%
look at where their
numbers are in the book

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:10%
and work our the spiritual
map of their life.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:49.810 align:middle line:10%
It's all in there.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.980 align:middle line:10%
And they can, once they've
figured out their chat,

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.230 align:middle line:10%
which they can do manually
or with the software, which

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.530 align:middle line:10%
goes with the website
for the book-- that's

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:59.757 align:middle line:10%
yoursoulcontractdecoded.com--
what they can actually then do

00:36:59.757 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:10%
is look in the book to
see, OK, how far have

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.972 align:middle line:10%
I got through all
my six aspects?

00:37:02.972 --> 00:37:03.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:37:03.513 --> 00:37:04.012 align:middle line:90%
That's big.

00:37:04.012 --> 00:37:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.993 align:middle line:84%
It's like a progressive
chart in astrology almost.

00:37:07.993 --> 00:37:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.100 align:middle line:84%
But they've got to work out,
OK I can see I'm about 20%

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.860 align:middle line:84%
of the way through this one,
30-- ooh, this is a tough one.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.222 align:middle line:90%
I've only got about 10% through.

00:37:15.222 --> 00:37:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I've got a bit of
work to do there.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So they can
work out where they are.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And then most
importantly, the book

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:22.150 align:middle line:84%
provides recommendations
based on working

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.240 align:middle line:90%
with thousands of clients.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.241 align:middle line:90%
What do you do about it?

00:37:24.241 --> 00:37:24.906 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:24.906 --> 00:37:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Everyone wants
to know, what do I do now

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:84%
from wherever I am in my
life, because I feel stuck.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Or I feel I'm not
clear on purpose

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.200 align:middle line:84%
or there's something
specific which

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.980 align:middle line:84%
has brought them to
seek this work out.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So then they can look
at the recommendations

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:90%
and choose from those.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I can handle this one
and this one and this one.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.025 align:middle line:90%
Ah, there's a way forward.

00:37:43.025 --> 00:37:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So when they start to
apply the recommendations,

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.860 align:middle line:84%
you start to dismantle
the programming.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.255 align:middle line:84%
You start to burn through
the emotional separation

00:37:51.255 --> 00:37:51.755 align:middle line:90%
programming.

00:37:51.755 --> 00:37:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
all happening, well,

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.680 align:middle line:84%
mostly happening,
on a subconscious

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.540 align:middle line:90%
level or a conscious level?

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Once you-- say if I you
were to fiddle with it

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, I'm going to
change the spelling of my name,

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.397 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:38:02.397 --> 00:38:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Once you read the
book and realize what's really

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:07.725 align:middle line:84%
going on, this is
the big secret,

00:38:07.725 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:84%
that someone's hidden my entire
life from me, and here it is.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:12.289 align:middle line:90%
This is what this work does.

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I've got my map in front of me.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.384 align:middle line:84%
I'm conscious of
what's going on.

00:38:15.384 --> 00:38:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Then you can do
something about it

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.450 align:middle line:84%
so it can't sabotage
you subconsciously,

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.190 align:middle line:84%
which is what most
people do in life.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Stuff just happens.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:84%
We wonder, well, where
did that come from?

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.344 align:middle line:90%
And it came from here.

00:38:25.344 --> 00:38:26.510 align:middle line:90%
But it will be in the chart.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:28.843 align:middle line:84%
So then they can see, oh, I
need to work on this program

00:38:28.843 --> 00:38:29.940 align:middle line:90%
to break through that.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.440 align:middle line:84%
So they can drop
80% of their effort

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.920 align:middle line:84%
on things which aren't
going to work, which

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.819 align:middle line:84%
becomes apparent in the book,
to get on with what does work.

00:38:36.819 --> 00:38:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So before we get to the
question I was going to ask you,

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.212 align:middle line:90%
there are certain numbers.

00:38:42.212 --> 00:38:43.170 align:middle line:90%
I've written them down.

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:44.794 align:middle line:84%
You said there are
certain numbers that

00:38:44.794 --> 00:38:48.970 align:middle line:84%
have a really big impact on us
when they show up on our chart.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.812 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you can
just give us an idea

00:38:50.812 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:84%
of what some of
these numbers mean.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not the same
as classical numerology.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:59.200 align:middle line:84%
The assignation of
values is different.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about, for
a moment, the number 3,

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.890 align:middle line:84%
for example, when that
shows up in a chart.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: The 3 is
all about becoming

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.970 align:middle line:84%
worthy to express the
deepest wisdom of the soul,

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:13.076 align:middle line:90%
as a teacher and a communicator.

00:39:13.076 --> 00:39:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I have a physical
karmic 3, which

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:15.950 align:middle line:84%
is communicating
to you and everyone

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:18.240 align:middle line:84%
here, having worked through
a lot of unworthiness

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to actually bring
this knowledge out

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to the world, which
is why I write books.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it's about
bringing out, deep

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.940 align:middle line:84%
within that, a vast
library of knowledge,

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.440 align:middle line:84%
which has been installed and
just waiting for the right time

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.660 align:middle line:90%
to become visible to the world.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So the 13 is all about the
divine feminine aspect of God.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's about coming
into that place

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:84%
of total unconditional
love for yourself

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.281 align:middle line:84%
and for others, just that
acceptance of all things.

00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:49.530 align:middle line:90%
That's a very powerful number.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.410 align:middle line:84%
That's a number of the
current age we're in.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.440 align:middle line:84%
We're moving from
the predominance

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.940 align:middle line:84%
of the unconscious masculine to
the consciousness of the divine

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:84%
feminine, unity consciousness
accepts all things

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.140 align:middle line:90%
as part of the one.

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about the number 4?

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I have about six of
these written down.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And the 4 is all about
the flow of God's abundance.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.725 align:middle line:84%
It's all about taking the energy
of knowledge, ideas, money,

00:40:14.725 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and flow.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm being worthy to
unconditionally accept it

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.900 align:middle line:84%
in your life and then
duplicating it and sharing it

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.350 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the same
way that came to you.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I have a 4, which is maintain
the essence of what Frank told

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:30.180 align:middle line:84%
me, the core essence, very
esoteric transmission,

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.060 align:middle line:84%
but also expanded it
by trying to make it

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.296 align:middle line:84%
more accessible, but without
losing the essence of it.

00:40:36.296 --> 00:40:37.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's what a 4 is.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:40.365 align:middle line:84%
4s are the teachers,
sharers of knowledge,

00:40:40.365 --> 00:40:41.990 align:middle line:84%
creators of abundance,
philanthropists.

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.850 align:middle line:90%
They just need to share.

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:43.780 align:middle line:90%
They hear the good stuff.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.310 align:middle line:84%
They want to tell
everyone about it.

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:45.893 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:45.893 --> 00:40:47.110 align:middle line:90%
I must have some 4 in there.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.693 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: I think you
got some in there.

00:40:48.693 --> 00:40:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]
What about 7s?

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: 7s are
about-- that's what

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.150 align:middle line:84%
we call a link which unites--
there's two parts of a seven.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:59.470 align:middle line:84%
The 7 suffers a heart wound from
one or other or both parents

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:90%
as a child.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So the inner child
goes into hiding.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's fearful
of being seen again

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:08.255 align:middle line:84%
because it's scared it
will be seen as dark or bad

00:41:08.255 --> 00:41:08.950 align:middle line:90%
or be rejected.

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:10.050 align:middle line:90%
So it hides.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And it puts out a
facade out to the world.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.479 align:middle line:84%
So there's an indecision
of someone with a 7.

00:41:15.479 --> 00:41:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't feel safe to
share of themselves-- so shall

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:18.894 align:middle line:90%
I share my real self?

00:41:18.894 --> 00:41:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Or shall I hide?

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:23.627 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll be indecisive on
all other areas of their life.

00:41:23.627 --> 00:41:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And they won't know
what's real in the world

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.001 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
know who they are.

00:41:27.001 --> 00:41:28.750 align:middle line:84%
They haven't decided
who they are.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.265 align:middle line:84%
So their job is
to drop the facade

00:41:30.265 --> 00:41:33.722 align:middle line:84%
and learn it's safe to bring
their true self, true feelings

00:41:33.722 --> 00:41:36.013 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts, out to the
world and realize when they're

00:41:36.013 --> 00:41:38.620 align:middle line:84%
in that higher consciousness
bubble of truth, which

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.420 align:middle line:84%
resonates at a very
high level, even higher

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:43.300 align:middle line:84%
than unconditional love,
everyone around them has

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to open their hearts,
has to be in their truth.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.754 align:middle line:84%
Like someone walks in the
room and tells the truth,

00:41:47.754 --> 00:41:48.590 align:middle line:90%
everyone goes quiet.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Someone tells a
lie, everyone knows

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.415 align:middle line:84%
it's a lie because
their frequency just

00:41:51.415 --> 00:41:52.425 align:middle line:90%
drops through the floor.

00:41:52.425 --> 00:41:54.453 align:middle line:90%
So 7s are to be the former.

00:41:54.453 --> 00:41:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
7s take courage.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: They're to take
courage to be true.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.656 align:middle line:84%
And then as they
heal their heart,

00:41:59.656 --> 00:42:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the magnetics of the soul
draw everyone and everything

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.300 align:middle line:90%
they need in their life to them.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about the number 8?

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: 8 is-- has a
symbol of like an amoeba,

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:12.770 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually
a watery creature.

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's about learning
to ground here on earth,

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.320 align:middle line:84%
form clear emotional
boundaries, and learn

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.480 align:middle line:84%
how to polarize intense
emotions of earth work.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And 8s usually are
going to be very heady.

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:24.830 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
think about emotions.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.090 align:middle line:84%
You know how men often
say, I think I feel.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, they literally mean that,
because they're actually--

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.850 align:middle line:90%
an 8 really means that.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.869 align:middle line:84%
Because they're thinking
about what's going on.

00:42:32.869 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:90%
What should I be feeling?

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:37.009 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the lesson for an 8
is to come into their body.

00:42:37.009 --> 00:42:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And know.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And just know and feel,
ah, I'm feeling really sad.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling grief.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm really excited
about that-- in the moment.

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:49.485 align:middle line:84%
And then having a
clear boundary when

00:42:49.485 --> 00:42:52.850 align:middle line:84%
they have feelings to know
other people's issues are here.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Mine are here.

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get
over-involved, because if I do,

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I know we're going
to get in trouble,

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and knowing where
that boundary is.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's about emotional
presence and boundaries and just

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.537 align:middle line:84%
presence and
feeling in the body.

00:43:04.537 --> 00:43:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just
have two more numbers

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and then I have more
questions for you.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.090 align:middle line:84%
What about the number 12
and then the number 16?

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Those are the last two
I'll ask you about.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: The 12 is
all about expansion.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:21.970 align:middle line:84%
It's about the absorption and
expansion of love and ideas.

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:26.250 align:middle line:84%
12 people usually read about
six books at once in parallel.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And they want to absorb
all the knowledge,

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.980 align:middle line:84%
take it to a higher level,
and then take it out

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to the world with a 3, which
we talked about before.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And a 16 is all about
bringing spiritual energies

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:84%
at a high level down
to the earth plane.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And then from the 7, which
goes with a 16, from the heart,

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:46.414 align:middle line:84%
transmitting them in plain
English to the world.

00:43:46.414 --> 00:43:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So taking high-level
concepts and making

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.788 align:middle line:84%
them accessible to
the man on the street,

00:43:49.788 --> 00:43:51.250 align:middle line:90%
the woman on the street.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So they're a bridge
consciousness.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.264 align:middle line:84%
That's what a 16
essentially does,

00:43:55.264 --> 00:43:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and overcoming the
resistance that the ego has

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.997 align:middle line:90%
to engaging spiritually.

00:43:58.997 --> 00:44:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it will try and
focus on just little

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:02.961 align:middle line:84%
physical karmic stuff
rather than dealing with all

00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:05.210 align:middle line:84%
that spiritual stuff, doesn't
want to know about that.

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:06.079 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're doing
your reading on someone,

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.250 align:middle line:84%
if you're putting this
soul contract map together

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:17.090 align:middle line:84%
for them, in this numerology,
as in classical numerology,

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.680 align:middle line:84%
that we know of, the
simpler form of numerology,

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.210 align:middle line:84%
does your first
name, for example,

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:24.450 align:middle line:84%
carry just one of these
numbers as a frequency?

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Or do you look at the
whole thing together?

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Or is there ever just one?

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Or is it always all of these
filling out the Star of David,

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.819 align:middle line:84%
coded down into
the soul contract?

00:44:34.819 --> 00:44:36.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, could I
say, my first name Regina

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:40.550 align:middle line:84%
has this particular
assignment of a number to it?

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Or is that just a piece
of it, is what I'm saying?

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, spirit
looks at the name

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.840 align:middle line:84%
as one continuous
stream of frequencies.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:49.840 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't break it out.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.925 align:middle line:84%
We just have it because
we've got to draw a breath

00:44:51.925 --> 00:44:53.560 align:middle line:90%
and say each name.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It's basically one
set of frequencies.

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:58.537 align:middle line:84%
And then we're decoding it
around the Star of David.

00:44:58.537 --> 00:45:00.370 align:middle line:84%
We're allocating them
in a clockwise spiral.

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can't
say, oh my name is Bob.

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:03.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a 7.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:05.010 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work like that.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: No, no.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:05.790 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.581 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I'm trying to get to.

00:45:07.581 --> 00:45:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: I'm Bob Michael
Hope or whatever,

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.354 align:middle line:84%
and then the entirety
of my name means this.

00:45:12.354 --> 00:45:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: All these six aspects
makes my soul destiny.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.926 align:middle line:90%
That's what it really means.

00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:17.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:18.421 align:middle line:90%
Now I want to go into this.

00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:20.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the final part
of our conversation

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.410 align:middle line:90%
but a really important one.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when you've
outgrown your name and you

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.520 align:middle line:84%
think, it just doesn't-- I
don't like my name anymore.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.430 align:middle line:90%
My life is stuck.

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what can be done

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.291 align:middle line:84%
once a person feels
A-- either stuck,

00:45:32.291 --> 00:45:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're not relating
it to their name.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Or they actually don't
like their name anymore

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:37.420 align:middle line:90%
and want to change it.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.880 align:middle line:90%
And what happens from there?

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, that
means that yes, they'll

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:42.210 align:middle line:90%
reach a plateau of growth.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.854 align:middle line:84%
So that name may be
holding them back.

00:45:45.854 --> 00:45:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Because often it will
be a current name, which

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.080 align:middle line:84%
is infusing its frequencies,
that layer of icing we

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.830 align:middle line:84%
spoke about at the
beginning into the cake

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:54.500 align:middle line:90%
of their birth chart name.

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.470 align:middle line:90%
It's like an overlay name.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So what may be happening is
that they've outgrown it.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So they need a new,
probably more enhanced name

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that's going to infuse a new
set of frequencies, building

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:09.010 align:middle line:84%
on what the current name
did, into their birth name.

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be optimized,
so that it will enable them

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.840 align:middle line:84%
to work through their
karma more easily, to work

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.970 align:middle line:84%
through their goals.
achieve their goals,

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.950 align:middle line:84%
enhance their talents,
maybe ground them,

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe empower them, depending
on what's in the chart.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have a process called
name optimization, which

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.710 align:middle line:90%
basically is just name surgery.

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the soul within
us has an optimal name

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.565 align:middle line:90%
when the time is right.

00:46:31.565 --> 00:46:33.882 align:middle line:84%
It's about connecting with
what's already within us.

00:46:33.882 --> 00:46:35.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
making something up.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.800 align:middle line:84%
It's aligning, as
I said previously,

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.682 align:middle line:84%
with the flow of spirit,
to actually bring

00:46:39.682 --> 00:46:41.140 align:middle line:84%
the best out of
someone so they can

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.556 align:middle line:84%
move to the next stage of their
evolution in their mission

00:46:43.556 --> 00:46:44.770 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
you're reading the book,

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:51.369 align:middle line:84%
and you feel-- you don't want
it to be a shot in the dark.

00:46:51.369 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:90%
Say you're feeling stuck.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So somebody watching
this says, I'm stuck.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't resonate
with my name.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to read this book.

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.280 align:middle line:84%
How do you begin deciphering and
going through and determining

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.090 align:middle line:84%
where you begin
that name change?

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:05.890 align:middle line:84%
It could be I guess
something as simple as maybe

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.440 align:middle line:90%
inserting a middle initial?

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:07.941 align:middle line:90%
Or--?

00:47:07.941 --> 00:47:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Usually we try and have
a little incremental change.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But before we get to
that, we'd actually

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.935 align:middle line:84%
look at what's the core
pattern that's got them stuck?

00:47:14.935 --> 00:47:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And that probably will
be in the birth chart.

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So they need to
address that first.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.934 align:middle line:84%
And changing the
name may be one part

00:47:22.934 --> 00:47:24.100 align:middle line:90%
of actually addressing that.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.055 align:middle line:84%
Because if you infuse the right
frequency, and it will shift.

00:47:27.055 --> 00:47:27.680 align:middle line:90%
But it depends.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.727 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
the situation is.

00:47:29.727 --> 00:47:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But generally, when
the time is right,

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:33.206 align:middle line:84%
someone knows it's
time for a new name.

00:47:33.206 --> 00:47:34.955 align:middle line:84%
And so you need to get
aligned with, well,

00:47:34.955 --> 00:47:39.002 align:middle line:84%
what's my real-- what's my
next step in terms of my goals?

00:47:39.002 --> 00:47:40.470 align:middle line:90%
And then you tune into that.

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And they need to
say to the universe,

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, I need something,
spirit, to help me.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.214 align:middle line:90%
The names will start turning up.

00:47:46.214 --> 00:47:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe,
through the outer world,

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:49.440 align:middle line:90%
will start to answer it.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And they pay attention to that.

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's the raw material
for actually playing

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:55.110 align:middle line:84%
with the name, which is-- that
part's not taught in the book.

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:57.654 align:middle line:84%
That's at another level,
that sort of work.

00:47:57.654 --> 00:47:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But basically
they'll start to get

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:84%
clues of what they
should be called.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.885 align:middle line:84%
It could be a new
middle name, usually,

00:48:01.885 --> 00:48:03.465 align:middle line:90%
or a slight change of spelling.

00:48:03.465 --> 00:48:05.055 align:middle line:90%
Usually it's incremental.

00:48:05.055 --> 00:48:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Or I might meet the right
person and change your name

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:07.900 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.790 align:middle line:90%
What happens as well.

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:11.374 align:middle line:84%
Some people marry
purely for the name.

00:48:11.374 --> 00:48:13.081 align:middle line:84%
And they get divorced
three months later.

00:48:13.081 --> 00:48:14.050 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that happen.

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With a name like
Hilton or something like that.

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:16.871 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:48:16.871 --> 00:48:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:19.220 align:middle line:84%
That name was just
what they needed.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:19.970 align:middle line:90%
So it varies.

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:21.517 align:middle line:84%
Every person's
journey is different.

00:48:21.517 --> 00:48:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: But often we feel
that our name doesn't fit.

00:48:24.355 --> 00:48:26.935 align:middle line:84%
And there's a good reason why.
it will be clear in the system

00:48:26.935 --> 00:48:27.810 align:middle line:90%
why it's not working.

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you just share one
really grand example of someone

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:37.745 align:middle line:84%
that was stuck and you did
this process of optimization on

00:48:37.745 --> 00:48:38.860 align:middle line:90%
and what followed?

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Just so we can have an
example of what's possible.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, I had one
client who was French.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And she moved to England
quite early on in her life.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And her life wasn't
happening that well.

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Because she was using the French
pronunciation of her name.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And then she knew she
had to change her name.

00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:58.220 align:middle line:90%
or had to do something.

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.636 align:middle line:84%
And she was one of my soul
contract reading practitioners.

00:49:00.636 --> 00:49:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So we actually worked out if
we pronounced the first three

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:84%
parts of her name
in English, but left

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.920 align:middle line:84%
her original French name, it
was the perfect name for her.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.256 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did that require
not just a pronunciation

00:49:12.256 --> 00:49:13.505 align:middle line:90%
change, but a spelling change?

00:49:13.505 --> 00:49:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: There wasn't
a spelling change.

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
the pronunciation.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Just the pronunciation.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we discovered the whole
purpose of coming to England

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.380 align:middle line:84%
was to get an English
pronunciation.

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it ended up--
she rang me up and said,

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.783 align:middle line:84%
I'm totally grounded,
Nicholas, for the first time

00:49:24.783 --> 00:49:26.610 align:middle line:84%
in my life, which was
a big change, just

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:27.899 align:middle line:90%
from the changing of her name.

00:49:27.899 --> 00:49:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Because that was the challenge.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:32.220 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't actually arrive
here to deliver her mission.

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:32.800 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She needed that
name, the French name,

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:39.279 align:middle line:84%
but just pronounced
differently, so it sounded as--

00:49:39.279 --> 00:49:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: It was black and white.

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:41.153 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:41.153 --> 00:49:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Just like she was
here, and then she was here.

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And she shifted.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.172 align:middle line:84%
Because the name
actually did it.

00:49:46.172 --> 00:49:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have to
look for any other names.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:49.530 align:middle line:90%
It was just the way we said it.

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about something
that required a small change

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:56.170 align:middle line:84%
in the spelling, or the addition
of an initial or something,

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:58.149 align:middle line:84%
an example of that
and what happened?

00:49:58.149 --> 00:49:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, I can
give mine, for example.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I used to be called
Nicholas Guy.

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Guy was my father's name.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is it?

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Guy.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Guy.

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And now I'm
Nicholas David Ngan.

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And I spent two years trying
every Hebrew male name

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:14.690 align:middle line:84%
you can think of, even the
really out-there names,

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:15.840 align:middle line:90%
long ones.

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.395 align:middle line:90%
And none of them worked.

00:50:17.395 --> 00:50:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened was,
I put it out to the universe,

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:21.390 align:middle line:84%
well, I want to get
on with my mission.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:22.348 align:middle line:90%
I want to be empowered.

00:50:22.348 --> 00:50:24.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to be ground,
I want to serve.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And a client wrote to
me, twice in two weeks,

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.280 align:middle line:90%
using David-- Dear David.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I keep trying to
call you-- I know it's weird--

00:50:31.655 --> 00:50:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Dear David.

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:34.653 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I keep trying to call
you David instead of Nicholas.

00:50:34.653 --> 00:50:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, why?

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Well, it's quite strong.

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when I saw the
second letter, I thought,

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:40.690 align:middle line:90%
I can take a hint.

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And so I
tried the name out.

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the simplest, most
straightforward Hebrew name

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:49.090 align:middle line:90%
was the perfect name.

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:52.459 align:middle line:84%
And I changed the
name in about 2006.

00:50:52.459 --> 00:50:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
happened in your life?

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well what happened
was that I got more grounded.

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.030 align:middle line:84%
I came more into
my-- I could feel

00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:59.970 align:middle line:84%
my way through my
disempowerment.

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I could feel my way
through my unworthiness.

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I resolved massive
issues with my mother

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.260 align:middle line:84%
because it put a lot of
feminine energy into my chart.

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:13.610 align:middle line:84%
It networked me with all
the right people, basically

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:17.852 align:middle line:84%
grounded my mission, got me
here today, got my book written.

00:51:17.852 --> 00:51:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Everything started to happen.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.220 align:middle line:90%
It took time.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I saw
the chart, the effect

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.880 align:middle line:84%
of the overlay of the new
name on the birth name,

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.130 align:middle line:90%
I knew this is the right name.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:28.899 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't what
my mind was thinking.

00:51:28.899 --> 00:51:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: I just had to
surrender, which I had.

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.370 align:middle line:90%
I'd given up and said, OK.

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:34.869 align:middle line:84%
I said, spirit, just tell me,
because I've tried everything.

00:51:34.869 --> 00:51:36.890 align:middle line:90%
And I know how this works.

00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:37.530 align:middle line:90%
I can't get it.

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so funny,
because, like I said,

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I keep wanting to call you
David instead of Nicholas.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas is a powerful and
beautiful name as well.

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:44.870 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.459 align:middle line:84%
But I keep feeling
the David part of you,

00:51:47.459 --> 00:51:49.500 align:middle line:84%
even though that's the
name you chose to take on.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the names
we choose to take on

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:53.499 align:middle line:84%
can be even more powerful,
though, can't they?

00:51:53.499 --> 00:51:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Well, yeah.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.710 align:middle line:10%
It sort of just gave me
all the right frequencies

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:58.790 align:middle line:10%
to actually make
this mission happen.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.912 align:middle line:10%
So I'm actually in
the flow much more.

00:52:01.912 --> 00:52:03.620 align:middle line:10%
And I've had a massive
amount of healing.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:06.840 align:middle line:10%
It's taken six to eight years.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.714 align:middle line:84%
But actually that was the
beginning of the huge change.

00:52:09.714 --> 00:52:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
need to be careful

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:14.291 align:middle line:84%
when we're naming our children,
be very in tune and open.

00:52:14.291 --> 00:52:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: You're setting someone's
entire life in that moment.

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:17.999 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big responsibility.

00:52:17.999 --> 00:52:19.623 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
don't just necessarily

00:52:19.623 --> 00:52:21.710 align:middle line:84%
name them after your
mother and your grandmother

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:23.301 align:middle line:84%
and your grandfather
and so forth.

00:52:23.301 --> 00:52:25.550 align:middle line:84%
You need to be just a little
more intuitive than that,

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:25.790 align:middle line:90%
would you say?

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:28.123 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Intuitive and take
time and do what feels right.

00:52:28.123 --> 00:52:30.917 align:middle line:84%
Look at who arrives
and see, does it fit?

00:52:30.917 --> 00:52:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Does it feel right?

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
not to be upset

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:37.850 align:middle line:84%
with a child or a relative
or a friend when they choose

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:41.410 align:middle line:84%
to completely revamp their
name, to support them on that.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, often
children nowadays,

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.030 align:middle line:84%
they can feel that
something's not right.

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.027 align:middle line:90%
So they'll try and adjust it.

00:52:47.027 --> 00:52:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: But with a bit of
conscious help with this work,

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.580 align:middle line:90%
you can really tune it up.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.499 align:middle line:84%
But often they know
what they want.

00:52:52.499 --> 00:52:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Or they know something's
not good for them.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at it,
it isn't good for them.

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:57.101 align:middle line:90%
It's actually not helping them.

00:52:57.101 --> 00:52:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:57.930 --> 00:52:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have not--
I read the book,

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:02.620 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't actually
taken the time

00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:05.960 align:middle line:84%
to do my chart, my own
chart, my own star map.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.117 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward
to it, starting

00:53:08.117 --> 00:53:09.950 align:middle line:84%
with the birth name and
the name I have now.

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And see what's
happened, what has

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.180 align:middle line:90%
transformed through the years.

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:15.245 align:middle line:84%
I think that would be
a fascinating process.

00:53:15.245 --> 00:53:15.786 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:53:15.786 --> 00:53:18.385 align:middle line:84%
Well, the book is designed
to look at your birth chart,

00:53:18.385 --> 00:53:19.635 align:middle line:90%
to explain what happens there.

00:53:19.635 --> 00:53:21.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't explain the
effect of the overlay

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.390 align:middle line:84%
of your current
name, because that's

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:24.602 align:middle line:90%
another level of the work.

00:53:24.602 --> 00:53:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But you need to understand--
that will probably

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.359 align:middle line:90%
be a future book.

00:53:27.359 --> 00:53:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: But you need
to actually understand

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.550 align:middle line:84%
the essence of
who you are first.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot
of material in there,

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and when you
understand that, you've

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.990 align:middle line:90%
just taken charge of your life.

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized when
I finished the book,

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.200 align:middle line:84%
is that spirit was actually
writing a manual for ascension,

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.869 align:middle line:84%
a manual for light work
is especially, on anyone,

00:53:43.869 --> 00:53:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to actually take
charge of their life

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and live it to the
best that they can

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:51.360 align:middle line:84%
so that they can become free
of the constraints of the ego

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and best if you deliver their
gift of love and service

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:54.990 align:middle line:90%
however that is.

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.890 align:middle line:90%
That's the purpose of the book.

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:56.473 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:56.473 --> 00:53:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a very
refined system.

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And you've done a
lot to forward it

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:03.670 align:middle line:90%
from what Frank initially did.

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot to be
grateful for in that.

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, it's
been my privilege

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:09.087 align:middle line:90%
to actually be that custodian.

00:54:09.087 --> 00:54:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts before we go?

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.122 align:middle line:10%
>>NGAN: I would say that
the book will allow people

00:54:16.122 --> 00:54:18.080 align:middle line:10%
to follow their spiritual
signature eventually,

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.454 align:middle line:10%
if they work on
themselves enough

00:54:19.454 --> 00:54:22.810 align:middle line:10%
and align to their
true purpose and really

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:26.435 align:middle line:10%
maximize the experience of
this lifetime and the shift

00:54:26.435 --> 00:54:28.000 align:middle line:10%
in consciousness
we're going through.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.541 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's quite a gift
to your family, your children

00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:33.200 align:middle line:84%
especially, if you can see
what their soul contract is

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.900 align:middle line:90%
from a very early age, too.

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah, it means
we can consciously

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.523 align:middle line:84%
relate to everyone
in our lives, which

00:54:37.523 --> 00:54:39.930 align:middle line:84%
makes everyone's life a
lot easier and more joyful.

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:41.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't ask for
much more than that.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.812 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, we cannot.

00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:43.640 align:middle line:90%
We cannot.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.807 align:middle line:84%
And thank you again so much
for your time, Nicholas.

00:54:45.807 --> 00:54:47.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Thank you for
having me on the show.

00:54:47.639 --> 00:54:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nicholas David.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:52.500 align:middle line:10%
Again, the book is titled,
Your Soul Contract Decoded.

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.000 align:middle line:10%
And it's a hands-on
workbook to help

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.010 align:middle line:10%
you get a clearer understanding
of what your soul is trying

00:54:57.010 --> 00:54:59.040 align:middle line:10%
to express in this lifetime.

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Again, wonderful thing to
do for your family as well.

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:05.814 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:55:05.814 --> 00:55:09.956 align:middle line:90%
