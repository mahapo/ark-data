[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I'm
thrilled to have back with me

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.400 align:middle line:10%
Michael Cremo, author of
"Forbidden Archeology"

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:10%
and Vedic scholar.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm particularly
fascinated with the Vedas

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:84%
because they predate all other
known religious histories,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and they can help us
find cross-validation

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
for some other
historical stories.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:84%
In addition, in
this conversation,

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Michael and I will also
explore various destructions

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:84%
throughout history, including
the use of nuclear weapons.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Michael, so good
to have you back.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:90%
You're just-- you're the font.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL CREMO: Good
to be with you, Regina.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean,
you've taken this so far.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked before,
in our last interview, how

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.470 align:middle line:84%
your understanding of the
Vedas have really driven you

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:84%
into deep, deep research,
hard on the ground

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:84%
scientific research as
to our historical roots,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
probably more than anybody
else that I've sat with.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And because the story
has been so confused

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and muddled, to the point
of being a slave species,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to try to unpack
some of that a little bit,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
go back, predate all
of it, and then see

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
where these stories have kind
of popped up within the longer

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.805 align:middle line:90%
lineage of it.

00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought we'd start
at the beginning, which

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:84%
is in the Vedas, how far
back does human history go?

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL CREMO: It
goes back forever.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:10%
You have to understand that
the Vedic cosmology involves

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.950 align:middle line:10%
a cyclical concept of time.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And the basic unit
of this cyclical time

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
is called the Kalpa,
or the Day of Brahma.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Brahma is the creator god
in the Vedic cosmology,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and his day lasts for
4,320,000,000 years.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:84%
It's followed by
a night which also

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:90%
lasts for 4,320,000,000 years.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another
day, another night.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:90%
The cycle goes on endlessly.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And during the days of Brahma,
life, including human life,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:84%
is manifest in the
universe and the cosmos,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and during the nights
of Brahma, everything

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:84%
is dormant in a sleeping
or dreaming state.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Now according to the Vedic
cosmological calendar,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:84%
we are about halfway through
the current Day of Brahma, which

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.800 align:middle line:84%
means it began about
two billion years ago.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So as a Vedic
archeologist, I would

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:84%
expect to find evidence for a
human presence going back about

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.610 align:middle line:90%
two billion years on Earth.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And the Vedic writings
speak of such things.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's
the Bhagavata Purana.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:10%
The Puranas are the historical
writings of ancient India.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:10%
The Bhagavata Purana says
that at the beginning

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:10%
of the Day of Brahma, there were
human beings living on Earth,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:10%
and even gives examples of them.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:90%
One of them was--

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.220 align:middle line:90%
his name was Dhruva--

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.859 align:middle line:90%
he was a very saintly king.

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this would date
to two billion years ago.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we have to
look at the Day of Brahma.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It is divided into subcycles
called Manvantaras.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.230 align:middle line:84%
A Day of Brahma is divided
into 14 Manvantara periods.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And after each of them
there's a devastation

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:84%
after which the Earth
has to be repopulated.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Each Manvantara lasts
roughly 300 million years,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I think about 306 million
years, to be exact.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And after each one,
there's a devastation.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Now we're currently in
the seventh Manvantara

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.920 align:middle line:84%
of the current Kalpa
or Day of Brahma.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
That means there have
been six before us.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And that means there have
been six devastations

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
after which the Earth
had to be repopulated.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Now this personality, Dhruva,
that I was mentioning,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Bhagavata Purana,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:84%
he existed during
the first Manvantara.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's a sacred city
in India called Mathura,

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and in Mathura there are
temples and sacred places that

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.440 align:middle line:84%
are dedicated to the memory
of this person who existed

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:84%
during the first
Manvantara of the Kalpa

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle line:90%
about two billion years ago.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Even before that, there
was a Night of Brahma.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Before that, there was
another Day of Brahma.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Human beings were existing.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And then before that,
there was another Day

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:90%
of Brahma, another, another.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So the human body,
which is actually

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:84%
a vehicle for the soul,
for the conscious self,

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:84%
has always been available
for conscious selves who

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:84%
come to this level of
reality, material reality.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:84%
The original home of
the conscious self,

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:84%
the world of Brahma or
spirit or pure consciousness,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:90%
is beyond time.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:84%
There are no cycles of
creation and destruction.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
That is our original home to
which we are meant to return.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But for those conscious
selves in the world of matter,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:84%
different vehicles are available
to them, human vehicles,

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
animal vehicles, plant
vehicles, all kinds of vehicles.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Among them, the human
vehicle is the most valuable

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:84%
because in the human
vehicle, we have the chance

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
to restore consciousness
to its original pure state

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.660 align:middle line:84%
beyond the cycles of
creation and destruction

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that eternally go on on this
material level of reality.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually the
most important purpose

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.790 align:middle line:90%
of human life.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a
question, a follow-up there.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is this
is true not just on Earth,

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.730 align:middle line:90%
but throughout the cosmos.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
The human vehicle is populated
throughout the cosmos.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Do, then, other planets,
I assume, star systems,

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:84%
also abide by the
same days of Brahma

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and the same rules of
creation, destruction?

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: According
to the Puranas,

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
the Vedic cosmological
texts, there

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:84%
are 400,000 human-like
species scattered

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:90%
throughout the entire cosmos.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's a multi-level
cosmos with different levels,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
with different
kinds of energies.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
The level that we're on
now is a very gross level

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:90%
in terms of its energy density.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
There are more subtle
realms of the cosmos.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:84%
There's still
material, but they're

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
made of more subtle mental,
intellectual, and egotistical

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And on that level,
the beings have

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
vehicles made of more
subtle elements than we do,

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and they have a longer
span of life that we do.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, that
same human type of vehicle

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
is there, but in a
more subtle form.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And even that form
is a reflection

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:90%
of a higher spiritual reality.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:84%
The pure conscious self, in
its pure spiritual essence,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:90%
has form and senses.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And whatever we experience
on this level of reality

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
is a reflection of something
that is ultimately real.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The Vedic sages sometimes
give the example

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:90%
of a tree reflected in water.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:10%
If you see the reflection
of the tree in the water,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:10%
it's not the ultimate reality.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:middle line:84%
If you try to take the fruit
from the tree reflected

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:90%
in the water, you don't get it.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But it points to the
existence of a real tree.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So our human form on
this level of reality,

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
it's limited in so
many ways in terms

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
of being subjected to birth,
death, old age, disease,

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:84%
different kinds of trauma,
psychological trauma,

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:90%
physical trauma.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:84%
But it points to the existence
of something that really

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:90%
exists of the higher level.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why we're so
dissatisfied with our condition

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
here is that deep inside
we have some memory

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:90%
of being beyond all of that.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're meant
to recover in our journey

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
through existence on
this level of reality.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And why, when they
speak of the human as being

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:84%
the ideal form to be able to
progress consciousness through,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to, perhaps,
other animal species or plant

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:90%
species, is it in our innate--

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
almost the geometrical or
the chakric system, or what

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:84%
is it that's unique
about the human form that

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
allows for the rising of
consciousness in this way?

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: The ability
to distinguish

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:84%
between consciousness
and matter.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in today's
world, many scientists

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:90%
don't make such a distinction.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
They would say, well, we're
just machines made of molecules.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:90%
That's all there is to it.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.700 align:middle line:84%
As far as consciousness
is concerned,

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:84%
that's just a
temporary byproduct

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:84%
of bioelectrical
activity in the brain.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And when, at the time
of death, the chemicals

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
of the brain become
disorganized,

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.920 align:middle line:84%
there's no more mind,
no more consciousness,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:90%
nothing like that.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't accept that.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nor do I.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: The Vedic
sages don't accept that.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.800 align:middle line:84%
They accept that
consciousness has

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
its own independent
existence apart from matter.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's the highest
form of intelligence,

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:84%
to be able to distinguish
consciousness from matter

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to act
always on the platform

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:90%
of pure consciousness.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And the ruling principle of
that level of pure consciousness

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:84%
is harmonious,
loving cooperation

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:84%
among all conscious
beings and what

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I would call the source
of all conscious beings.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So the importance
of the human vehicle

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.840 align:middle line:84%
is that the conscious
self and the human vehicle

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:84%
can use it to transcend all
kinds of lower identifications

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:13.402 align:middle line:84%
and identify with the
highest aspects of the self.

00:13:13.402 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You brought
something up a moment ago

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:84%
that I have never actually
talked with anyone about.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just a perception
that I have.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is the notion that
in this creative process

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:84%
at very high levels, and
these human beings at finer

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
levels of density, that
there is still the sensual

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:90%
awareness of their reality.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:90%
And you may or may not--

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.390 align:middle line:84%
you may be able to answer
this well, I don't know.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
In the process of
creation of the thought,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:84%
the dreamer creating
this physical expression

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:84%
into the cosmos, is this a
sensorial process as well?

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And I ask because some people
say, eh, it's all down to math,

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:90%
for example, or whatever.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
believed it's down

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to many, many constituents,
including a sensual dream

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
The absolute is sentient,
which means it has senses.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.060 align:middle line:90%
It has awareness.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And on the higher
level of reality

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
which we're meant to exist on,
we possess spiritual senses.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:84%
We have those spiritual senses
now, but they're covered over.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we're experiencing
a virtual reality system

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately, on
that higher spiritual level

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:46.980 align:middle line:84%
of reality, all of our
sensory experiences

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
are done and carried out in a
spirit of pure love, devotion,

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:90%
harmony.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And if a conscious self
becomes egotistical, selfish,

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
domineering,
exploiting, controlling,

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.600 align:middle line:84%
then those senses
can no longer be

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
used, the spiritual senses,
because they're only

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:90%
meant for one purpose.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So we give an alternative
set of senses,

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:84%
as you would be given in
a virtual reality system.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:84%
You have your normal
eyes and ears,

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and they're meant to experience
their normal objects.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But a virtual reality
system, your senses

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:84%
are channeled into
another whole set

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:47.165 align:middle line:84%
of experiences of sights,
sounds, motions, smells,

00:15:47.165 --> 00:15:47.965 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:15:47.965 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:84%
But it still is a
sensory experience.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.040 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the
material sensory experience

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:84%
is it's subjected to
all kinds of limitations

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.940 align:middle line:84%
that we're conscious
of, that we're aware of.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling of
discomfort that we have

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
is a result of a deeper
understanding in ourselves

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're meant to be
experiencing a higher

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:90%
sensory reality.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But in this world, we have
a subtle sensory apparatus,

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:84%
a subtle material
sensory apparatus

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that operates through the
gross physical organs.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.790 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Vedic understanding,

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:56.620 align:middle line:84%
we have five knowledge-acquiring
senses and five acting senses.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge-acquiring senses
are vision, hearing smelling,

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:90%
tasting, touching.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.920 align:middle line:84%
The working senses,
the senses for acting,

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
are the arms, the legs,
the tongue for speaking,

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and the genitals and the
organs of evacuation.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:25.992 align:middle line:84%
But these subtle senses,
they operate through the--

00:17:25.992 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The grosser senses.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Grosser
physical organs,

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:84%
like the subtle
grasping sense operates

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:84%
through the physical
organ of the arm and hand.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's an interesting
medical phenomenon

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
called phantom limbs, where
a person might lose or not

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.870 align:middle line:84%
be born with a
limb but still feel

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:84%
that they have it, and even
feel pain and sensation in it,

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and they have to take
medication for it.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
interesting phenomenon.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's part of that
blueprint, the finer blueprint.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: The finer blueprint,
that even if you take away

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:12.530 align:middle line:84%
the gross physical sense, the
subtle sense is still there.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good example.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:90%
This brings me to another area.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
A little bit ago you said if
these things go out of balance,

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and we end up with control
and deceit and destruction

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.997 align:middle line:84%
and all these things,
what popped into my mind--

00:18:25.997 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and this is probably
because of an interview

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I just did yesterday-- is that
has become known detrimentally

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:84%
as the negative effects
of patriarchal society,

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.260 align:middle line:90%
the outcomes of that.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just
realizing that that is

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
such a really inaccurate
description of it.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:84%
It's simply a set of
traits that are out

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
of balance that may have been
under the authorship of men

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.900 align:middle line:90%
for a period of history.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about it
in its more refined state,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.870 align:middle line:84%
the masculine and the
feminine combined,

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and the way they
express themselves

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:90%
through this creation.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: You know, it's a very
interesting question, Regina.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:84%
In terms of modern science, the
existence of male and female

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:90%
is a complete mystery.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:84%
According to their way
of looking at things,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:84%
in the very beginning
there was no consciousness,

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:84%
there were no personalities
to speak of, male and female.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:90%
There were just chemicals.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.392 align:middle line:90%
And somehow--

00:19:29.392 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Chromosomes
that mutated.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: They would say
not even chromosomes.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:90%
That comes later.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:90%
Just chemicals.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And they believe
that somehow or other

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:84%
they combined to form some
first self-reproducing organism,

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:48.860 align:middle line:84%
some single-celled organism
that reproduced not sexually,

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:90%
but just by dividing asexually.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And how those
single-celled creatures

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:84%
started turning into
multi-cellular creatures that

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:06.800 align:middle line:84%
developed a sexual process
of reproduction involving

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.260 align:middle line:84%
male and female is really
an unsolved mystery.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's not a
mystery because everything

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:84%
I see on this level of
reality I understand

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:84%
is a reflection of something
that exists on some higher

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:90%
spiritual level of reality.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So on that higher
level of reality,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
the source of all conscious
beings, God, if you will,

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:84%
exists in both male
and female form.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And the system of
spiritual knowledge

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:84%
that comes from ancient India,
these two personalities, male

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and female, who are the
ultimate source of everything,

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:90%
are given names.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Radha and Krishna are
common names, Lakshmi

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:90%
and Narayan, Sita and Ram.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
The first name is the female
energy and personality.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
The second name is
the male personality.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:90%
And they exist in harmony.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.580 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes what
happens in this world

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:35.480 align:middle line:84%
is that people focus on one
or the other of those two

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:84%
original genders as
they are expressed

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.290 align:middle line:90%
on this level of reality.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
the imbalance and the lack

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:90%
of harmony comes in.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Some will focus on one to
the exclusion of the other,

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
when the real truth is, both
exist in loving harmony.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would have
to be at the basis of all

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
of creation of all things,
because it is intrinsically

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:90%
balanced.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And yet in the western
world, because we've

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
had religions that have had a
patriarchal solo male presence

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:90%
in a vacuum--

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:84%
no mother, no wife, no
children-- just a male entity,

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, as the
kind of governing

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.180 align:middle line:84%
lord of our cosmos
or our planet,

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.260 align:middle line:84%
it's created this incredible
perception of male authority

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and thus imbalance because of
buying into that solo male god

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
scenario has done
a lot of damage

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:84%
to the psyche of the
people on this planet.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.842 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, going
to the opposite extreme

00:22:38.842 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:90%
would be just as wrong.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.716 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It would be.

00:22:40.716 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:84%
If it were the
other way, exactly.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But isolated in itself,
without the two,

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.350 align:middle line:90%
imbalance has been the problem.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: I agree.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.090 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.056 align:middle line:90%
That was a little sidetrack.

00:22:56.056 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get on
to the Vedas and how

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:84%
they start expressing themselves
and some of the lore that,

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:84%
certainly, we would
do on shows like this,

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.740 align:middle line:84%
looking at what is known
as the Lemurian culture

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:90%
and the Atlantean culture.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:16.820 align:middle line:84%
How do the Vedas view
these epochs of history?

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Are they given different
names, different locations?

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Is it considered something
entirely different?

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
those evolutions

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.350 align:middle line:90%
within human history.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well,
according to the Vedas,

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.840 align:middle line:84%
there are cycles within
cycles within cycles.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And we've mentioned some of
the larger cycles, the Kalpas,

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
the Day of Brahma,
the Manvantars,

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:84%
which last about
300 million years.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And then each Manvantar is
made of a cycle of 71 Yugas,

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:03.180 align:middle line:90%
71 cycles of four Yugas.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So the first Yuga is
called Satya Yuga.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:12.650 align:middle line:84%
It's an age of truth,
harmony, and people.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
According to the Puranas,
during the Satya Yuga,

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:90%
they live for 100,000 years.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:90%
There are no classes.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is involved
in yoga and meditation

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:90%
and contemplation.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:36.230 align:middle line:84%
They live very
simply and naturally.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And that Yuga is followed
by the Treta Yuga,

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and in the Treta Yuga, things
become degraded by about 25%.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And people in the Treta Yuga,
according to the ancient texts,

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:90%
live for 10,000 years.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And they divide
themselves into classes.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Some are intellectuals,
some are rulers,

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:13.840 align:middle line:84%
some are farmers
or business people,

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and then others are
artisans and laborers.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to live in
towns and villages and cities.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And there begins to be
some division in society.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's still-- even though
these divisions are there--

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.744 align:middle line:84%
people are still trying to act
in harmony with each other.

00:25:34.744 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell me the name
of that particular cycle.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: The Treta Yuga.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's followed
by the Dvapara Yuga,

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's said that in that age,
people live for 1,000 years.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And there are conflicts,
major conflicts that start.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:84%
But they are
conflicts that go on

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.760 align:middle line:84%
according to some kind
of civilized rules

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.660 align:middle line:90%
and regulations.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Now we find ourselves in the
fourth age, called the Kali

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Yuga, where people live
a maximum of 100 years,

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and practically all spiritual
principles are gone.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a time of increasing
environmental and social

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:90%
disturbance.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it
sounds pretty bleak,

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.580 align:middle line:84%
but just because
it's raining doesn't

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.680 align:middle line:90%
mean you have to get wet.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:84%
You can shelter yourself,
you can shelter others,

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.780 align:middle line:90%
you can turn even the Kali Yuga.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
At least for you and
whoever is trying to do it

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:90%
into another Golden Age.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:90%
That ability is there.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It all depends upon the
choices that we make as beings

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:90%
of pure consciousness.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where does it go
after that, after the Kali Yuga?

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: To another Satya
Yuga, another Golden Age.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're back and then we're
going through this again.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Again and
again and again.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where
in that would you

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:84%
place what we commonly
think to be Lemuria

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.760 align:middle line:90%
or Atlantis and those cultures?

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: I would just say
those kinds of cultures

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
refer back to at least
the Dvapara Yuga.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the features
of the Dvapara Yuga

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:46.260 align:middle line:84%
is that people were in touch
with higher beings at higher

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.680 align:middle line:90%
levels of the cosmos.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Different cultures,
they had different names

00:27:50.880 --> 00:28:00.540 align:middle line:84%
for the gods, goddesses, devas,
jinn, whatever, astral beings.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.210 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be a
feature of cultures

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:84%
that existed before the
beginning of Kali Yuga, which

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:90%
was about 5,000 years ago.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They had highly developed
technologies, perhaps

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:20.730 align:middle line:84%
based on a more subtle
science than we have today.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
our science today

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
is our attempt to
duplicate the achievements

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.030 align:middle line:84%
of previous cultures
and denser energies.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about technologies.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.980 align:middle line:84%
As you say, through these
various larger cycles,

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.919 align:middle line:84%
we go through
these destructions.

00:28:39.919 --> 00:28:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get to the subject

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:84%
of the process of repopulating
the planet in a little bit.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
some of the destructions,

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.920 align:middle line:84%
because some of the
destructions that

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.170 align:middle line:84%
have written about in
even Sumerian texts,

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:84%
also, speak of what appears to
be almost a nuclear-type effect

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.970 align:middle line:90%
on the population.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And explain what that
looks like, and maybe even

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:84%
time frames from the
Vedas or the Puranas.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, according
to the Puranas,

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:18.450 align:middle line:84%
there have been huge
wars that have occurred.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.340 align:middle line:84%
There have also been periodic
natural catastrophes.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So both of them can be
extremely destructive.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:32.400 align:middle line:84%
As far as the wars
that have gone on,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the weapons employed
in these wars

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.840 align:middle line:84%
have been described
in the Puranas.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of the weapons
was called a Brahmastra,

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and its effects are
described as being

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:54.160 align:middle line:84%
as if you were to have a million
suns suddenly come together.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And explode?

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: It's considered
to be the ultimate weapon.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So there are descriptions
in the Puranas

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:84%
of the use of this weapon, which
resembles, in certain ways,

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:15.150 align:middle line:84%
the effects of modern
thermonuclear weapons in terms

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.480 align:middle line:90%
of the effects of them.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And the effects of
these weapons were known

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:90%
to Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and in
fact, that takes us

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.640 align:middle line:90%
right into a little video clip.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.600 align:middle line:84%
You want to go ahead and
take a look at it now?

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.200 align:middle line:84%
It's so heartrending
to me that I thought

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.310 align:middle line:90%
we should put it in here.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's take a peek.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:41.090 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:42.590 align:middle line:84%
- The world would
not be the same.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Two people laughed.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:90%


00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Few people cried.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Most people were silent.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.130 align:middle line:90%


00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I remembered the line from the
Hindu scripture, "The Baghavad

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Gita."

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.555 align:middle line:90%


00:31:05.555 --> 00:31:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Vishnu was trying to persuade
the prince that he should

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:22.170 align:middle line:84%
do his duty, and to impress him,
takes on his multi-armed form,

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and says, now I am become
death, the destroyer of worlds.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:30.098 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.098 --> 00:31:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I suppose we all thought
that, one way or another.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
pain in his being,

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.780 align:middle line:84%
wondering what he has helped
release into the world.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.760 align:middle line:10%
>>CREMO: Well, yeah, he was in
charge of the American project

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:50.740 align:middle line:10%
to develop the atomic
bomb during World War II.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.960 align:middle line:84%
But he was also a student
of the ancient Sanskrit

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:84%
writings of India, and he
was aware of the descriptions

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:02.850 align:middle line:84%
of these weapons in
those ancient writings.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
position to be in,

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.450 align:middle line:84%
for him to understand
the devastation that

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.880 align:middle line:84%
could take place as
a result of these,

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and yet to be heading the
team that would develop them.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I look at that on
a soul level, what could

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:84%
his soul have been
choosing at that moment?

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: I guess it was a
very difficult decision,

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:31.390 align:middle line:84%
because perhaps the
other side, which

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:35.800 align:middle line:84%
included forces much
darker, were also

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:84%
on the verge of
getting these weapons.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
we find the ancient Sanskrit

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:51.980 align:middle line:84%
writings of India, that there
have been conflicts going on

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:57.390 align:middle line:84%
throughout the cosmos, including
on our planet, that involve

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:03.470 align:middle line:84%
beings that we could say
represent forces of darkness,

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:09.920 align:middle line:84%
forces of light, those trying
to get more and more deeply

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.560 align:middle line:84%
involved in domination,
control, exploitation, conflict,

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and those trying
to understand we're

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:22.640 align:middle line:84%
all beings of pure
consciousness.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So at different
points in history,

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:84%
that conflict has been
going on on a cosmic level.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It's also been
going on our planet.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are descriptions of
how the higher representatives

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:45.200 align:middle line:84%
of both the forces
of good and darkness

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.300 align:middle line:84%
are trying to influence
the course of events

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.330 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And talk about that
for a little bit.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:84%
It's as though the higher and
lower realms meet here and play

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.390 align:middle line:90%
out their influence with us.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And what is the nature
of these influences?

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, ultimately the
source of all conscious beings

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:20.739 align:middle line:84%
is trying to arrange a situation
in which the maximum number

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:23.590 align:middle line:84%
of conscious selves
go back to the level

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.409 align:middle line:90%
of pure consciousness.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:28.580 align:middle line:84%
That's how you
should actually judge

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.560 align:middle line:84%
the success of a
civilization or a nation, not

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.960 align:middle line:84%
by gross national product
or how big the military is

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:42.159 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, but how
many conscious selves are

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:47.320 align:middle line:84%
transcending the world
of matter and going back

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:84%
to the level of
pure consciousness

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:53.389 align:middle line:84%
beyond the world
of birth and death.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:58.660 align:middle line:84%
That is the ultimate test of
a civilization or a nation

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.960 align:middle line:90%
or a society or a culture.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So to facilitate that, there
have always been avatars.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Avatars mean those who
descend from the higher

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:16.400 align:middle line:84%
level to the lower
level to teach,

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.600 align:middle line:84%
to give knowledge,
to give techniques,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to help conscious selves
restore their original level

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.030 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And at different
times in history,

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.820 align:middle line:84%
there have been
civilizations and cultures

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.180 align:middle line:84%
that are structured
to facilitate that,

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:41.530 align:middle line:84%
to help people facilitate
their material needs,

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:46.390 align:middle line:84%
to satisfy their material needs
in the most simple, natural,

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:84%
fair, and efficient way
possible while putting most

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:57.910 align:middle line:84%
of the effort of human society
into raising consciousness back

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.870 align:middle line:90%
to its original level.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about ancient
civilizations like Lemuria

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and Atlantis, and
there are descriptions

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.680 align:middle line:84%
of similar civilizations
in the ancient Sanskrit

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:20.540 align:middle line:84%
writings of India that were
organized on that basis.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
forces in the cosmos that

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.990 align:middle line:84%
would like to keep
conscious selves involved

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:33.280 align:middle line:84%
in trying to dominate,
control, and exploit

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.710 align:middle line:90%
matter in competing groups.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that
simply is their own directive

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:43.480 align:middle line:84%
from where they are from,
within their society?

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: It's a decision
that they've made.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.220 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ideally, even
such personalities

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:58.007 align:middle line:84%
can come to understand that
that's the wrong thing.

00:36:58.007 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's their
level of awareness right now.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: That's their
level of awareness.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it fair to say
that in having that influence,

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:10.280 align:middle line:84%
even though it might not be
desirable on this planet,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
it could perhaps speed up
our own evolution simply

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.170 align:middle line:84%
by the opportunity to learn
through the contrast of the two

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.450 align:middle line:90%
meeting within us and without?

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Yes, that
could be an impetus.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.280 align:middle line:84%
There are different ways
for people to learn lessons.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.400 align:middle line:84%
One is just to hear about
what the right thing to do

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.900 align:middle line:90%
is and then do it.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is to
experience someone else

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:44.830 align:middle line:84%
doing the wrong thing
and seeing what happens.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Then you could
think, well, I don't

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:50.260 align:middle line:84%
want to go down
that road, so I'm

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:55.630 align:middle line:84%
going to dedicate my life
to higher principles,

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:90%
we could call them.

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes it has
to happen to us for us

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.770 align:middle line:90%
to make a change in our lives.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough just to
hear about the right thing

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and the wrong thing, or see
it happening to someone else.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have to experience
some negativity ourselves

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:30.860 align:middle line:84%
in order to have the impetus to
adopt a better way of thinking,

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.107 align:middle line:90%
feeling, and willing.

00:38:33.107 --> 00:38:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it seems to me,
as we look around the world

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.310 align:middle line:84%
today, that collectively
we appear to be

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.860 align:middle line:90%
learning through contrast.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Is that a fair way to view it?

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're each
highly individualized

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:50.470 align:middle line:84%
in our own processing of the
world right now at this period.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But collectively, that's
what it's looking like.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: It does, and it's
a feature of the age of Kali

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:03.340 align:middle line:84%
that it's predicted to be a time
of ever-increasing social and

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.950 align:middle line:90%
environmental disturbance.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that
happening, but we

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:13.170 align:middle line:90%
don't have to go with the flow.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:18.370 align:middle line:84%
As conscious selves, we
always have the ability

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:23.960 align:middle line:84%
to use our free will to make
choices that will take us

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:29.740 align:middle line:90%
in a more desirable direction.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there are choices
that we're making within this.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're watching ourself
learning very heavily

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:84%
through contrast
and destruction.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And many people do
appear to be starting

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.950 align:middle line:84%
to ask different questions
now in the internal desire

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.010 align:middle line:84%
to move back up into
the realms of higher

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.780 align:middle line:90%
consciousness within us again.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But as you say,
these destructions

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:56.920 align:middle line:84%
do happen periodically,
wipes the slate clean.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that's what
we're headed for, but I mean,

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.340 align:middle line:90%
it does happen.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into that process
of once we've gone too far

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:84%
out of balance, once a
massive destruction, be

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.020 align:middle line:84%
it natural or
otherwise, does occur,

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.110 align:middle line:84%
there is a process
for repopulating

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:84%
the planet and beings
that help oversee that.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.090 align:middle line:84%
There are these
periodic devastations

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:26.960 align:middle line:84%
that take place at the end of
each Manvantar in particular.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're now in the middle
of a Manvantar period.

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're
not really slated

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.482 align:middle line:90%
for that to happen right now.

00:40:34.482 --> 00:40:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Not right now.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.660 align:middle line:90%
In about 180 million years.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:44.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, in December of 2012,
I was a speaker on a cruise ship

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.910 align:middle line:84%
that went to some of the
Mayan sites like Chichen Itza.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was speaking about
the Vedic time cycles.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Many people were
concerned at that time

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:59.440 align:middle line:84%
because one of the time cycles
mentioned in the Mayan calendar

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:04.810 align:middle line:84%
was about to come to
an end, and some people

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.890 align:middle line:84%
thought that that might involve
some kind of cosmic catastrophe

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.910 align:middle line:90%
or devastation.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And I told them, that is coming,
but not in December 2012.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It's about 180 million
years from now.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was very
comforting, I'm sure.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: So you can register
for your next year's classes

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:23.950 align:middle line:90%
at school.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:27.880 align:middle line:84%
You can continue to make
plans for your life.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you were right.

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: But it will happen.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:32.070 align:middle line:90%
It has happened.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.810 align:middle line:90%


00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:90%
The Earth does get repopulated.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.870 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's helpful
to think of this

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:43.600 align:middle line:90%
in terms of cloud computing.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:84%
People keep their
files and their songs

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and their pictures on
the cloud, in the cloud,

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:57.160 align:middle line:84%
so if their device
happens to get destroyed,

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:02.360 align:middle line:84%
well, you can always download
it again from the cloud.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So our cosmos is arranged
sort of like that,

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.850 align:middle line:84%
so that if there is a
devastation of this level

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:15.600 align:middle line:84%
of reality, there are
resources and intelligence

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and personalities on the
higher levels of the cosmos

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that can act to
repopulate the Earth.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.120 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.286 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does that
work, functionally speaking,

00:42:29.286 --> 00:42:32.700 align:middle line:84%
in terms of where the bodies
come from and so forth,

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:33.810 align:middle line:90%
the vehicles?

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Well, that's--

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The cloud.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.291 align:middle line:84%
That we can start
occupying from the cloud.

00:42:37.291 --> 00:42:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: That's a very
interesting question.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:44.880 align:middle line:84%
In the Puranas, there
are some descriptions

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:49.320 align:middle line:84%
of how this takes
place, and it involves

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:54.300 align:middle line:84%
the acts of personalities
called Prajapatis.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.630 align:middle line:90%
So Prajapati is a Sanskrit word.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It means generators
of population.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking earlier
about male and female.

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So these Prajapatis
are male and female.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And by their
reproductive activities,

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:21.300 align:middle line:84%
they manifest the bodies
of the plants, the animals,

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and the human beings on
this level of reality.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:34.050 align:middle line:10%
And these Prajapatis they're
human-like in their form,

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:37.200 align:middle line:10%
but they exist on a
more subtle realm.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.690 align:middle line:10%
And there's even-- in modern
science there's something

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:48.060 align:middle line:10%
called interspecies
embryo transfer,

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:10%
where you can transfer the
embryo of an animal of one

00:43:53.580 --> 00:44:00.000 align:middle line:10%
species to the womb of an
animal of another species,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.810 align:middle line:10%
and that animal will
give birth to an animal

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:09.540 align:middle line:10%
of a different species.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that we hear

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:15.510 align:middle line:90%
about even in modern biology.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:19.320 align:middle line:10%
But apparently these
Prajapatis, these higher beings,

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.340 align:middle line:10%
they have that same
kind of ability

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:30.210 align:middle line:10%
that they are able to give
birth to plant and animal

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:35.970 align:middle line:10%
and human species that
are of a different kind

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:42.210 align:middle line:10%
than the Prajapatis
are themselves.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And then once the original
ones are manifested,

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.860 align:middle line:84%
they begin to
reproduce themselves.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's
interesting that there's

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.740 align:middle line:84%
a sexual process involving
male and female that

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:05.580 align:middle line:84%
goes on for this repopulation
of the earthly level of reality

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:11.160 align:middle line:84%
that takes place after the
devastations that occur

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.610 align:middle line:90%
at the end of each Manvantar.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
interesting parallel

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:19.170 align:middle line:90%
with modern paleontology.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Now according to
the Vedic cosmology,

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.520 align:middle line:84%
we're now in the
seventh Manvantar

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.340 align:middle line:90%
of the current Day of Brahma.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:34.920 align:middle line:84%
This Day of Brahma lasts
4,320,000,000 years.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.050 align:middle line:90%
We're about in the middle of it.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:41.650 align:middle line:84%
That means it began about
two billion years ago.

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And since that time, there have
been six Manvantars previous

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.900 align:middle line:90%
to the ones that we're in.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.640 align:middle line:90%
That means six devastations.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So they occur at intervals
of about 300 million years,

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.400 align:middle line:84%
starting about two
billion years ago.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Modern paleontology
says life began

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:11.280 align:middle line:84%
on Earth about two
billion years ago,

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.220 align:middle line:84%
between two or three billion
years ago, they would say.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And in that time,
they say there have

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:21.570 align:middle line:84%
been what they call
six major extinction

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:28.900 align:middle line:84%
events spaced at intervals of
a couple hundred million years.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:32.550 align:middle line:84%
The most recent one, the
most recent extinction event,

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.680 align:middle line:84%
according to their way
of looking at things,

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.620 align:middle line:84%
is the one that wiped
out the dinosaurs.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
some kind of parallels

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.320 align:middle line:84%
between what we find
in this ancient wisdom

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:49.830 align:middle line:84%
source, the Vedas, and what
modern science is telling us.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.980 align:middle line:84%
There have been
periodic catastrophes

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:56.457 align:middle line:84%
after which the Earth
has to be repopulated.

00:46:56.457 --> 00:46:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've always
wondered, how does that occur?

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: It's happened before
and it'll happen again.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.510 align:middle line:84%
What about when you start
adding the Sumerian texts in

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and all these different
texts, then you

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:07.790 align:middle line:84%
start adding the
Hermetic knowledge

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.450 align:middle line:90%
and the Egyptian texts.

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Each one is sharing
their piece of it,

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:15.120 align:middle line:84%
but our timelines
are all wrong here.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on Earth as we
understand it right now,

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.650 align:middle line:84%
the timelines are
simply not correct,

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, dating us back only
essentially 5,000 years,

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.860 align:middle line:84%
5,000 to 6,000 years
in our known history.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we have to
work with on a physical level.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.140 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
Sumerian story of that

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:37.980 align:middle line:84%
400,000-year period, and the
Anunnaki coming and working

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of a laboratory
type of environment to create

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:46.230 align:middle line:84%
the new hybrid species, and
how that story plays out.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
that story believes

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:52.300 align:middle line:84%
it is the only story,
that pixel of our history.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Can you comment a little
bit on that story?

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.620 align:middle line:90%


00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well,
different researchers

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:02.640 align:middle line:84%
in what we might call the
alternative history field

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.440 align:middle line:90%
are inspired by different texts.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I personally am inspired
by the Vedic texts,

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.320 align:middle line:90%
the Puranas, things like that.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Others are more interested
in the Sumerian texts,

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:20.190 align:middle line:90%
some the Egyptian texts.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:22.400 align:middle line:84%
They take those
as inspirational.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Some look to the Greek
writings about Atlantis.

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:32.080 align:middle line:84%
But I think there are common
features in all of them.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, we might have
some disagreements,

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:38.217 align:middle line:84%
but we would have
some things in common.

00:48:38.217 --> 00:48:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are the
most common touching points

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.310 align:middle line:90%
throughout?

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, the
commonalities I

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:84%
see is human life does not
exist just on this planet.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:54.560 align:middle line:84%
There are
extraterrestrial beings.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And different people
have different concepts

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:01.600 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to be
an extraterrestrial.

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Some like to cast it in
purely flesh and blood terms,

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:10.260 align:middle line:84%
whereas I have an expanded
conception of what it means

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.450 align:middle line:90%
to be an extraterrestrial.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I would accommodate the
more subtle kinds of beings

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.890 align:middle line:90%
I've been talking about.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.930 align:middle line:84%
That other people, in
terms of their traditions,

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:27.730 align:middle line:84%
might call angels or jinn
or gods or goddesses, things

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:28.530 align:middle line:90%
of that sort.

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.300 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
a common feature,

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.300 align:middle line:84%
that we're not
alone in the cosmos,

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that our human
presence on this planet

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.100 align:middle line:84%
is connected with human-like
realities on other planets,

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and we might even
say other dimensions

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:51.690 align:middle line:90%
or levels of the cosmos.

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And all of these different
wisdom traditions

00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:02.460 align:middle line:84%
tend to have a more
ancient concept of how

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.210 align:middle line:90%
long human history has gone on.

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:08.790 align:middle line:84%
You were mentioning the
Sumerian texts speaking

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:15.940 align:middle line:84%
of a time frame of 432,000
years in terms of the Babylonian

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:19.275 align:middle line:84%
and Sumerian King
lists that go back.

00:50:19.275 --> 00:50:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that's part
of the history.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.080 align:middle line:90%
But there's more to it.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Plato told of how the
Greek lawmaker Solon, who

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:39.940 align:middle line:84%
made the laws of Athens,
invented democracy and all

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:46.875 align:middle line:84%
that, he went to Egypt and he
spoke to some Egyptian priest.

00:50:46.875 --> 00:50:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
about history.

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:51.162 align:middle line:90%


00:50:51.162 --> 00:50:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [INAUDIBLE] or
whatever his name was,

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.220 align:middle line:90%
was his primary-- yes.

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I think this is in the
dialogue called the Timaeus.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:02.100 align:middle line:90%


00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were asking
him about Greek history,

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and he told the story as he
knew it from the Greek legends,

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that there was some creation,
there was a big flood,

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and then human beings were
recreated after the flood.

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:24.690 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians said that's
just part of the story,

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:28.550 align:middle line:84%
because actually there have
been many devastations,

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.264 align:middle line:84%
and you've just
got the records--

00:51:31.264 --> 00:51:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For this last bit.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: For the last bit.

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And we have the records
of all the previous ones,

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:43.140 align:middle line:90%
which go back very far in time.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So I would hope that eventually
those records would be found.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But they're consistent with
what the ancient Sanskrit

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:57.400 align:middle line:84%
writings, the Puranas,
have to say, namely

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:02.220 align:middle line:84%
that there have been
numerous devastations,

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and humans have been present
before them and they've

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.520 align:middle line:90%
been present after them.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.340 align:middle line:90%
So I think--

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone has to
make up their own minds

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:16.830 align:middle line:90%
about these things.

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But personally, I
find what's expressed

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:26.199 align:middle line:84%
in those ancient Sanskrit
writings is giving a--

00:52:26.199 --> 00:52:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It gives a framework.

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Satisfying framework
for the whole history

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.744 align:middle line:84%
of our human species
on this planet.

00:52:35.744 --> 00:52:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's why I
love talking with you, like I

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.810 align:middle line:84%
said at the very beginning,
because you can share

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:43.830 align:middle line:84%
this larger overview
in all its grace,

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and the cyclical nature
of consciousness,

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding
we're not a slave

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:49.740 align:middle line:90%
to any one of these things.

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:51.720 align:middle line:84%
As you say, you
don't have to get wet

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.250 align:middle line:90%
just because it's raining.

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And I really like the higher
view that you carry with you

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and you bring to us as a result
of your lifetime of studies

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:02.970 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge.

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And you seem like
an avatar to me.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But in any event,
what I'm also loving

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.430 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that science
is being woven into it,

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and you've certainly done
your due diligence there.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're just
beginning to discover

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:20.040 align:middle line:84%
the antiquity of what's
already been here in terms

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.200 align:middle line:90%
of days of high consciousness.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:27.080 align:middle line:84%
In the Hermetics,
according to the Hermetics,

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.030 align:middle line:84%
the society of Egypt is a couple
hundred thousand years old,

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:34.170 align:middle line:84%
not 5,000 or even 10,000,
but at least 200,000.

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid,
85,000 years old.

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:44.340 align:middle line:84%
If we can start getting our
minds around the antiquity

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.580 align:middle line:84%
of this, and everything
under 20 feet of silt that's

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.580 align:middle line:84%
being discovered with new
technology, we can begin,

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I think, moving more toward
what the Vedas and some

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:57.180 align:middle line:84%
of these other ancient texts,
but particularly the Vedas,

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.610 align:middle line:90%
have been describing all along.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And so on that note,
how do you feel about us

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.070 align:middle line:84%
as the human species on
this planet right now

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and what you're seeing
by way of our progress?

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:12.030 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, in
this little cycle.

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, for me,
it's important to keep

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:18.540 align:middle line:84%
in mind that we're
all extraterrestrial.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I agree.

00:54:20.535 --> 00:54:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: In the sense that
the conscious self is not

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:28.574 align:middle line:90%
from this world of matter.

00:54:28.574 --> 00:54:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This domain.

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: The
conscious self comes

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:34.620 align:middle line:84%
from another domain, the
domain of pure consciousness,

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.920 align:middle line:84%
or Brahma, the spiritual
world, whatever name you

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.680 align:middle line:90%
want to attach to it.

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think in terms
of individuals,

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.420 align:middle line:84%
I think there are many
individuals of all parts

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:56.040 align:middle line:84%
of the world who are coming
to that understanding,

00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:02.646 align:middle line:84%
although the institutions, the
political, financial, cultural,

00:55:02.646 --> 00:55:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and educational
institutions are all

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:11.400 align:middle line:90%
organized on a different basis.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:16.930 align:middle line:84%
They're promoting the idea, in
these educational institutions,

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that we're just machines made of
matter, as Richard Dawkins once

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:24.090 align:middle line:90%
said.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:28.110 align:middle line:84%
We are survival machines,
robot vehicles blindly

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:31.950 align:middle line:84%
programmed to preserve the
selfish molecules known

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:33.450 align:middle line:90%
as genes.

00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:35.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you have
an attitude like that,

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:39.420 align:middle line:84%
if that's what your
sense of identity is,

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm a machine made of
molecules in competition

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:48.540 align:middle line:84%
with other machines made of
molecules, then your goals

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and your values
and your objectives

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.720 align:middle line:90%
are going to reflect that.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.655 align:middle line:84%
You're going to think that
to produce and consume

00:55:56.655 --> 00:56:01.410 align:middle line:84%
more and more and of material
things in competing groups

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:04.890 align:middle line:84%
is the main purpose
of human life.

00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
confronted with problems.

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:10.680 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
finding yourself

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:16.350 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of unparalleled
environmental destruction.

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find yourself
confronted with conflict

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:24.870 align:middle line:84%
on every level of human
society among individuals,

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:30.700 align:middle line:84%
among classes, among
nations, among religions.

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:38.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not a very productive
kind of identification.

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But through the
education system and

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:46.050 align:middle line:84%
the scientific institutions,
that kind of material, purely

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:50.340 align:middle line:84%
material identification
is being--

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reinforced to the max.

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Forced and
reinforced on people.

00:56:54.810 --> 00:57:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And there are huge financial,
political, cultural, social,

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:05.490 align:middle line:84%
educational, and
religious institutions

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:11.580 align:middle line:84%
that are founded on what I
regard as a mistaken concept

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:13.710 align:middle line:90%
of identity.

00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:19.110 align:middle line:84%
The fortunate thing is that
many people, increasing numbers

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:23.430 align:middle line:84%
of people all over the
world, somehow or other

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:27.410 align:middle line:84%
are coming to a different
understanding of who they are

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and where they should be
going, despite the influence

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:39.840 align:middle line:84%
of these institutional
manifestations of the mentality

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.710 align:middle line:90%
I was just describing.

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:middle line:90%
So that's hopeful.

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is hopeful.

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Just a quick question, because
we're just about out of time.

00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it is some
of those darker forces

00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that are perpetually
reinforcing these institutions

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:57.270 align:middle line:90%
and programs on this planet?

00:57:57.270 --> 00:58:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Yes, and
I think that's part

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:06.720 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to be in
the midst of the Kali Yuga,

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:13.380 align:middle line:84%
because it is a time
when such influences are

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:17.470 align:middle line:90%
prominent in human society.

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:19.340 align:middle line:84%
As you go through
the cycle of Yugas,

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:23.010 align:middle line:84%
there's a progressive
degradation

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:28.730 align:middle line:84%
of human society in terms of its
values, goals, and objectives.

00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And that may be because those
with sufficient awareness

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
are transcending out

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:45.080 align:middle line:84%
so that what's left
in the Kali Yuga

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:51.180 align:middle line:84%
is those who are holding
on to these ideas.

00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Still, there's always the
chance for any individual to--

00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:59.610 align:middle line:84%
by exercising their own
intelligence and use

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:04.590 align:middle line:84%
of free will, and
following their intuition

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:06.510 align:middle line:90%
wherever it leads them--

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:08.920 align:middle line:84%
there's the chance
to get out of that.

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:13.200 align:middle line:84%
But the trend is
definitely towards that.

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And it will end at
a certain point.

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:20.570 align:middle line:84%
According to the Vedic
cosmological calendar,

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:25.720 align:middle line:84%
the Kali Yuga started
5,000 years ago.

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:31.400 align:middle line:90%
It will go on for 427,000 years.

00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:38.060 align:middle line:10%
But those same writings tell
us that the period we're in now

00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:39.740 align:middle line:10%
is like--

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:42.200 align:middle line:10%
it's just like when
winter is coming on,

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:46.160 align:middle line:10%
sometimes you get
a few warm days.

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.130 align:middle line:10%
So we're in one of
those periods now,

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:53.310 align:middle line:10%
where it's possible for
there to be a Golden Age even

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.090 align:middle line:10%
in the midst of Kali Yuga.

00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:58.370 align:middle line:84%
It all depends upon
the choices that we

00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:00.850 align:middle line:90%
each make as individuals.

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note, I
couldn't have you add anything

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:05.390 align:middle line:90%
better than that.

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:09.445 align:middle line:84%
It is really down to our choice
and our use of our free will,

01:00:09.445 --> 01:00:10.245 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:00:10.245 --> 01:00:10.690 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Absolutely.
