>>BLU: The doctor swiveled
around on his chair

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and looked at me and
he says, your results

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.050 align:middle line:90%
are actually very concerning.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.950 align:middle line:84%
You have the hearing results
of about of an 80-year-old.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
The words have become quieter
recognizing that energy doesn't

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:90%
lie, words do all the time.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.080 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading
that gene key,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and it genuinely felt like my
DNA was restructuring itself

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:90%
in real time.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
When I put the hearing
aids in, it's so jarring.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Apparently it takes three weeks
to adjust to hearing aids.

And welcome, Blu.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.588 align:middle line:90%
So good to meet you.

00:01:26.588 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Thank you so much.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Such an honor to
be here with you.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to be talking

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:84%
about all of this,
your personal journey,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
going to be really,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I think, the first one
introducing my audience

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:90%
to "The Gene Keys."

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And just so they know
the founder, the one who

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
created "The Gene Keys," Richard
Rudd, who you and I both know,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:90%
will be coming here also.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is a wonderful
entree for the audience

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
to tap into just one or two keys
that really can affect everyone

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:90%
in which you and I share.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want
to say to everyone

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:84%
we have a little dog,
your little service dog.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Lilly is on your lap.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever see a
little-- you a little

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:84%
tuft poke up right here, it's
a little service dog, Lilly.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:90%
She's a sweetie pie.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:10%
So first of all,
let's talk about what

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:10%
happened in your life where
you began to physically use

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:10%
your sense of hearing and
you and your brother both

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:10%
and what your life was
like prior to that,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:10%
and then what started unfolding.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:10%
>>BLU: So like you said,
I wasn't born with this.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:10%
This was something that
was new into my world.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.940 align:middle line:10%
And how I started
noticing it is actually

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.593 align:middle line:10%
I realized that when the
hearing starts decrease,

00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:39.260 align:middle line:10%
it's actually not me
that's noticing it.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
It's those that are
around me that notices it.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my ignorance, just bliss.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I started noticing
these comments of, all right,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:84%
come on, Blu, clean
your ears out.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't you paying attention?

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.492 align:middle line:10%
Or you're not responding
when I'm looking at you?

00:02:52.492 --> 00:02:54.387 align:middle line:84%
And so it was in those
moments of reflections

00:02:54.387 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:84%
was when it was
starting to be brought

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.143 align:middle line:90%
into my field of awareness.

00:02:58.143 --> 00:03:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you really weren't
noticing that the world is

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:90%
becoming more quiet.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: It started
becoming muffled

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
a little bit but not to the
point that was concerning.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I was actually

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.590 align:middle line:84%
having lunch with my family,
and my brother was also there.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.415 align:middle line:84%
And he mentioned-- he'd say, mom
my hearing starting to become

00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
muffled, and I'm getting
a lot of reflections

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:84%
from people saying that
I'm not paying attention.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:84%
That was then what sparked my
realization that I was also

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:90%
experiencing the same thing.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So still at this point
it's very innocent.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the
doctor, and we both

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:90%
had our hearing checked.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.518 align:middle line:84%
And I'll remember that moment
for the rest of my life

00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:36.890 align:middle line:84%
is happened in slow-mo when
the doctor swiveled around

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:84%
on his chair and put his glasses
from the bridge of my nose up

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:90%
and looked at me.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And he says, your results
are actually very concerning.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:84%
You have the hearing results
of about of an 80-year-old.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.163 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in my mid
20s at this point.

00:03:48.163 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well,
we won't really

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:10%
understand what is
actually happening

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.162 align:middle line:10%
until extensive testing over
a prolonged period of time

00:03:53.162 --> 00:03:54.872 align:middle line:10%
to see if it's getting worse.

00:03:54.872 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
However, what I can say is
that your brother also has

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:90%
very similar shocking results.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.472 align:middle line:84%
And so it's most likely
to be hereditary.

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How old was
your brother at the time?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: My brother is
three years older than me.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so his late 20s.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.228 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So he's still in his
late 20s, yeah, late 20s.

00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my mid 20s at this point.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:90%
And so we go home.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is quite jarring
for my mother and our family.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And so over the next
six months, we're

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:84%
going and testing
every single month

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
to just continue to check
the hearing as is unraveling

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And during that
time, that's when

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
it started coming into
my conscious awareness.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:10%
So I started noticing
it more and more

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.378 align:middle line:10%
that I was in social
settings, and I

00:04:31.378 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:10%
would experience this
new phenomenon, which

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:10%
was social anxiety.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.687 align:middle line:10%
I would be in a
group conversation,

00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:10%
and someone would
say something and it

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:10%
would ping across the
other side of the room

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:10%
to someone else
saying something,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:10%
and all of a sudden I have
no idea what's going on.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's laughing
at some joke.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I feel very alone in the space.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And it started progressing
to the point where I actually

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to be out
in public anymore.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the diagnosis over
a prolonged period of time

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.580 align:middle line:84%
was that it's
progressive, meaning

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:90%
that it's getting worse.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
It's hereditary,
meaning that it's

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
potentially came from a
genetic within our family.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.277 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is
it normal that it

00:05:02.277 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
would have a late onset like
that, this particular kind

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:90%
of deafness?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.358 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: They couldn't
really give it

00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
a diagnosis in the sense
of what was causing it.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really understand
fully the extent of the genetic

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:90%
or what was really happening.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't really
know the trajectory

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:90%
of where it was going.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a lot of
big question marks placed

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
on such a massive
piece to be integrated

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:90%
in my early 20s or mid 20s.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a wild
journey since then

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
of learning how to navigate the
world with one sense starting

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:84%
to significantly
become decreased

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
over time, my brother
also navigating

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.170 align:middle line:90%
in his own unique way.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in each of your
cases, how-- to what percentage

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:90%
was your hearing decreased?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: We're at about
70% both of us deafness.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have about 30%
hearing in both our ears

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.722 align:middle line:90%
left at this point.

00:05:57.722 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
that block out?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what do you
simply not hear in the spectrum?

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So I'm completely
deaf on my high tones.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So, for example,
do we get in the car

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and the car is like, beep, beep,
beep, put on your seat belt.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear that.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
My dog crying at a really
high pitch like whining,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear that.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
There's certain frequencies
that just completely go over

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:90%
my head.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm above average
on my low tones.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, a woman's
voice in a public space--

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:84%
the low tone is the
background noise,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.195 align:middle line:84%
the high tone is
the woman's voice.

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden
the woman's voice

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:90%
now sounds like (HUMMING).

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.210 align:middle line:84%
A man's voice in
the same situation I

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
may hear better because
it's operating more

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:90%
on the lower tones.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So it was such an
interesting new terrain

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
for me to learn to navigate
how frequencies work

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and that there are constant
frequencies operating

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.830 align:middle line:84%
all around us, and it
depends on what frame I'm in,

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.426 align:middle line:84%
depends on how much I'm hearing
and what I'm picking up on.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you get the
news this is progressive.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, has it been progressive?

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.250 align:middle line:10%
Or did it stop around 70%?

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:10%
Or you don't know yet?

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: It started to
become progressive,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, my inquiry
around a deeper meaning of life

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and subscribing to the
belief that I can heal myself

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
from anything and
asking why did I create

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
this in the first place
therefore giving myself

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:84%
the ownership of being
able to actually shift it

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
has massively catalyzed
my spiritual growth

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and my understanding on my inner
workings and my inner world.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And so as the diagnosis
was presented,

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:84%
so was the parallel
path of wanting

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to know myself not
from the outside

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:84%
in of what the world expects
from me but from the inside

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:84%
out, ask deeper questions that
allows me to actually become

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
the creator of my
own experience,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:84%
not the victim of
my circumstances.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that actually
has slowed or maybe even

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.765 align:middle line:90%
stopped the progression?

00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:09.565 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Yes.

00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:10.398 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And to an extent
of also recognizing

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that realizing in this realm
where the words have become

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:84%
quieter, recognizing
that energy doesn't lie,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:90%
words do all the time.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And so what
it was doing--

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and Albert Einstein
talks about how

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:84%
energy is not created nor
destroyed only changed in form.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.799 align:middle line:84%
So when the sense or the energy
that was going towards hearing

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:84%
has now just been redirected
to the extrasensory perception

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:90%
of feeling.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
When you sit in
front of somebody

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel somebody,
you can feel that essence.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
You can feel what it is
that they may be thinking.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's based off of how
the body on a somatic level

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:90%
receives it.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So what I was starting
to open up the door to

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:90%
was the realm of feeling that--

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes perfect sense.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: --hasn't had a massive
emphasis on growing up.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that as
I started to recognize

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that this could be
actually a gift,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:84%
that was when it seemed
to stop in its tracks.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So as we're talking right
now, you're reading my lips,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:90%
and I have a fairly soft voice.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you hear much
of my voice at all?

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I hear your voice
to a certain degree,

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and I'm matching your voice
with what your lips are saying.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And also on top of that,
I'm reading an energy.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing your eye contact.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling the
shifts in your body.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of communication,
a very high percentage

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:84%
of communication that's
actually nonverbal.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And because we're so
reliant on our five senses,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that we don't give ourselves the
gift of really actually tapping

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
into the non-sensory
realm, which

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:84%
is actually operating
24/7 at all times.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.910 align:middle line:84%
OK so at what point--
was there ever

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
a point where it was
discussed that maybe you

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:90%
should learn signing?

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Or did you not need to
because you had already

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:84%
developed the ability to read
lips and hear to an extent?

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.315 align:middle line:90%
Did signing ever come into it?

00:10:00.315 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Sign language
is something

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:84%
that I would absolutely
adore to get into.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:90%
I haven't gone into it yet.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:84%
More so my main focus
has been on adjusting

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle line:84%
with such adaptable
human beings.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Adjusting my current
way of processing information

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:84%
in a way that allows
me to still be

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
able to retain as much, if not
more, information, remain fully

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
present, receive the
gift of who you are,

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.410 align:middle line:84%
while also allowing
myself to not miss out

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
on anything that is
happening in my world.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And, dot, dot,
dot, to be continued,

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.097 align:middle line:84%
would love to learn sign
language at some point.

00:10:33.097 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing I can't
be the only one that

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.030 align:middle line:84%
learns sign language, I got
to bring my friend in with me,

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
otherwise I'd be
the only one having

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.260 align:middle line:84%
a conversation with me, myself,
and I. So it's a mutual thing.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.802 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, so do
your friends ever

00:10:42.802 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:10%
use you at a social gathering,
say, what are they saying?

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Read lips.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Well, I'm--

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Has that ever happened
where someone says, come here,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:90%
come here.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:90%
What are they saying?

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of
cheating, but do they?

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.027 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Not so much
about reading the lips

00:10:57.027 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
but more so about what's
your read on this person.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So it's like, hey,
Blu, come on in here.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: What's your read?

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And what's your
extrasensory energy

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:90%
picking up on this individual?

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like having
a sniffer dog in this space

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.360 align:middle line:84%
but in human form, and (SNIFFS)
Yeah, they're pretty cool.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, very cool.

00:11:12.855 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we start
going into the story

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.440 align:middle line:90%
that I mentioned in the open.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Having to do with part of
this transformation process,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.870 align:middle line:84%
along the way you
encountered the gene keys.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So let me just set up very
briefly, Richard Rudd, who

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I've had people ask me for
years and years to interview,

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I keep hearing-- he seems so
beloved, but I didn't know him.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know about
the basic architecture

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
before "Gene Keys"
called "Human Design."

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
well aware of that.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So I just hadn't been
pressed into learning more.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we're talking about
a very elegant system,

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:56.110 align:middle line:84%
both human design and a great
structure architecture, which

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
he was a devotee
of many years ago,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and then he had
his own downloads.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
"The Gene Keys"
were birthed, which

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:84%
is a very, very poetic,
sophisticated, profound means

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.080 align:middle line:90%
of understanding ourselves.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And so you came in contact
with "The Gene Key."

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:90%
So now you share your story.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So I--
after my diagnosis,

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
decided to book a one-way ticket
and go and experience life

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:84%
because tomorrow
wasn't going to.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I bought myself a
guitar, and I was

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
adamant about learning how
to play and to sing because I

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
didn't know if I was going to be
able to hear my own voice again

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.037 align:middle line:90%
or hear music.

00:12:32.037 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:90%
So nothing was guaranteed.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.658 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to go
traveling around the world.

00:12:35.658 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And I took this guitar with
me and learned a few chords

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and started singing and feeling
the vibration of my voice.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being in a
space that my friends pushed

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:84%
across the table
this giant book.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.185 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's hefty.

00:12:47.185 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But "The
Gene Keys" book is--

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.093 align:middle line:90%
it's a tome.

00:12:50.093 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: It's already off-putting
for a lot of people.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:90%
They're like, that's a lot.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:90%
No, thanks.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I think you'd
really appreciate this book.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Now, I opened it up.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And at that time
in my life, I just

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:84%
was not a vibrational
match to the information.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Here comes Lilly, surprise!

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here she is.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I was not a vibrational
match to the information.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I had it on my
shelf, but I didn't dive

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:90%
into it for a while afterwards.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And then there was one
moment where I was like, OK,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:84%
this is the time I'm going
to get into this book.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And now once I actually
started to realize

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and deeper level
of understanding

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:84%
of what "The Gene Keys" is,
it's so much more than a book.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: It's a living
transmission that you

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle line:90%
can never really exhaust.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And it is a code
book of consciousness

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:84%
to understand oneself
and understand

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.580 align:middle line:84%
that our greatest challenge
holds the seed of our greatest

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:90%
gift.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, at my dismay, I was
going through the book

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.242 align:middle line:84%
and realized that I had
this gene key of deafness.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We were
going to dive way

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.070 align:middle line:90%
into that for all of our sakes.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: When I saw that word,
and while I was processing

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
the curriculum that life had
presented me with my hearing,

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading
that gene key,

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and it genuinely felt like my
DNA was restructuring itself

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:90%
in real time.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like a psychedelic
altered state of consciousness

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that left knee in a
place of speechless

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:90%
and timelessness and pure awe.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:84%
I remember that day
in that moment--

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and I will remember it
for the rest of my life--

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.950 align:middle line:84%
just sitting in my little
cabin in the forest crying with

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:84%
the potential that my
deafness actually wasn't--

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was a gift.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: It was a gift.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:90%
I had been gifted it.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And also recognizing that the
overarching theme of "The Gene

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Keys" is that everybody is dealt
certain cards in this life that

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:84%
are challenging,
that are painful,

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:84%
that are discombobulating,
that leave us on our knees

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:90%
questioning why.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And right within
that challenge also

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:84%
holds the seed of
our greatest gift

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and are ultimately our
service to the whole.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe not everybody
relates to the deafness.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
However, I'm sure everybody
can relate to a challenge.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
understood that actually

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:84%
in "The Gene Keys" there's
the challenge, the shadow,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:90%
there's also the gift.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
highest expression,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
there's this CD,
which is essentially

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:84%
the enlightened aspect
where maximum out of light

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:90%
is entering our DNA.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are vibrational
beings, and ultimately it's

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
never ending inwards, and
it's never ending externally,

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
meaning that we have around 75
trillion cells in the body that

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:90%
are vibrating.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately
they have two jobs.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Really what it comes
down is to listen

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and to respond to the story,
60,000 thoughts we think a day,

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:90%
on average.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:84%
The cells are listening
and responding

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:84%
to whatever we are
telling ourselves

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and how far our imagination
is willing to go.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.055 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And so if I could
only be limited to, oh,

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:84%
all this is just the worst
thing that could happen to me,

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:90%
and this is super sad--

00:15:58.810 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: --then my cells are
listening and going, OK,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:90%
then that's the truth of it.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to dive
into that key number

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:84%
43 that has deafness,
epiphany, insight

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:15.550 align:middle line:84%
because every one of the
keys starts with the shadow.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.040 align:middle line:90%
And so Richard really gives--

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I think, "Gene Keys," the
work, gives people permission

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to look at the shadow
and to allow themselves

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
to take in what there is to
gain from that because then it

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:84%
guides you right on through
to the gift of each one.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very complete way of
acknowledging one's full self.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just tell a
little experience.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:84%
About a year ago, I think
there were three of us.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:90%
I was here in Boulder.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of
girlfriends were with me.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.372 align:middle line:84%
And we all got our profiles,
our gene key profiles,

00:16:47.372 --> 00:16:49.330 align:middle line:84%
which anyone can go to
genekeys.com and pull up

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:90%
their free profile.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:84%
We pulled up our profiles, and
we had the book-- the big book.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And what I found so fascinating
was that in the case of women--

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know that this
would be the same way with men--

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
the women were happy to
acknowledge and accept

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.369 align:middle line:84%
their shadows but had a
much more difficult time

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:90%
accepting their gift.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.079 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And so having each other read
together and study it together

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:84%
gave us an opportunity
to validate the beauty

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.850 align:middle line:84%
in each other that oftentimes
women are shut down

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:90%
from seeing.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Just because of
the patriarchy, we

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
have learned to
minimize our value.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching it in action
and thought this is amazing.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.340 align:middle line:84%
It's so beautiful that we can
validate each other and say,

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.450 align:middle line:84%
absolutely you
have that strength.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:90%
That is your gift.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's lovely to do in
group, not just individually.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:49.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I love that you
said that because it really

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.610 align:middle line:84%
gave me a new definition of
what it means to hold space.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe that truly
means is that when somebody is

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:84%
in their shadow, A.K.A. a
negative thought pattern,

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:84%
a belief system that is an
illusion that is a couple

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.730 align:middle line:84%
of degrees away from
who they truly are,

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.930 align:middle line:84%
when we can witness somebody
that is present within that

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:84%
narrative and to hold also in
the same breath the potential--

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: --that they can live
into and seeing their potential

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and loving their potential
and knowing their potential,

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that is the opportunity
to catalyze them

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.400 align:middle line:84%
into their greatness
because to truly see someone

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:90%
in the entirety of their--

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: --being is
the greatest gift.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It gives
language for it.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And it gives poetic,
beautiful language

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.710 align:middle line:90%
for it and truthful language.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:90%
You can't really escape.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I first read
my profile, I thought, oh,

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:90%
my God, just this little four--

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:84%
the four primary
areas of your life

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
that it illustrates
in a paragraph or two,

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought, jeez, I do need
to interview this man.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:90%
So I am.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.240 align:middle line:84%
He's coming in a
couple of months time.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.225 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, but he
has great respect

00:18:58.225 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:84%
for what you've done with
it, by the way, because I

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.430 align:middle line:90%
spoke to him about it.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said you're really
magnificent in interpretation.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And I understand you help
other people understand

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:90%
that you read.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.530 align:middle line:84%
You help them read
their gene keys

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and embrace and
understand the knowledge.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: It is true.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So after I went
through my whole chart

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and just had this massive
activation around it--

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.347 align:middle line:84%
when I believe in
something-- it's

00:19:19.347 --> 00:19:21.097 align:middle line:84%
called heart marketing
in "The Gene Keys."

00:19:21.097 --> 00:19:22.610 align:middle line:84%
When I believe in
something, I want

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:23.705 align:middle line:90%
to shout it from the rooftops.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Oh my gosh,
this is brilliant.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Everybody gets to
have a gene key book--

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No wonder
Richard loves you so much.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.902 align:middle line:90%
You're the roof crier.

00:19:33.902 --> 00:19:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And so I just started
reading my friends gene.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Just like you did.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:84%
You brought it your sisters,
and you just went into it.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was just coming and being
born from a natural curiosity.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And then it just organically
started to unravel to the point

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.195 align:middle line:84%
where I actually decoded
the entire book--

00:19:49.195 --> 00:19:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Jeez,
that's something.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: --every single gene
key in my own note form.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And what it did is
it changed my lens

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.840 align:middle line:84%
on perceiving reality
based off of archetypes

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
of recognizing that our greatest
challenge is our greatest gift.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a shadow,
and there's a gift.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's a city to
everything, the sweet polarity

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:90%
and the paradox of being alive.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And it changed my way of
processing challenging times.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.685 align:middle line:90%
It allowed me to soften more.

00:20:15.685 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
It allowed me to recognize
that the more I actually

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:84%
soften as opposed to hardened
against times of resistance

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
is actually when the upgrade,
the insight, the light

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:90%
could enter into the cracks.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And so also when I was doing the
readings, what I was doing was

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I was partnering my ability
to feel somebody based off

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:84%
of my hearing and
the gift that was

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:90%
presented through my hearing.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.160 align:middle line:84%
While partnering it
with that gene key chart

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and reading the
holo-genetic profile,

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
then feeling what's going on in
the individual, what I would do

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.450 align:middle line:84%
is I would partner the
information together,

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and then reflect the beauty
that I saw in that individual.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the greatest
gift we can give to somebody

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:84%
is to listen intently,
ask great questions,

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and reflect the
beauty that you see.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.445 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:58.445 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go into
that little pesky

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
key that happens to
be my top key as well.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Your life's work.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My life's work, which
is deafness through epiphany

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:90%
insights.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: So insight again--

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Insight--

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: --and then epiphany.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and epiphany as yes.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.565 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that in terms of you

00:21:16.565 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:84%
went through it
quite literally to go

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:90%
through this transformation.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:84%
But many, many, many
people watching this

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:27.080 align:middle line:84%
have 43 gene key in there
somewhere, this deafness.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And so for myself
I noticed that,

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and relatively recently,
where I have allowed

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:40.690 align:middle line:90%
myself to live in happy--

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'd go so
far as saying delusions.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:84%
But when you're ignoring
something in depth

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:84%
to something, it almost does
create a type of delusion.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:84%
When you have a happy,
little scenario,

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:84%
a story in your head where
everything's wonderful,

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.210 align:middle line:84%
the happily ever
after kinds of stories

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.580 align:middle line:84%
we tell ourselves in life,
and we're not actually-- we're

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:06.300 align:middle line:84%
deaf to the signs that are
literally all around us.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
deafness in that sense,

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.200 align:middle line:84%
which is where I have
certainly had to deal with it

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and where many people
listening deal with it,

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:84%
deaf to the inside messages
because even you'll even

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:90%
hear them and say, oh, no.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.512 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Yeah, it's confirmation
bias around the stories

00:22:23.512 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:90%
that we tell ourselves.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Well, this
is my narrative,

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:90%
and this is what works for me.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to put those
blinders at horses where that

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:84%
actually stop us from being
able to really fully understand

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.160 align:middle line:84%
all 360 of the experience
that's been presented.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It's also a deafness towards
our own internal truth

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
of what really actually
lights us up from the inside.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: From the moment that
we're born, we're told a name,

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and we're given a religion
and a social background.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And we've been given these
labels of who we think

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:90%
that we are supposed to be.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we're also told what
success is based off of what

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:90%
society deems as successful.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we mold ourselves to
these versions of ourselves

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:84%
that we think will be
deemed as is acceptable,

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and then actually realizing
that what's happened

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:84%
is we're listening to the world
to listening to ourselves.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a deafness
to be able to actually hear

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:90%
what is going on outside.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.580 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
noise in the world.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.060 align:middle line:90%
There's so much noise.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There is.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Even just
before this interview,

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.115 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of people
and things going on--

00:23:26.115 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know, swirling.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.697 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: --for us to actually
sit down and get quiet,

00:23:29.697 --> 00:23:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and then to be able to find that
common thread between the two

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And so like you
said, you don't have

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.890 align:middle line:84%
to have a physical deafness
to have the deafness gene key

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.255 align:middle line:84%
nor do you even need to
have the deafness gene

00:23:39.255 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:90%
key in your chart.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My life's
purpose is the first gene

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.440 align:middle line:90%
key in deafness is the shadow.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:90%
And I listen for a living.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.050 align:middle line:10%
>>BLU: And it's also--
it is your superpower

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:10%
because before I even
came on this interview,

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.540 align:middle line:10%
the reflections I had about
who it was that you were

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:10%
is that you ask brilliant
questions because

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.490 align:middle line:10%
of your ability
to listen to that

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:10%
which is needed to bring forward
the gold in the interview.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.260 align:middle line:84%
So as much as we may oscillate
into the shadow of being

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.110 align:middle line:84%
happy in my own story and
not really actually hearing

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:84%
what is going on in
the world, you also

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:84%
have a great gift
within that same shadow.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.010 align:middle line:90%
And so the shadow is the seed.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not fully actualized yet.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
flower, which is the gift.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
seedy, which is the fruit.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of judging
ourselves for, oh,

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed, this is just
you coming from a deep level

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:90%
of self-awareness.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:84%
You're recognizing actually
that, oh, because I've actually

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:90%
read the shadows--

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I ignored
what I heard.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Exactly.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:84%
You started to pull it forward
into your conscious awareness.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:84%
You're now pulling it forward
into your awareness and going,

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, oh, this is the
art of contemplation.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Oh, I see
it showing up here.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, here it shows up, too.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and now this
is what it means

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:90%
to turn knowledge into wisdom.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: You implement it.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's move through
then into the gift of it

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.520 align:middle line:84%
because people that have-- many,
many people watching have this.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's move into
the gift that follows.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Insight, the ability
to actually hear the whispers

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
of your own heart, the ability
to hear what it that is being

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:84%
asked of you outside of from
inside with your relationship

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.220 align:middle line:84%
with that cannot be named as
opposed to what is expected

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
from you from the noise
of the outside world,

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:84%
the regurgitation of
everybody's thought process.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Pure originality is
born in the silence

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:90%
of being able to truly listen.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And so there's hearing,
and there's listening.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
layers to the deafness

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of recognizing actually to a
certain degree a lot of people

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:39.593 align:middle line:90%
are deaf.

00:25:39.593 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
reason I bring it up

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:44.670 align:middle line:84%
is this, some time ago I
heard myself saying this.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Someone was going
on about something.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said the bottom
line in the world today

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
is everybody's talking,
and nobody's listening.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.903 align:middle line:90%
And I find that a true state--

00:25:57.903 --> 00:25:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I found it to be
a true statement.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.710 align:middle line:84%
After it came out of my mouth
I thought, why did I say that?

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that is what
I witnessed because everybody

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.090 align:middle line:90%
has so much anxiety now.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of it has to
do with media and social media,

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:84%
to be seen, to be known,
to be acknowledged.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Then there's so much
more opportunity

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:84%
for so many more eyeballs to
come on to a person because

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:84%
of technology that everything
is about projecting, projecting,

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:90%
projecting more than receiving.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I noticed
that was almost a--

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.820 align:middle line:90%
how do I say?

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:84%
It was like an attempt
to hang on to whatever

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.870 align:middle line:84%
identity people have
of themselves to keep

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
sharing, sharing,
sharing, sharing, talking.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So if they stop talking,
they'd lose the thread

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:90%
to who they are.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.845 align:middle line:90%
And I see that a lot now that.

00:26:50.845 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
That in the last 10
years that has radically

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:84%
changed the world because
everyone's talking,

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.660 align:middle line:90%
but no one's listening.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And the fact
that you can see it

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.310 align:middle line:84%
is the very piece in where
your service is born from,

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that which
is needed on the planet.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And so your lenses have become
sensitive to that very unique

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:84%
piece where you can actually
use your life's work

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.688 align:middle line:84%
to recognize a deep level
of listening actually

00:27:14.688 --> 00:27:15.980 align:middle line:90%
extract the best out of people.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
was born to do that.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Which is
what you're doing.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
that's what I do.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:19.998 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm very lucky.

00:27:19.998 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm aligned with my purpose
and make a living at it.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.400 align:middle line:84%
That's an unusual
position to be in.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm deeply
grateful for that.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.820 align:middle line:90%
So the 43, we've just examined.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted everyone
to be able to look

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.290 align:middle line:84%
at their own piece in a
society where we are all

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:90%
talking over each other.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And that means we're not
listening to each other.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the depth of what can be
had by way of listening, to me,

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.618 align:middle line:90%
is the gold of life.

00:27:46.618 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:84%
That's where we start having
our epiphanies and our insights.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's gene key number 43,
which you and I both share.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:84%
That's in my case,
my life's purpose.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:55.800 align:middle line:90%
And in your case it's what?

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: It's in my pearl.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:84%
It's my programming
partner and my pearl.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It's such a huge
part of my brand.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: A deep
level of listening.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:90%
I have a podcast.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:84%
I have a show, so it's like
listening to the guests.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And the piece and
the significant shift

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:84%
is to listening to understand
as opposed to listen to respond.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: And it hits different.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.442 align:middle line:90%
I want to understand you.

00:28:15.442 --> 00:28:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, totally,
totally different.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And then the
richness of the responses

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.920 align:middle line:84%
come from a deep level of
heart as opposed to the mind.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.810 align:middle line:84%
We were talking off
camera and I thought

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:84%
we can all ignore aspects
of self that are just

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.945 align:middle line:90%
maybe a little bit heavier.

00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't really want
to get-- we're not

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.670 align:middle line:84%
ready to unpack at the
moment or something

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.500 align:middle line:84%
or then there's just
something-- and I'm

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:90%
going to ask you about this.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.310 align:middle line:90%
You have used hearing aids.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching a show
on a cochlear implant.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And the woman
wanted it reversed.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.710 align:middle line:84%
She could not stand
what the world

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:84%
was once she was hearing
all of this noise

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:90%
that we're now referring to.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a noisy place out there.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So in your case,
what happened to you

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:03.500 align:middle line:84%
when you start dialing
back into all that noise.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: When I put the hearing
aids in, it so jarring.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Apparently it takes three weeks
to adjust to hearing aids.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.350 align:middle line:90%
As it's almost like metallic.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.192 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Metal grinding.

00:29:15.192 --> 00:29:15.992 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Yeah.

00:29:15.992 --> 00:29:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And noises that I would
never hear before,

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.820 align:middle line:84%
which is like the spoon
on the bottom of a bowl.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be in the other
room and I'm like, ow.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.155 align:middle line:90%
It was really jarring.

00:29:25.155 --> 00:29:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And it served its
purpose in a sense

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.538 align:middle line:84%
of if I'm in a group
sharing circle,

00:29:29.538 --> 00:29:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and somebody is talking,
and I just need to hear,

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I just need a little
bit of assistance.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll put them in.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.560 align:middle line:84%
However, for me right now,
my relationship with them

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm training myself
to hear beyond my ears.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And I actually
got into music for that--

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:84%
for many reasons, one being that
I am learning to feel music as

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.440 align:middle line:90%
opposed to hear it.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And Beethoven was
100% deaf and made

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.510 align:middle line:84%
music that lasted long after
his life because his ability--

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is still
hard to get our minds

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:90%
around that could be, yes.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So you're developing
that extra sense.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I'm strengthening
that extra sense.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And also my life's work
or part of my life's work

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:13.370 align:middle line:84%
is to invite others
to strengthen that

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:84%
even if your hearing
isn't going anywhere.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.290 align:middle line:84%
It's to recognize
we don't strengthen

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:84%
the muscle of our extrasensory
as much as we can.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And it can be such an
incredible ally in this life.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And when we were off
camera, I said my corollary

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:90%
to that is my sight.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I have very poor vision.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like on a scale of 20, 20.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:90%
It's 20, 4, 50, 4, 75.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.940 align:middle line:90%
It's like double legally blind.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.620 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't put my eyes in normal--

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I have to come here
because I can't see

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.530 align:middle line:90%
my script, or you, or anything.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:84%
But at home, I don't put
my eyes in, my contacts in,

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:84%
until I'm ready to
leave the house.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And I thought Renoir
had vision problems.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why his paintings
are so fuzzy and soft.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.528 align:middle line:84%
And in the day, I
think it's easy to--

00:31:00.528 --> 00:31:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that's all they were--
some of the impressionists

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.850 align:middle line:84%
were able to see because
they had poor vision as well.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my world looks
like, very sophomore Monet.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.401 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about it that just a--

00:31:12.401 --> 00:31:15.290 align:middle line:84%
it takes the hard edges
off like that tinny sound

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I have the hard edges of
the world that I look at,

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.540 align:middle line:90%
probably at least half the time.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.412 align:middle line:90%
And I love it, personally.

00:31:25.412 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: I love that you love it.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.890 align:middle line:84%
It makes me so happy
that you're loving it.

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:29.723 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:31:29.723 --> 00:31:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And if you look at Greek
mythology, you'll see the Sias.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:84%
They are the
archetype of the Sia.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:90%
They usually blind--

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's true.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: --because they
see more than most.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:38.568 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:31:38.568 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Not needing the eyes,
same thing with the hearing

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:84%
is the hearing when
decreased actually

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.090 align:middle line:84%
becomes a truth filter because
it's navigating through energy.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Like dogs, they navigate
through energy, not necessarily

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:84%
through words, or appearance, or
how many followers you already

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:84%
have online, or any
of that sort of stuff.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's the same with your
eyesight is your ability

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:01.770 align:middle line:84%
to see more than most and
combine that with your scorpion

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:90%
nature--

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
we're both Scorpios.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:04.895 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I knew this
conversation--

00:32:04.895 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're both
Valentine babies.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Both of our mothers
enjoyed Valentine's Day.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.400 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.330 align:middle line:84%
My sister's birthdays
one day after mine,

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.680 align:middle line:84%
so I know my mom
enjoyed Valentine's Day,

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.180 align:middle line:90%
nine months out.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go to another key
that you and Richard and I all

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:26.180 align:middle line:84%
have but it has a shadow
that almost all of society

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:90%
seems to have.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
generationally epidemic.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to the number 56.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Distraction.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: With the gift or
the city of intoxication.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
my favorite part.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.660 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
that because it's

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:84%
almost as though
in mass our society

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:45.630 align:middle line:90%
is living on distraction.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Yes.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
impacting certainly

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I think people probably
under the age of 60, even 70

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.210 align:middle line:84%
because we're all now
plugged into technology

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and the distraction around
us of constant bombardment

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Very enticing and
seductive little posts

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:84%
that come through, and boom
we're down the rabbit hole.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.357 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about that, key 56.

00:33:12.357 --> 00:33:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Well, our greatest
spiritual currency that exists

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:90%
is our attention.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.635 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's constantly
being fought for all the time.

00:33:19.635 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And if we have an app on our
phone that we don't pay for,

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.203 align:middle line:90%
then we are the product.

00:33:23.203 --> 00:33:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we are.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Our attention
is the product.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.553 align:middle line:84%
We can give a little bit of
context of even just that.

00:33:28.553 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to understand
what we're actually

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.143 align:middle line:84%
working with here
is that there is

00:33:32.143 --> 00:33:34.560 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual warfare around our
attention that's happening.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.477 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you bet.

00:33:35.477 --> 00:33:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Constantly.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Intentional.

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And so also
recognizing, yes,

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
as we talk about the overarching
theme of "The Gene Keys"

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.510 align:middle line:84%
being our greatest challenges
so a greatest gift, you, me,

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and Richard, which brings me
so much delight to know that we

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:48.260 align:middle line:84%
all share the same gene
key in the same position--

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the same place,
right here in the center.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: --is the
core of our being,

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.340 align:middle line:84%
which is the ability
to associate people

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.140 align:middle line:90%
with our presence.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And we're
not talking about I

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.070 align:middle line:84%
think intoxicated on a
good whiskey over here

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.190 align:middle line:84%
but intoxication in the
sense of when you have

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:84%
my full, undivided attention,
I can intoxicate you

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:84%
into a place of timelessness
with my presence that

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.370 align:middle line:84%
allows you to feel fully seen,
fully acknowledged, and fully

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:84%
loved, which is the greatest
gift we can ever give anybody.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Now, if we
are distracted,

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:84%
we're going to suck
life out of the space.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.947 align:middle line:84%
It's like what was
happening with all the noise

00:34:22.947 --> 00:34:23.780 align:middle line:90%
in the room earlier.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:24.580 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what?

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.150 align:middle line:90%
I can't even-- what's going on?

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:26.991 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Yes, exactly.

00:34:26.991 --> 00:34:28.199 align:middle line:90%
And I'm right there with you.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I feel that exact
same piece is it's

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:34.130 align:middle line:84%
like a scattered energy
of recognizing that just

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.219 align:middle line:90%
like water.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Water has the power.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:39.782 align:middle line:84%
When it is focused to cut
glass, it can be that powerful.

00:34:39.782 --> 00:34:41.449 align:middle line:84%
However, also when
it's not focused more

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:84%
like a sprinkling
system, then it's

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.550 align:middle line:90%
actually not that powerful.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that, the
sprinkling system

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.250 align:middle line:90%
is like us and our distraction.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, I'm a
little bit over here,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000 align:middle line:90%
a little bit over there.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.190 align:middle line:90%
It's very watered down.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.020 align:middle line:90%
It's very unfocused.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.739 align:middle line:90%
It's not powerful.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the training for us is
that from the moment that we

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:00.770 align:middle line:84%
wake up to the
moment we go to bed,

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.840 align:middle line:84%
are we monitoring
our distractions

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and training the mind to be
present with every single

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:84%
thing, whether it's washing the
dishes, having a phone call,

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.300 align:middle line:90%
or having an interview?

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.710 align:middle line:90%
How present are we?

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And how can we bring
our full focus into that

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and strengthen that muscle so
that we are recognizing, oh,

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.600 align:middle line:84%
our weaknesses to
become very distracted?

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Also a superpower is to
be super intoxicating.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And so how can I train myself
in the mundane moments,

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:84%
in the in-between moments to
train my focus so that when

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I am sitting with
whatever it is,

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.240 align:middle line:90%
I have my undivided attention?

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing that gift
over a series of time

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.090 align:middle line:84%
with a series of
interactions will

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.730 align:middle line:84%
start to plant very
potent seeds everywhere we

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:84%
go because somebody that
feels seen and somebody that

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:84%
feels acknowledged
and somebody that

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.850 align:middle line:84%
feels like they have
your undivided attention

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.375 align:middle line:90%
leaves a wake of beauty--

00:35:51.375 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: --in our passage.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you tend
to work a lot with women.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And we already said you do gene
key interpretation for people

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:04.250 align:middle line:84%
to help guide them to seeing
the beauty within themselves

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and planting these seeds
you just talked about.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.950 align:middle line:10%
So one of your things
is the sisterhood,

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:12.440 align:middle line:10%
pulling women together
after thousands

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:10%
of years of pulling
each other's hair out

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:19.100 align:middle line:10%
and competing with one another
and denigrating ourselves.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, with the
women reading their gifts

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:23.810 align:middle line:84%
in "The Gene Keys,"
oh, no, that's not me.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is you.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
this all weaves together

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:33.290 align:middle line:84%
for you and your resistance
to develop a true sisterhood.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: I think your example is
such a perfect example of what

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.460 align:middle line:90%
you just said.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.127 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, I don't have
that within myself.

00:36:39.127 --> 00:36:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you do.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:42.995 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, when
we can actually sit

00:36:42.995 --> 00:36:46.490 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship
with a group of women

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and to transcend competition
into inspiration,

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.110 align:middle line:84%
it's a one degree
shift to the right.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.658 align:middle line:84%
However, that's when our
geniuses can start to swap.

00:36:55.658 --> 00:36:57.950 align:middle line:84%
The second we're comparing
ourselves with somebody else

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.530 align:middle line:84%
is when there is a block
between being able to receive

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:90%
the gift of each other.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And how I like to
see it is like we're

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:05.720 align:middle line:90%
like individual pieces of fruit.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:84%
You're a watermelon, and
I'm an apple, for example.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.012 align:middle line:84%
Now, if an apple was to
try and be a watermelon--

00:37:10.012 --> 00:37:11.845 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, I wish I
was a little bit more

00:37:11.845 --> 00:37:14.000 align:middle line:84%
like the watermelon--
it's completely bypassing

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.555 align:middle line:90%
the gift of it being apple.

00:37:15.555 --> 00:37:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: So recognizing
that we all

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.870 align:middle line:84%
have our own flavor and
our texture and smells

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and colors and
vibrancy and the second

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.440 align:middle line:84%
we try to be like
somebody else is

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.470 align:middle line:84%
the second we bypass
them the genius that

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:29.150 align:middle line:90%
is who we are by birthright.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And so by being in the
presence of other women

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.440 align:middle line:84%
recognizing there is a
core wound in humanity,

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's women turned
against each other, women

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.940 align:middle line:84%
competing for attention,
women recognizing

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.710 align:middle line:84%
if I don't get attention,
this is directly

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.120 align:middle line:90%
linked to my survival.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it has been.

00:37:42.305 --> 00:37:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: It has been,
and it has been.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Historically
it has been.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And that is stored
in the memory of our DNA.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: However, it is not
the actual truth right now.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So what it's doing is
feeding an illusion,

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.990 align:middle line:84%
which is creating separation,
which is allowing us to restore

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:55.260 align:middle line:90%
the balance on the planet.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.337 align:middle line:84%
So sisterhood is
essential to the evolution

00:37:58.337 --> 00:38:00.920 align:middle line:84%
of our collective consciousness,
our individual consciousness,

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and about allowing
to receive ourselves

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:03.982 align:middle line:90%
beyond our own illusions.

00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How do you do that?

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.040 align:middle line:84%
How do you model
it so that we're

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.680 align:middle line:84%
living in this balance
between the yin and the yang

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.307 align:middle line:90%
with each other and within?

00:38:11.307 --> 00:38:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: It's a little
bit like the gene

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.640 align:middle line:84%
keys in the sense of
it's all encompassing

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that we go into the
shadow define the gift.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.228 align:middle line:84%
We don't bypass the shadow
and go, oh, love and light.

00:38:19.228 --> 00:38:21.520 align:middle line:84%
On this hand, it's hold hands
in a circle wearing white

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and call ourselves goddesses.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what's beautiful.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:23.410 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:26.180 align:middle line:84%
"The Gene Keys" does
not-- this is not kumbaya.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.770 align:middle line:90%
You look at your whole self.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: We go down,
in, and then up.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: It's not, ah, prr.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:34.520 align:middle line:90%
It's just a bypass.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And there's a lot
of bypassing that happens

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.590 align:middle line:90%
in this virtual community.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And so the mantra
that we bring forward,

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.220 align:middle line:84%
which was relayed by one of
my teachers and a dear sister

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.170 align:middle line:84%
is the most sacred
thing is what is.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:47.955 align:middle line:84%
So if you're feeling rage,
if you're feeling anger,

00:38:47.955 --> 00:38:50.330 align:middle line:84%
if you're feeling jealousy,
if you're feeling separation,

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:53.180 align:middle line:84%
if you're feeling division
inside of your being,

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.140 align:middle line:90%
bring it to the altar.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:90%
It is welcome here.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:56.270 align:middle line:90%
We will love that, too.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.710 align:middle line:84%
We love the dark
side of the moon

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.370 align:middle line:84%
as much as the light
side of the moon.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:84%
We cannot have the light side of
the moon without the dark side

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:02.620 align:middle line:90%
of the moon.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And also recognizing
that we get to make peace

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.030 align:middle line:84%
with the dark feminine
that lives within us too

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that's the
all encompassing feminine.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And so if a sister brings
forward a unpopular opinion of,

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.320 align:middle line:84%
oh, actually you
said this and it

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:84%
made me feel this certain
way, we embrace it.

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.080 align:middle line:90%
We accept it.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:90%
We welcome it.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.050 align:middle line:90%
We break it down.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And we recognize
that actually this

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.220 align:middle line:84%
is the medicine because
within the trigger,

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.730 align:middle line:84%
there's a five Ts, Trust
That Trigger To Teach.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So instead of ostracizing
it, oh, well this

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:84%
is an uncomfortable feeling,
then she's not welcome back,

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.060 align:middle line:84%
this is actually
a very deep issue

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.480 align:middle line:84%
within the spiritual community
is how can we lean deeper

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.390 align:middle line:90%
into this?

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.510 align:middle line:90%
And there is a--

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:48.870 align:middle line:84%
even in the shadow, the
shadow for the shadow sake,

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:51.890 align:middle line:84%
the reason we indulge
that is because we're

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.690 align:middle line:90%
getting something out of it.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:56.840 align:middle line:84%
It can be a repetition of an
old pattern that's familiar.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And that might be just
where our comfort is.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.453 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah, I felt
like this a long time.

00:40:01.453 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling myself
the same story.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.560 align:middle line:90%
I keep on doing that.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think to dive into, how
does that story act surely

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.370 align:middle line:84%
make you feel when you
tell yourself that?

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Is it still working for you?

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And are we ready to
transform that story

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:84%
because it actually gives me
a bit of a knot in my stomach

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Contraction.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --grinding
and judgmental

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:22.640 align:middle line:90%
is what comes out of it.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And then out of
judgement, judgmental

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:84%
is how a person can feel
superior over another person.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, people are getting
something out of their shadows,

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.060 align:middle line:84%
which oftentimes can
even come from past lives

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and past experiences in
their lives and trauma.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So to go in and
feel it like, yeah,

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.280 align:middle line:84%
what am I getting out of
it, I think it's important.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Before you let go of it, what
am I getting out of this shadow?

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: It's essentially we
can only move through it

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.467 align:middle line:84%
by going into it and
through it and feeling

00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:90%
into the entirety of our beings.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And so within these
spaces that we create,

00:40:55.190 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
we also have safe places to
express the shadow nature.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's an
exercise that we do

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:04.340 align:middle line:84%
is called oracleing, which
is we go in the center,

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and whatever is most alive,
we give full permission to it.

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And that could be
ragging into a pillow.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: That could be like
yelling out to the world

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and being held and
witnessed within it.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it's about
going into the crunchy.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:23.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like feeling the crunchy
from the entirety of it

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and having a healthy outlet
because where we get sick

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:29.990 align:middle line:84%
is when we don't allow ourselves
to feel the entirety of what

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:31.350 align:middle line:90%
is moving through us.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we need safe spaces on
this planet we genuinely feel.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is the
interesting ironic thing

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.980 align:middle line:84%
of it is if we're watching
a film, for example,

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and our heroine or
our hero breaks down

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.030 align:middle line:84%
in the most vulnerable part
of themselves comes seeping

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:49.730 align:middle line:84%
through, and they're a
heap of tears, that's

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:52.760 align:middle line:84%
when our hearts crack
open, and we love them

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.630 align:middle line:84%
because we recognize the
vulnerability not just

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.070 align:middle line:90%
in each other but in ourselves.

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:58.910 align:middle line:90%
We relate to it.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:02.652 align:middle line:84%
We spend all of our lives
trying to show us the best side.

00:42:02.652 --> 00:42:04.110 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing
about social media

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm not happy about,
everyone showing

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.040 align:middle line:84%
their sizzle reel, their best
side, their hot, wise self.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They're not seeing the
rest of the person.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.460 align:middle line:90%
And so we keep doing that.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it's that
vulnerable, little, frightened

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.400 align:middle line:84%
piece that every person
has somewhere in there

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.130 align:middle line:84%
that we actually are called
forth by in each other.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's OK to
recognize the shadow.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the perfection
of "The Gene Key" work.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I have that.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I was stupid.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I paid the price
because I was deaf,

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.528 align:middle line:90%
willfully deaf, mind you.

00:42:35.528 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BLU: Yes.

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And that actually is
where true power lies.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:41.898 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:42:41.898 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: It's the all
encompassing claiming

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.790 align:middle line:84%
of that which has been,
that which is here,

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and that which I'm moving
into in my full humanness

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.810 align:middle line:84%
because it's our humanness
that connects us.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.357 align:middle line:84%
It's not the shiny,
polished photo.

00:42:53.357 --> 00:42:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's nothing
new under the sun.

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.680 align:middle line:84%
We all share these basic,
common human traits

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.220 align:middle line:90%
to one degree or another.

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.960 align:middle line:90%
So we're just about out of time.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So I want to say there's
so much more to talk about.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But just go ahead and share
with us any final thoughts

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:10.243 align:middle line:90%
you have on this whole topic.

00:43:10.243 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: Well, I would just
have to say acknowledgment

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.750 align:middle line:84%
of thank you so much for
bringing this topic forward.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:19.822 align:middle line:84%
Richard Rudd, I believe, is a
genuine real life wizard and--

00:43:19.822 --> 00:43:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He really is.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.390 align:middle line:90%
And everyone loves him.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.190 align:middle line:90%
He's loveable.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.310 align:middle line:90%
He's just so gracious and kind.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.715 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And he's
extremely humble.

00:43:26.715 --> 00:43:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, he is.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: What I
appreciate so deeply

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:34.470 align:middle line:84%
is that the profanity of the
teachings of "The Gene Keys."

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and if you just open
the book and just absorb

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:39.500 align:middle line:84%
a couple of sentences, you
realize how dense it is.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:45.852 align:middle line:84%
And then meeting him in person
and his innocence and his--

00:43:45.852 --> 00:43:46.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sweetness.

00:43:46.685 --> 00:43:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: --humble nature and
his love and his relatability

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.890 align:middle line:84%
allows me to truly
understand what

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.820 align:middle line:84%
it means to recognize of
saying, this came through me

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:84%
as an expression and as
transmission to the collective.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And I am still a
forever student.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.210 align:middle line:90%
And there is no hierarchy.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:03.980 align:middle line:90%
There is no pedal stalling.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.830 align:middle line:10%
There is no-- or this person
has all of the answers,

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:08.330 align:middle line:10%
and they're just
telling all of us

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:11.660 align:middle line:10%
but to actually truly understand
the essence of what it means

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.730 align:middle line:10%
to be a student of
life until the moment

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:15.805 align:middle line:10%
we take our last breath
and to just from that

00:44:15.805 --> 00:44:17.180 align:middle line:10%
place of being a
student of life,

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.640 align:middle line:10%
share what works, share
what doesn't work, create

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.010 align:middle line:10%
a level of relatability,
and to transcend

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.410 align:middle line:10%
the pyramid into a
circle where we are all

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:10%
equals in our own expression
and our own nature,

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.220 align:middle line:10%
and we all bring a
peace to the table

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.860 align:middle line:10%
and recognizing everybody
has a superpower,

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:10%
and everybody has a challenge.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:33.447 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is exempt.

00:44:33.447 --> 00:44:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nobody's exempt.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BLU: And so if we can
embrace our challenge

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.470 align:middle line:84%
as much as we embrace the
beautiful parts of ourselves,

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.205 align:middle line:84%
that is where the
true power lies.

00:44:41.205 --> 00:44:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And you've said it perfectly.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.320 align:middle line:84%
