[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVEN ROSS: Snowballs,
tumors melting.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.110 align:middle line:90%
So what are we capable of?

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.910 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.285 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: That's what
we're capable of and more.

00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I've seen someone burned
in my presence with an iron.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.217 align:middle line:90%
They joked.

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you're supposed
to be the healer.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you do something?

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:90%
So I went over, blew on it.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.140 align:middle line:90%
The pain was gone.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.170 align:middle line:84%
If people were tuned
into themselves,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:84%
they would either
get information

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:84%
through their
consciousness or in dreams.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:84%
But since most
people don't do that,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
their own higher self
manifests something

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
in their physical being to make
you stop, look, and listen.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Why is this little voice that's
always inside every one of us

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
always dwelling on the
negative thing that happened?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:10%
The three keys to all
manifestation, imagination,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:10%
faith, and--

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We have one of our
favorite in-house mystics

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:10%
back with us, Steven Ross.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're going to be
tackling the subject of belief,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.090 align:middle line:10%
as in how beliefs can severely
limit our capabilities in life.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Steven himself has
broken through our belief

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.830 align:middle line:84%
that the body is solid
and slow to heal,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and has helped hundreds
of people spontaneously

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:90%
heal from the worst of diseases.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:90%
But how does that happen?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.297 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Steven.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And before I get into
it, I want to thank you.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And I never take any of
these interviews for granted.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.788 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate the invites here.

00:01:39.788 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, well
you're so welcome.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, you're back
because everybody loves you.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.292 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're
going to start out

00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
talking about the principle
that habit is not law.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.118 align:middle line:84%
And so we're taking belief
uses the power of belief.

00:01:54.118 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking about
the power of belief

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:84%
today to actually interfere
with our own good.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --habit is not law.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to
start with a joke.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:90%
and a true story.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, that's Steven.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: So a 92-year-old man
goes to his medical doctor

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:90%
and has an examination.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:10%
And then two weeks later, the
doctor sees the man in public

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.670 align:middle line:10%
with a gorgeous young
lady on his arm.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:10%
A month later, he goes
back for an examination.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:10%
The doctor says, you are
really doing wonderfully.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:10%
And the man says,
I did exactly what

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.200 align:middle line:10%
you told me, to get a hot
mamma and be cheerful.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor looks at him
and says, I didn't say that.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.915 align:middle line:84%
I said, you have a heart
murmur, and be careful.

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] That's cute.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: So along with that
now, Harvard Medical School,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:84%
every year, one
of the professors

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:84%
tells the following story to the
people in the heart division.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:90%
He was making his rounds.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
He came to the bed of a
patient who was in a coma.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And they were expecting to take
over the bed at any minute.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And he had six interns with him.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So the doctor puts the
stethoscope on the man

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and said to all the interns,
listen, listen to that.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the
wholeness of the beat.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So each of the interns
listens and goes,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:90%
oh, yes, we hear that.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, they expected the
man to die any moment.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:90%
But a week later, the man is up.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:90%
He's walking around.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, he checks
out of the hospital.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor sees him and
says, you are a miracle.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And the man said, well,
that's not what you told me.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said,
what did I tell you?

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
The man said, when you came to
me and said, my heart was whole

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and six other doctors
agreed, I thought it was OK.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, not only did
he think he was OK,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:90%
his heart was 100% rectified.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.670 align:middle line:90%
The man was in a coma.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:84%
He was ready to die,
but he still heard that.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm setting our parameters
that habits, belief systems

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:84%
have locked us in to what is
truly the potential of what

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:90%
we are all capable of.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I
want to get across

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:90%
in our sharing today, Regina.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:90%
We have unlimited potentials.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We absolutely do.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:90%
And we read biographies--

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
people who enjoy
reading biographies

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.530 align:middle line:84%
are always just stunned
that this person just

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.310 align:middle line:90%
believed they could do it.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
They didn't necessarily
have the tools.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the money
or backing or education,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, but they
believed they could do it.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's really the seed--

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.138 align:middle line:84%
that's that-- if without
that, it won't happen.

00:04:49.138 --> 00:04:49.938 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Correct.

00:04:49.938 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with
that, anything

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.940 align:middle line:90%
can happen pretty much.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And that's what
we're going to share

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.367 align:middle line:90%
in our brief time today.

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:58.659 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we're going
to show a couple images too.

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.905 align:middle line:84%
And you have this magnificent
book from the 1700s

00:05:00.905 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
here with-- we're going
to share all of that.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And people are excited because
everyone loves a miracle,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
but everyone feels
like that's something

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
far off for saints and
mystics and people like you.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Mystics.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
let's talk about,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.363 align:middle line:84%
from your perception, what
the human being is capable of.

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Right now, even though we're
going through our advancement

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.260 align:middle line:84%
as a species and our evolution,
transformation, right now,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
what are we capable
of as a species?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: We are capable of
instantaneous healings,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
not only for ourselves
but for others.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
We are capable of physical
bodies that can do even more.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about people
who lift backends of cars.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that may be a
couple of steps down.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking
about people who

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
lift thousands of pounds of
weight, where the greatest

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
weightlifters may not
be able to do that.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
We are capable of
having our minds travel

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:84%
great distances while our
physical body is in one place.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
But we're capable of taking that
body to other locations too,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:90%
bilocation.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
That is also possible
and has been done.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you, we are
all capable of doing it.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, sir.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Someone has to give
everyone permission

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
to be outlandish enough to
believe that of themselves.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And--

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we've
been so beaten down

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:90%
in our beliefs of ourselves.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, a lot of
it has to do with what

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:90%
people are listening to.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Now without getting into
it, but getting into it,

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
the politics, the
division in this world

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.260 align:middle line:84%
is stopping people from
looking internally.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.333 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Everybody is external.

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:51.458 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is coming
up in every interview now.

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: If we just--

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And even though people--

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
some people in the
spiritual community

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:84%
talk about the advancement we
have and our souls are ready,

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to be ready
if we're locked into what

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:90%
is taking place always outside.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't make
any difference

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
whether you're on the right
side of the discussion

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:84%
or the left side
of the discussion,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
we're going away
from what is inside

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.850 align:middle line:90%
and what we're capable of.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I'm a
very firm believer, even

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
some of the quote,
"gurus" and people

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
who are out there lecturing, you
and I have talked about this,

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them do not know
what they're talking about,

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.918 align:middle line:84%
and they do not live
what they're saying.

00:07:37.918 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's correct.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.627 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They can tell
an audience, well,

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:90%
you can do this and that.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.210 align:middle line:84%
When I've met these
people for meals

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.840 align:middle line:84%
after we've been on the
podium, somebody talks to me

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:84%
about prosperity
consciousness and goes,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.220 align:middle line:90%
oh, things are not going well.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:84%
You just gave an entire
presentation on--

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.447 align:middle line:84%
why aren't you able to
live with your thought?

00:07:57.447 --> 00:07:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why aren't
you embodying it?

00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's a flaw
in the belief system there.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.278 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, because they
don't think they can--

00:08:03.278 --> 00:08:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this becomes--

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --do it.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:90%
It's just a theoretical concept.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Correct.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like teach best
what we need to learn, right?

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like that.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So I want to bring something
up right now because you're

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:84%
talking about physical
manifestations.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll start moving
into the rest of this.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: OK.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In a book called
"The Physics of God,"

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:84%
by Joseph Selbie, one of
the examples he brings up

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:84%
is a woman that had
multiple personalities.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:90%
She had 10 personalities.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And she was so intriguing.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
They actually studied
her physiologically

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:84%
as the personalities
change, which brings--

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I'd love to
get your take on this,

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:90%
as the personalities change.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
What happened is
her eye color would

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:90%
change with personalities.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Her voice changed.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Moles would come onto the skin
and disappear from the skin,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All-- her
blood type changed.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
were changing

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:90%
as her personalities changed.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were witnessing
drawing blood and blah.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this-- to
me, this is one

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.210 align:middle line:84%
of the most wonderful
stories of what energy can do

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and how quickly it
can change matter.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So of course, now, I'm
going to be esoteric about it.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, are these
past life imprints?

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Are these other entities
reaching in with their imprints

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.307 align:middle line:90%
because she's so permeable?

00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:84%
How do you-- how do you
see multiple personalities

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.190 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I like your
first explanation

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:90%
that it is a combination.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I am a little bit not
involved with devils,

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.800 align:middle line:84%
with outside influences
having that much of a control.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does happen.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.251 align:middle line:84%
But the past life
explanation is very real.

00:09:48.251 --> 00:09:50.876 align:middle line:84%
There is so much, believe it or
not, Regina, in the literature.

00:09:50.876 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cause
that's in our aura.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Yes, all
that is capable.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And it is in
scientific literature,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:84%
but nobody likes
to talk about it.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's a good
time to bring up Mr. Wright.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Wright had cancer tumors.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And this was written by Dr.
Klopfer in the psychology

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:90%
magazines.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
He had tumors the
size of snowballs.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Krebiozen, which was a new
extract for cancer, came out.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And his doctor was one
of the clinical trials.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the clinical
trials said that people

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:84%
had to have at least
a year expectancy.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
While Mr. Wright
had tumors so bad,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:90%
he was on a breathing apparatus.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.410 align:middle line:84%
They didn't expect
him to last two weeks.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But he goes to his doctor,
Klopfer, and he says,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
can you please put
me on the Krebiozen?

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor says, I
really can't because you

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:90%
don't have a year's expectancy.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I'll
tell you what, I'm

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
going to give it to you off
the books, out of the study.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.830 align:middle line:90%
So he gives it to Mr. Wright.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:03.542 align:middle line:84%
And within two weeks, every
tumor is gone, the size of--

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you
said, snowballs.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Snowballs.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Well, he's out.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:90%
He's flying an airplane.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And then an article came
out, Krebiozen didn't work.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And no doctor had
any faith in it.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mr. Wright, overnight,
developed all the tumors back

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.510 align:middle line:90%
and ends in the hospital.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.675 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, this in
the medical literature.

00:11:26.675 --> 00:11:27.475 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:27.475 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: So the doctor
looks and says,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.490 align:middle line:84%
this is physically impossible
according to our laws.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So he says to Mr. Wright, I am
giving you a double strength

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Krebiozen.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:39.773 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:11:39.773 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And within three days,
all the tumors were gone again.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.650 align:middle line:90%
He is flying.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Now it came out
that Krebiozen was

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:90%
banned in the United States.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And within one week, Mr. Wright
was dead because he listened.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My God.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --here's the
caveat to the story.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
The doctor didn't have
the real Krebiozen.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:90%
He had the placebo.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: So he didn't even know.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.962 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: So snowballs,
tumors, melting.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:90%
So what are we capable of?

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
we're capable of and more.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Instantly.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But instead,
people remain attached

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.650 align:middle line:90%
to their stories of illness.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:90%
But that's programmed.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
That's programmed by the
pharmaceutical industry

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that the only way that
you're going to be rectified,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
no more nature is
going to help you,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:90%
you have to be taking this pill.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And the white coat is
going to save your life.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Now I am not advocating people
not going a particular route,

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:84%
but I'm saying, you've
got to have common sense.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Somehow, people survived.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Nature is one of the
greatest curealls.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But we are giving away
our power, Regina.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was looking for.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: We're giving
away our power outside.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So how can we truly
trust what's inside

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.285 align:middle line:84%
if we don't believe inside
is giving us a true story?

00:13:13.285 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
sadly, we're bathed

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:84%
in a sea of people like us that
have the same limited belief

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:90%
and have given their power away.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.422 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you try
to say no, I'm going to--

00:13:22.422 --> 00:13:23.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing this thing.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I believe I can do it.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And you have all these
voices around you.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.055 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this is
the hero's journey--

00:13:29.055 --> 00:13:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --isn't it?

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.912 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This always
is the hero's journey

00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:90%
is like, oh, he's crazy.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.530 align:middle line:90%
He can't make it.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So not-- really having to
detach from what others have

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to say and the voices
in our head from around

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.550 align:middle line:84%
us is as important as finding
that belief inside ourselves.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well-- and
here's the other part.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.230 align:middle line:84%
We started with
habit is not law.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it isn't
just the other people.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.470 align:middle line:90%
We fall into our habits, Regina.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: This is
what we always do.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:90%
This is how we do it.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
This is we're going to--
and because of that, we

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.570 align:middle line:90%
don't venture out.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:84%
We don't break through
that energy pattern of,

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:90%
this is what I do.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be the result.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So if something is
slightly askew from how

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
it's been before, but
this is our habit,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.720 align:middle line:90%
then it may not work.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we call into
question, oh, my gosh,

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:90%
this is not working anymore.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we quickly
run somewhere else

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:90%
to have them give us the fix.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, we didn't have
full faith to begin with.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And it's the faith.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
have the patience.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
have the will.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
very basic terms

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Manly P. Hall spoke in
his books extensively,

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.470 align:middle line:84%
about having this faith and
having true faith, true will,

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and applying will
in a proper way,

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:90%
not in a willful stubborn way.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.082 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain
the difference.

00:14:50.082 --> 00:14:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So now you're a person
who's listening to you.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.550 align:middle line:90%
You're someone in our audience.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And say, there's something
going on in your body.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And doctors have been
pushing you around.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:90%
You've been on every drug.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not going the way you want.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're now
making a statement

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.320 align:middle line:84%
to self, how does that kind
of will and belief look?

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.880 align:middle line:90%
And how do you employ it?

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: I look at it like this.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:84%
If people were tuned
into themselves,

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.910 align:middle line:84%
they would either
get information

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
through their
consciousness or in dreams.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:10%
But since most people don't
do that, their own higher self

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:10%
manifests something in their
physical being to make you

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:10%
stop, look, and listen,
to question with things

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:10%
you're doing.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:84%
You say to yourself, this
just didn't befall me

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:90%
because I'm an unlucky person.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Could I have brought
this on upon myself

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:84%
because of something
I've done in my life?

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Or a belief system, when people
call and I've counseled people

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:84%
now, gosh, it's
been like 50 years,

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:84%
that's the first thing
I start talking to them.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
What was going on in
your life 12 to 16 months

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.428 align:middle line:90%
before your diagnosis?

00:16:05.428 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Key number one.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So if anyone's listening,
pause for a moment and go back.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.860 align:middle line:84%
What was happening
12 to 16 months ago

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:90%
before this fully manifested?

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And every single time,
the person will say, oh,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be a
multitude: family, friend,

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
loved one, husband, wife,
father, oh, yeah, audit

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
by the IRS, whatever
it was, it was

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:84%
something that
overwhelmed the psyche

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:90%
of that particular person.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:90%
And then we start peeling it.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So somebody in your audience
needs to look and believe me,

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:50.730 align:middle line:84%
God and the world does not just
punish people for no reason.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.374 align:middle line:90%
We are breaking some sort of--

00:16:54.374 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:90%
whether it's the law of nature.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Now what is the law of nature?

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:84%
If you gluttonly stuff
yourself or you take things

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle line:84%
you're allergic to,
you're going to get ill.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you do erroneous thinking
that's negative, negative,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:84%
negative-- and we're going to
discuss this little voice, why

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:16.119 align:middle line:84%
is this little voice that's
always inside every one of us

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
always dwelling on the
negative thing that happened?

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
You and I have an experience,
the little voice is going,

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:90%
I should have done this.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't we do that?

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:10%
This is going to happen.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
happy experience,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't last very long.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Why is that little voice just
be happy through the whole day

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:90%
and go, oh, my gosh.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:90%
This was great.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you would find
people happy and fulfilled.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.930 align:middle line:84%
But that little voice is always
going, no, no, this is wrong.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:90%
This is going to happen.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.920 align:middle line:84%
This person is going
to tell me off.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do that.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.260 align:middle line:84%
That little voice is
digging and gnawing

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:84%
like a mouse on
something on a wire.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I look at, let's start
addressing this inward more,

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
ask the same person
in the audience,

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
is that little voice
just clanging on you

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over?

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Then you need to quiet it down.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And stop.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Just take a pause and trace it.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
What just made that
little voice speak up?

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Because then you're just getting
into deep subconscious stuff.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And people like to beat up
on the subconscious mind.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's one
of my passions is

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:84%
the notion of what
we're listening to

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:90%
within our own mindset.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And the subconscious is
there to try to protect us

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:90%
on a survival level.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.627 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it doesn't
want us to do anything

00:18:41.627 --> 00:18:43.700 align:middle line:84%
that detaches us
from the community

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:84%
or that could be
perceived as wrong,

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:84%
so we could be outcast and
thus, unsafe, or right down

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:84%
to something that's more
specific about walking

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.070 align:middle line:90%
in front of a car or whatever.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
there, gnawing at us,

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.297 align:middle line:84%
because it's just doing its job,
which is, no, no, no, no, no.

00:19:00.297 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: We're human.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Trying to protect us.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It's protecting us.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Make sure
you're part of the tribe.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Everything's OK.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:90%
You're safe.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:06.522 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:19:06.522 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
don't beat it up,

00:19:08.035 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
but we have to stop and
say, hold on a minute now.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason for me to be
asking that question of myself.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Try the old five minute
test and listen and watch

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:18.270 align:middle line:90%
everything your mind brings up--

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --even though you
say, OK, this is what it is.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:90%
We're just going to do this.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Look how many subjects
and times, and I

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
don't care how far along you
go, that little voice is there

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
because it's part of
the mechanism of being

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:90%
in a physical body.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, it's just
a part of a survival mechanism.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's all.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.703 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
beat it up, but we

00:19:39.703 --> 00:19:41.750 align:middle line:84%
don't have to listen to
it either all the time.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, don't walk
out in front of a car.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.950 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Yeah, definitely,
don't bump into things.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beyond that.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.883 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't have
to listen to the chatter.

00:19:49.883 --> 00:19:50.720 align:middle line:90%
So you and I--

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:84%
before, off camera,
we had talked

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
about the notion of
where humans have broken

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.620 align:middle line:84%
through certain limits
like, it was a big one

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
when Roger Bannister broke
through the four-minute mile,

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And I have an extensive
sports background,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.467 align:middle line:90%
so I'm very familiar.

00:20:05.467 --> 00:20:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you were in track.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Yes, I ran
track and field.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:90%
But I was a sprinter, not the--

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:90%
the mile.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But nobody believed you
could break four minutes.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.830 align:middle line:84%
They really-- there was some
writings that said your joints

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.503 align:middle line:84%
would not be able to hold
up in a physical body--

00:20:21.503 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They'd blow apart?

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:23.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what--

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Yeah, they
would just fall apart

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:90%
on the track, all the bones.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody said,
in order to break it,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
it would have to be a
68 degree day, no wind,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:84%
perfect conditions,
and good competition.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So here's Roger
Bannister in England.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Rainy, windy day.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.750 align:middle line:90%
It was worse than 68 degrees.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
There was no really
other good runner.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.687 align:middle line:90%
And he runs 3:59:4.

00:20:48.687 --> 00:20:51.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:90%
He broke the four minutes.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And after that, all
kinds of other athletes

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:90%
were able to break four minutes.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:84%
They were perfect
physical specimens,

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.880 align:middle line:90%
but that was not enough.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.118 align:middle line:90%
They needed the OK.

00:21:07.118 --> 00:21:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To believe
it was possible.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you know what
Roger Bannister had to say,

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.001 align:middle line:84%
was going on inside
him that day?

00:21:14.001 --> 00:21:16.126 align:middle line:84%
Did he ever make a comment
about what was going on?

00:21:16.126 --> 00:21:18.001 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: He-- and by the
way, he was knighted.

00:21:18.001 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So he ended up Sir
Roger Bannister.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:90%
He was a medical doctor.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.568 align:middle line:90%
He was a competitive athlete.

00:21:24.568 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he ever say what
happened that day when he just

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:90%
broke through?

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: I never read.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Although, I've read
reports from him.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:38.000 align:middle line:10%
But it never really said, I
knew-- no, he was a competitor.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:90%
And he went out.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, because the
conditions were bad,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:84%
he had to do more
to overcome them.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that
is the motivation.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is what we'll find
in some of the other examples

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
is that there is
a motivator that

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:84%
came into play where
we shifted gears

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.235 align:middle line:90%
from our habit, our fear--

00:22:01.235 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To our potential.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --or belief
to our true potential.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Shifted gears.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because I never read

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
him saying anything
particularly profound

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle line:90%
about that day, either.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: No.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought
maybe you had.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And there was
not enough competition

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.953 align:middle line:84%
like, it was neck and
neck, like a horse race.

00:22:14.953 --> 00:22:16.620 align:middle line:84%
They were boom, boom,
they hit the wire.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.733 align:middle line:90%
No, it was by himself.

00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he broke
it for everyone--

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Correct.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --for all the
others waiting to break it,

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.840 align:middle line:84%
to believe they could, which
is wonderful because it's

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:84%
such a simple clean
little example.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:90%
Now let's talk about--

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I want to go into because we
have some images that you've

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:90%
shared with me.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.142 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we've
got to share these.

00:22:33.142 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So people who've
watched us, before

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:84%
understand that you
learned early in life

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that this body can respond
very quickly to thought, mind,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:90%
and intention.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And so you felt, I don't
know, hundreds, if not

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:84%
thousands by now, I
don't know, of people.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:90%
And one day, you--

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I was in your home and you said,
well, this is what it's like,

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Regina.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And you handed me a pillowcase.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And the pillowcase had a bunch
of letters in it, and said,

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.160 align:middle line:90%
you could see how it works.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:90%
And people like, oh, my God.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:90%
The tumor went away.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll love you forever.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.340 align:middle line:84%
It was love letters because
you've helped people.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.253 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
don't charge for it.

00:23:10.253 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just what you are and
do from the past through now.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So on that note, let's
talk about this man

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.420 align:middle line:90%
that came to you.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And he had these
nasty looking red--

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what you call
them, all over his neck

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:90%
and his head and his face.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Well--

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What were they?

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: He spoke.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was a FaceTime.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:90%
So I was never with him.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And he woke up
with these heavy--

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:84%
more than just surface blotches
but lumps all over his body.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.070 align:middle line:90%
And we spoke a little bit.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And he asked if I might
be able to assist him.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:90%
I said I would.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.342 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
when he woke up, it was--

00:23:57.342 --> 00:23:59.467 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can see in
the pictures here, it was--

00:23:59.467 --> 00:24:00.023 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yeah, it was 90%--

00:24:00.023 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --gone.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:01.647 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --it was gone.

00:24:01.647 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What--
Did he call you?

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Yes, he-- well,
he sent the pictures.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:90%
He sent the pictures.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
He said, he had sent
the original pictures

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
to a medical doctor,
said, oh, my God.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:90%
We'll get you in.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Because he contacted
the doctor at night.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.220 align:middle line:84%
You've got to come
in the next day.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.380 align:middle line:90%
We'll look and see what's there.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:90%
But he had a picture of--

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
the picture in his
mind is of what he had.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:84%
The picture in my mind is
what he was not going to have.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:84%
The picture in my
mind, which replaced

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.771 align:middle line:90%
his picture was that he--

00:24:36.771 --> 00:24:38.146 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
perfected template.

00:24:38.146 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It was clear.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: But before we
make it, the people

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:84%
are going to be contacting
me for healings.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:90%
You and I discussed this.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't do that as
much as I told him.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:84%
He has to investigate
internally why this came up.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.690 align:middle line:90%
The same thing we said before.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Because he, of course, knew
that I have helped individuals.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I think
makes the best healers.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Healers don't heal people.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.030 align:middle line:90%
People heal themselves.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But the best
healers are the ones

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:19.050 align:middle line:84%
who set up the best
environment that the belief is

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.122 align:middle line:90%
going to take place.

00:25:20.122 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, the
perfect template--

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --for the outcome.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Why does it say in the Bible:
Because in his own hometown,

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:84%
because of their non-belief,
he could do no mighty miracles.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:90%
This was Jesus.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Because in his own
hometown, there

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
was a slightly different image
than the rest of the world

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.590 align:middle line:90%
has of him.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's a very
profound statement there.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: If somebody was
the one who does it,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.380 align:middle line:84%
they should be able
to do it every time.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It's their energy.

00:25:53.710 --> 00:26:00.650 align:middle line:84%
What we are doing is super
charging people's concepts

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:90%
by making an environment.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is why, I believe,
everybody listening

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to the news, all this division,
all this negativity, as opposed

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.550 align:middle line:84%
to if you were in a society
where everything was possible,

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:84%
where the belief system was
so strong that people just

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
assumed, well, you
could instantaneously

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:90%
take care of this.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Like the Kahunas, who are
able to do their magic.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Like the Laplanders in Lapland,
who sing particular songs,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:84%
and they heal split
open arteries,

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:90%
instantaneous healing.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Their culture believes and
knows this is going to happen.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you and I
grew up in a society

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.000 align:middle line:90%
where everything is possible.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Now there is a great book
by a man named Talbot called

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.380 align:middle line:90%
"The Holographic Universe."

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And one of the
chapters, chapter 7

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:84%
is called A Pocketful
of Miracles.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And in it, he talks about
all these things you

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and I are going to
talk about, including

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.700 align:middle line:84%
the example of a man
named Nathan Coker, who

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:16.010 align:middle line:84%
was a blacksmith, who
would handle molten lead,

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and put it in his mouth
until it cooled off,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.110 align:middle line:90%
and nothing would happen to him.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Or a 12-year-old boy who
would throw red hot horseshoes

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:90%
and play with them.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors and the New York
Herald in 1871 investigated.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:32.930 align:middle line:90%
They analyzed.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.440 align:middle line:84%
They go, their skin is
just like everybody else.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And they interviewed
him, little boy.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Oh, nobody told me I
can't play with these.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Nathaniel Coker, well, can't
everybody do this, molten lava?

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:49.302 align:middle line:84%
Not lava, but people
walk across lava also.

00:27:49.302 --> 00:27:50.102 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:50.102 --> 00:27:50.902 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It is if you
expect something to happen.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:84%
If it is commonplace
in that area.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.340 align:middle line:84%
We are all capable
of doing that.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So the Pocketful of Miracles
talks about societies

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:90%
that have a belief.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in
the society can do

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.780 align:middle line:90%
exactly what they all believe.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But even with that,
Regina, I don't

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:84%
believe in making
boundaries because that's

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.270 align:middle line:90%
what they believe.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.537 align:middle line:90%
But could there be even more?

00:28:19.537 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even more.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, I was going
to bring something else up.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
this book is about.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Correct.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.147 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This amazing book.

00:28:27.147 --> 00:28:28.270 align:middle line:90%
It's in French.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's about the
truth of miracles

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.480 align:middle line:84%
that had taken place and
been documented in what?

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:84%
17-- when was this
book published?

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: This book was
published in 1737.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And it is obviously,
the original book.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: And in the--

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:48.750 align:middle line:10%
around 1735, in Paris,
France, individuals

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.810 align:middle line:10%
had gone to a tomb of
their religious leader who

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:10%
had recently died.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And there was a couple of
very spontaneous healings.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But then, a whole group,
more than 1,000 people,

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:06.870 align:middle line:84%
started going into a
trance-like state, where

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
they would be struck with
30-pound sledgehammers 50

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.630 align:middle line:84%
times in the stomach with
no damage to the body.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Women would lie on a spike
and have a 50 pound stone

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:84%
drop, 20 feet, no damage to the
skin, nothing on their back.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:90%
They were burned.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:84%
They were cut and
sliced with knives.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Nothing penetrated their skin.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So the Catholic Church at the
time and the French parliament

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.230 align:middle line:84%
goes, whoa, wait a minute,
we're hearing reports.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So they send this author
out from the parliament

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.960 align:middle line:90%
to investigate.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:90%
He starts as a skeptic.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, they had to
send 3,000 volunteers out

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.180 align:middle line:84%
to watch over these people
because when they were being

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.090 align:middle line:84%
burned, the women's
clothes would burn off,

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.410 align:middle line:90%
but they were naked.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So the church sent out
these people to protect--

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For modesty purposes.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And that's
exactly what they said.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, this author goes out.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:84%
This book is documented
with notary testaments

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and statements of
everything these people

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.000 align:middle line:90%
were doing, which is--

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even stating it
all, they used hatchets,

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.175 align:middle line:90%
they used sledgehammers.

00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jesus.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Nothing.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, did they
do this to each other?

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: No.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.658 align:middle line:84%
They invited the
people, strike me.

00:30:32.658 --> 00:30:33.908 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To come and do this.

00:30:33.908 --> 00:30:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They would
say, strike me again.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.597 align:middle line:90%
Hit-- strike me again harder.

00:30:37.597 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So people
brought their-- whatever

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.540 align:middle line:90%
their apparatus from home.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.425 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Every single thing.

00:30:41.425 --> 00:30:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And in this book are
the testimonials, what happened,

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:90%
that before, the after.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So the result of
this book is this man

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.648 align:middle line:84%
is imprisoned in the
Bastille because they--

00:30:55.648 --> 00:30:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They sent
him out to document it.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's right.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't--
because they couldn't explain.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: They could
not explain it.

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:04.335 align:middle line:84%
So then eventually--
and I'm not--

00:31:04.335 --> 00:31:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
mention the religion.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.890 align:middle line:84%
The Catholic Church
came and said,

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.740 align:middle line:90%
this was the devil's work.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And the devil made
all of them do that.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.800 align:middle line:84%
However, why did
this impress me?

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I have always been interested
in human potential,

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and how far we can go, and
beliefs, and manifestations.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And these thousands
of people knew--

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:32.310 align:middle line:84%
they knew that they
could not be harmed.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Now if somebody looks
at that and thinks,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.030 align:middle line:84%
wow, I mean, that's
rare, 60 year--

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, the people were
called the Convulsionnaires.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:45.650 align:middle line:84%
They were Jansenist
philosophy Protestant.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Now 50 years before this, there
was another uprising religious

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.790 align:middle line:84%
that the Catholic Church
was not happy with.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And that group of soldiers went
out and were firing bullets

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.720 align:middle line:90%
at these people.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And the bullets were found
between their clothing

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and their body, never
striking their body.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So I, as a researcher,
like these anomalies.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But are they really anomalies
or are all of us capable?

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:23.070 align:middle line:84%
If you have 1,000 people doing
these things in this book,

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.532 align:middle line:90%
that's different than one man--

00:32:25.532 --> 00:32:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --one
prophet, one mystic.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:29.295 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It's--

00:32:29.295 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
random one off.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.580 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.552 align:middle line:84%
Now you and I are going to talk
about, is fear the motivator?

00:32:36.552 --> 00:32:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
because that's what

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask you about
is this hysterical strength.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And now you touched on
this a little while ago,

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that someone in under
certain conditions

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:49.290 align:middle line:84%
can lift far more
than the human body is

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:50.580 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be capable of.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And you and I,
before the show, I

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:58.050 align:middle line:84%
sent you about the woman
whose little young baby

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:02.725 align:middle line:84%
boy is under the car, and
the woman lifts the car.

00:33:02.725 --> 00:33:03.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:03.525 --> 00:33:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Lifts the car
up and the baby gets--

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and as a result,
the person who wrote

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.230 align:middle line:84%
the story of "The Hulk" and the
comic strip read that article.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:16.145 align:middle line:84%
And "The Hulk" is
based on this woman.

00:33:16.145 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This woman.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Not a man--

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
fascinated by that.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.747 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: By this woman.

00:33:20.747 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:90%
But now here's the thing.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.620 align:middle line:84%
She didn't do it out of--
did she do it out of fear

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:27.920 align:middle line:90%
or out of love?

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She did
it out of love.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:30.643 align:middle line:90%
It's her baby.

00:33:30.643 --> 00:33:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And that's
the difference.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that because
most people would say, just

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.920 align:middle line:84%
by the current medical
model, that her system was

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:90%
flooded with cortisol.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And this gave her
superhuman strength.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was the cortisol
responding to fear,

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.010 align:middle line:90%
like stop this now.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.600 align:middle line:90%
My baby's going to be killed.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So how do we put these
two concepts together?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And is that superhuman fear,
superhuman love, how does that

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.065 align:middle line:90%
work if it's love versus fear?

00:34:05.065 --> 00:34:05.865 align:middle line:90%
Or you can't--

00:34:05.865 --> 00:34:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Do you believe?

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --how--
are the two the same?

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.164 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: If we believe that it's
fear and it's the cortisol,

00:34:12.164 --> 00:34:15.810 align:middle line:84%
the doctors, and their limits,
and their explanations,

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:19.770 align:middle line:84%
even in science and
physics is nonsensical.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:22.270 align:middle line:84%
They're always going,
oh, this happened.

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:23.949 align:middle line:90%
And this was present.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:90%
So this had to be the cause.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.179 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I can look at it and say, do
we need to have cortisol to--

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do superhuman feats.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --stimulate it?

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:33.449 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:33.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: No.

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I believe that once it
comes into our consciousness--

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.929 align:middle line:90%
here's a good example.

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:48.750 align:middle line:84%
When I read the book,
"The Patanjali Aphorisms,"

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.840 align:middle line:84%
"Yoga Aphorisms," there
were all the things

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:57.660 align:middle line:84%
you could do after 10 years
of intensive yoga training.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I was very fortunate to
experience all of these two

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.970 align:middle line:90%
days after I read them.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.800 align:middle line:90%
And I was eating meat.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly wasn't doing
any kind of yogic stuff.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But when I attempted to do
it later out of curiosity,

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:17.290 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to,
but I was shown

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that we are capable of
doing all of these things.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you believe you
need 10 years of a yogi,

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.405 align:middle line:84%
then it's going
to take 10 years.

00:35:26.405 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.697 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: But the
transcendentalists

00:35:28.697 --> 00:35:32.300 align:middle line:84%
were hugging trees and getting
cosmic consciousness as

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.100 align:middle line:90%
opposed.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Yogic story.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Man, businessman, heavy duty
businessman wakes up one day

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.215 align:middle line:84%
and goes, what is
life all about?

00:35:41.215 --> 00:35:42.520 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So he says to one
of his partners.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They say, go to the
metaphysical bookstore.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:48.890 align:middle line:90%
They will have the answer.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:49.690 align:middle line:90%
So he goes.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And they go, you
need to go to Tibet.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Go to the yogis.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So this man flies,
goes to the Himalayas.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Wrong time of year.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Not dressed.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Collapses in the snow.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So when he wakes up, the
yogis are there, and they go,

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.700 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing here?

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I've come for
the secret of existence.

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Have I come to the right place?

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:90%
And they go, no.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well,
where do I need to go?

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.480 align:middle line:84%
They said, where
did you come from?

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And he mentioned,
your city, whatever.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And they said, that's
where the answer is.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.020 align:middle line:90%
It's always with you.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not outside.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not with anybody else.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.180 align:middle line:90%
It is with us.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So we want to believe
it takes 10 years,

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.490 align:middle line:90%
it's going to take 10 years.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:41.150 align:middle line:84%
You want to believe, which
I've seen someone burned

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:45.597 align:middle line:84%
in my presence with an iron, was
getting a blister, they joked.

00:36:45.597 --> 00:36:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you're supposed
to be the healer.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you do something?

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.310 align:middle line:90%
So I went over.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Was gone, but they
still had a pain.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Blew on it, the pain was gone.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.630 align:middle line:90%
No special.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't want people writing me.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.287 align:middle line:90%
I want them to understand.

00:37:03.287 --> 00:37:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do it ourselves.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Do yourself and
know that it is possible.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm probably a good
example because I'm a goofball.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.340 align:middle line:90%
I was in sports.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.450 align:middle line:90%
I eat meat.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy being with
the opposite sex--

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:23.150 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to be celibate
and only eat vegetarian

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.890 align:middle line:90%
if that's the belief.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:30.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the incredible Earth
plane era we live in, Regina,

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.390 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But PP Quimby, the great
healer, said, "Thought

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:39.490 align:middle line:90%
is like the aroma of a rose."

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:43.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the
aroma, but it permeates.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But understand, everybody's
rose auras or negative auras

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:90%
are coming upon us every second.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: They're permeating.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.870 align:middle line:90%
And can we stop it?

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Yes, if we're aware that we
may be feeling not bad within

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:07.120 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, but we're--
it's called pick up.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.100 align:middle line:84%
We're picking up the
energies of other people.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: We're picking
up their vibrations.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are everything.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And now there
was a great book

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:23.870 align:middle line:84%
many years, 30 years, the body
believes every word you say.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why is it then that
we have so much harder time

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.350 align:middle line:84%
healing ourselves
when-- even when

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:32.260 align:middle line:84%
you can work with healing
energy, as you do,

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and others, including
myself do with other people?

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And right before
I answer that question, I

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.340 align:middle line:84%
want to go back to
an experience I had

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.890 align:middle line:90%
when I was first in the field.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.860 align:middle line:84%
A very good friend of mine
called me up, a nurse,

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and said, our friend, Cindy,
she's in a bathtub now.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.190 align:middle line:90%
She's in excruciating pain.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Please, she does not want
to go into the hospital.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is coming from
a nurse friend, saying,

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to take
her to the hospital.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Please help her with the pain.

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:03.520 align:middle line:90%
So I go over.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And within minutes,
all the pain was gone.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:90%
And I was very proud of myself.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the voice goes, she's
got to go to the hospital

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:12.410 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So I said, you've got
to go to the hospital.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.650 align:middle line:90%
So they go into the hospital.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.438 align:middle line:84%
The hospital said,
30 minutes more and--

00:39:20.438 --> 00:39:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She'd have been dead.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Dead.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Now what happened?

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.820 align:middle line:90%
I just got rid of the pain.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The pain.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.320 align:middle line:84%
You didn't get rid
of the problem.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's exactly right.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
stuff is nuanced.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And we all-- every one of
us has to start playing

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:33.780 align:middle line:90%
with this in our own way.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing
is to understand,

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:39.230 align:middle line:84%
this capability actually is
going to become everyday stuff,

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.040 align:middle line:90%
not magic.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.650 align:middle line:84%
In our future incarnations,
which we're already

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:45.590 align:middle line:84%
leading into, this
will be everyday stuff

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.090 align:middle line:90%
that we, as a species, do.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:49.325 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: From the people
who are going to be open.

00:39:49.325 --> 00:39:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And I always would love
everybody to have these.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And I did not answer
your question,

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:58.123 align:middle line:84%
why we tend to always be
stronger in the negative--

00:39:58.123 --> 00:39:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In helping
someone else.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:00.675 align:middle line:90%
Than our own self.

00:40:00.675 --> 00:40:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Before ourselves.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why is that?

00:40:04.625 --> 00:40:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I can look
and be brutally honest

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.185 align:middle line:84%
and say, it's the
same thing with me.

00:40:11.185 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:90%
I have-- I'm in my 75th year.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
for a long time.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.380 align:middle line:90%
And I have things happen.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And I ask myself that because
there is a little bit of doubt.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But when I've analyzed
myself sometimes, I've said,

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.650 align:middle line:90%
do I deserve this?

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Do I deserve being able
to use this energy I have

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.710 align:middle line:90%
to help other people on myself?

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So despite studying
and being involved

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.930 align:middle line:84%
in working with thousands
of people, we're all human.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.360 align:middle line:90%
We live in a human body.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And I go through the same
things as other people do.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you do.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:56.900 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Because I know you.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:58.670 align:middle line:90%
I know you.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe this is part of it
too is this beauty in the fact

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:90%
that it is a circle.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.740 align:middle line:90%
We're all here together.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're all here
to help one another.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.350 align:middle line:10%
And to also have the
humility in ourselves to say,

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:12.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm not at my strongest.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me?

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:16.340 align:middle line:90%
And that is important.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So when-- because I don't want
people leaving the show, going,

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:20.380 align:middle line:90%
oh, my God.

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go to my doctor.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
listen to people.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:23.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to call Steven.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:24.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.565 align:middle line:84%
No, this is to restart
looking inside.

00:41:26.565 --> 00:41:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It's about balance.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.365 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Jesus was the balanced
middle way, the Buddhist,

00:41:32.365 --> 00:41:34.375 align:middle line:90%
the balanced path.

00:41:34.375 --> 00:41:39.640 align:middle line:10%
It is knowing when we should
or could be doing things

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.500 align:middle line:10%
and when we need assistance.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.890 align:middle line:84%
I have never joined
any group organization,

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.980 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean that I
don't find them interesting

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:90%
or have not taken things.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want to be
limited by the concepts of who

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.710 align:middle line:90%
we are listening to, working.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.500 align:middle line:84%
That is why-- and
you know the library.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a 20,000 volume library.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Research Foundation.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.200 align:middle line:84%
You're a library that has
books like these in it.

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I made a point
never to read these--

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.003 align:middle line:84%
two books in a row
by the same author.

00:42:12.003 --> 00:42:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Another--
read another one.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're just
reinforcing the belief then.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:17.695 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Over and over and over.

00:42:17.695 --> 00:42:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying
I didn't speed

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.790 align:middle line:84%
read the second one to get
back to the first, but it was--

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Emerson said, when I
find narrow viewpoints,

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.460 align:middle line:90%
I find narrow reading.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.870 align:middle line:90%
And that is exposure.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.510 align:middle line:90%
So what is the key?

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:34.100 align:middle line:90%
What's the underlying key?

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.770 align:middle line:90%
To be with positive people.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:41.750 align:middle line:84%
To not listen to the
freaking news and the TV hour

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:43.190 align:middle line:90%
after hour.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't like this.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- that's negative,
negative, negative, negative.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we wonder, well, how
come we can't be positive?

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.980 align:middle line:84%
How come we can't
heal ourselves?

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we're
bathing in a sea of negativity.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.488 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: We-- see,
that's beautiful.

00:42:57.488 --> 00:42:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Your audience is
lucky they have you.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.620 align:middle line:90%
But I think they know that.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They already
know this about themselves.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.375 align:middle line:84%
Most of them have quit
watching that stuff.

00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:06.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: But--

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.525 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: But that's the point.

00:43:08.525 --> 00:43:11.097 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One final question
because our time is up.

00:43:11.097 --> 00:43:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's just flown-- all
these things we didn't get to,

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.170 align:middle line:90%
goodness gracious.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:19.280 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
between belief and faith.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the explanation, if
you look at the encyclopedia

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.230 align:middle line:84%
or dictionary, would
be, with faith, it is--

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.540 align:middle line:90%
you know it's going to happen.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.210 align:middle line:90%
With belief, it's a belief.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:36.520 align:middle line:90%
You think it may happen.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's still
a little theoretical.

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.840 align:middle line:90%
You hope.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.520 align:middle line:10%
And that is why the three
edicts that the great alchemist

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.820 align:middle line:10%
Paracelsus, the greatest
mystic alchemist

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:51.320 align:middle line:10%
healer of all time, the three
keys to all manifestation,

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.130 align:middle line:10%
imagination, faith, and will.

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Picture what you
want to manifest.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Know-- he didn't say believe.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Know that it must
manifest, and the will

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to stay the course
until it does happen.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So what do I want to leave your
audience with, trust yourself.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Know these things are possible.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Immerse yourself and know
these are not rare occurrences,

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.620 align:middle line:90%
but they're there.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.080 align:middle line:84%
You do not need to be
jacked up with fear.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you just know
"Life and Teachings

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.960 align:middle line:84%
of the Masters of the Far
East" by Baird Spalding,

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.910 align:middle line:90%
five volume set.

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Read volume 1 to the half of
volume 2, about what people

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.770 align:middle line:90%
supposedly in India were doing.

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Why supposedly?

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:46.280 align:middle line:90%
They have investigated.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people say, hey,
he never met these masters.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:53.760 align:middle line:84%
He did in the internal realms,
who were passing information.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Listen to the spirits
around us, what is possible.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there's
nothing we can add to that.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Steven, thank you so much.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.880 align:middle line:84%
It's such a joy being
around you always.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you, Regina.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thank
you for bringing

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:11.300 align:middle line:84%
to us the absolute necessity
for us to begin having faith.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.545 align:middle line:90%
Faith knowing in ourselves.

00:45:13.545 --> 00:45:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And be happy.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And be happy.

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.778 align:middle line:84%

you again, Steven.
