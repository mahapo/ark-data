00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:21.690 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH:
Here at Gaia,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.180 align:middle line:10%
we've featured a number of
people who serve as channels

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle line:10%
for information coming from
higher source and sometimes

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.620 align:middle line:10%
even higher self.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.710 align:middle line:10%
Today we're speaking
with Paul Selig,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.000 align:middle line:10%
who became a channel after
a spiritual awakening

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.543 align:middle line:10%
over 30 years ago.

00:00:34.543 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:10%
Since then, he's written at
least a half a dozen channeled

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:10%
books.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:10%
And today, we'll be digging into
his newest, "Beyond the Known".

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:10%
Welcome, Paul.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:10%
It's been really fun sitting
here chatting off-camera

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:10%
with you for a while and
getting to know you personally

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:10%
a little bit.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:10%
And first of all, you're
very self-effacing.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:10%
You say when it comes to
what you do, you show up

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:10%
and you do the work
that is asked of you,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:10%
and other than that,
you're kind of a recluse.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:10%
And you're the Forrest
Gump of the duo.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:10%
You simply wait, and then
the information comes.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:10%
And so we're going to experience
that in a little while.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:10%
And because you're
the Forrest Gump,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be
talking with you first,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.282 align:middle line:10%
and obviously you've
learned a thing or two

00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:21.033 align:middle line:10%
through these channelings
all these years.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:10%
And so we'll chat a
little bit, and then we'll

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:10%
go into a channeling after that.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:10%
And for those who don't
already know your work,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:10%
tell us what
happened 30 years ago

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.872 align:middle line:10%
that kind of blasted you open.

00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:10%
>> PAUL SELIG: It was
a series of things.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:10%
But I was 25 years old.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.655 align:middle line:10%
I had had a list
of things that I

00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:40.530 align:middle line:10%
thought I needed to
achieve in the world that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:10%
would make me OK.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:10%
I got the whole list.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't OK.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:10%
I began to look
for something more,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:10%
really out of sheer necessity,
not because I thought it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.340 align:middle line:10%
would be nice to get spiritual.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:10%
I'd been raised pretty
much an atheist.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.100 align:middle line:10%
There was this thing happening
in 1987 called the Harmonic

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:10%
Convergence.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Oh, I remember it.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.843 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: People were
going to be waking up.

00:02:00.843 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, in my
naivete, I thought, well,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:10%
if there is a god or
something like a god

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:10%
and you ask to be
woken up to it,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.472 align:middle line:10%
why would it want to say no?

00:02:10.472 --> 00:02:12.180 align:middle line:10%
And I went up to the
roof of the building

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:10%
that I lived in the
night before this event,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:10%
and somebody had given me
a mantra and a crystal.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:10%
And I thought you
needed the props.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: All the tools.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: All the props.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.850 align:middle line:10%
And I went up there, and
I asked to be woken up.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:10%
And I think I asked from a place
of real sincerity and a belief

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:10%
that perhaps something
might happen.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:10%
And something did.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.750 align:middle line:10%
And it was an experience
of energy sort

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:10%
of moving through my body.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:10%
It began, now I would know,
at the base of the root,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:10%
and it just push,
push, pushed it out

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:10%
through the top of my
head and sort of left

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.018 align:middle line:10%
me swaying in this
energy on the roof.

00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:10%
And I always say,
you know, for all I

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.210 align:middle line:10%
know I was
hyperventilating up there.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.620 align:middle line:10%
Maybe that's what it was.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:10%
But I started seeing
little lights around people

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:10%
shortly thereafter.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:10%
And for me, who had been
raised with nothing,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:10%
it was a tangible
experience of energy.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.510 align:middle line:10%
And it came in a beautiful way.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:10%
And it gave me
something to trust,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:10%
and it became an anchor for
me after I began opening up

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:10%
as a clairaudient after
I studied healing,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:10%
which was a few years later.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:10%
And I found that when I had
my hands on people's bodies,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:10%
I could hear things for them.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:10%
I was volunteering at a center
for people who were living

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.575 align:middle line:10%
with life-challenging illness.

00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:10%
It was the height of the
AIDS epidemic in New York,

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:10%
and there were these pop-ups.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:10%
And I had my hands on somebody,
and I heard the name Frederick.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.870 align:middle line:10%
And I learned to say,
who is Frederick?

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.245 align:middle line:10%
And they'd say, well, that's
my father, or that's my son,

00:03:36.245 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:10%
or that's my dog.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:10%
And I began to trust
the transmission.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:10%
And that was the beginning
of a process, really,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:10%
of becoming a radio
for a transmission that

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.100 align:middle line:10%
now expresses itself in books.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And this
rooftop was in New York.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:10%
You're a New Yorker.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Yeah.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So I mean,
I went the distance.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:10%
I was at Mount Shasta.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:10%
We were all camped
out at Mount Shasta,

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.683 align:middle line:10%
and all waiting for these
transmissions like you.

00:04:02.683 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have anything
like that happen,

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:10%
but it was a lovely experience.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.722 align:middle line:10%
And so now you've
gone through this.

00:04:07.722 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:10%
But there was
something in you that

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:10%
had to have been in
enough pain that you

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:10%
were sincere in your requests.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Yeah.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: This wasn't--

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.469 align:middle line:10%
you weren't doing it lightly.

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I've never been much
of a dilettante, you know,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:10%
as a spiritual person.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:10%
I mean, my story was simple.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.157 align:middle line:10%
I was a playwright.

00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:10%
I was a year out of
graduate school at Yale.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:10%
I was getting produced
in New York and London.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:10%
Everything was going great.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.010 align:middle line:10%
And I was working on
an opera in Minnesota.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:10%
And I was being billeted a
lodge, with the Gopher Campus

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:10%
Motor Lodge, which
had a giant gopher

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.840 align:middle line:10%
on a spit outside the window.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know where
the drugs were in St. Paul,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:10%
and I actually remember that
the Gideons leave these books

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:10%
in drawers of hotel rooms.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:10%
And I pulled it out, and it said
prayer for people in crisis.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.318 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: What do you
think the crisis was?

00:04:57.318 --> 00:04:58.860 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: At the
time, I didn't know.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:10%
I knew that I was
having a bad time

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps it wasn't
going to change.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:10%
And I think in that
moment I realized

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:10%
that there was perhaps something
more that I had to apply to.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:10%
It was an existenstial crisis.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Totally existential.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.190 align:middle line:10%
And that was the beginning.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:10%
Three days later, I woke
up back in New York City,

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:10%
and I asked myself
what I could do

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:10%
for myself that was positive.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:10%
And I heard the first voice.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:10%
And that was the opening.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.747 align:middle line:10%
When I hear a
voice, I always have

00:05:25.747 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:10%
to say it's not like
somebody is whispering to me

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:10%
from the other side of a room.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:10%
It's like a thought
that pushes aside

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:10%
all other thoughts to
the forefront of my mind

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:10%
that has this quality of
truth that I can't deny,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:10%
and is almost always
not convenient to what

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:10%
I want to hear.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.480 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's interesting,
because as I've-- you know,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:10%
I've been doing
this for many years.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:10%
And as I sit with a
person for the first time

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:10%
and hear their stories and
such, one thing I've noticed

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:10%
is that a lot of times
it's men in their 20s

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:10%
that have been accomplished
that like, this isn't enough.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:10%
This isn't enough.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:10%
And there's just this
kind of ache for something

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.900 align:middle line:10%
they can't even put
their finger on.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:10%
It seems to come to women
in a slightly different way.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:10%
It enters the women who become
clairvoyants and channels

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:10%
differently, often unexpected,
and not necessarily sought.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Yeah.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.430 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: What is it in the
male character, you think,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.085 align:middle line:10%
that is this like, god,
I'm doing everything I can

00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:10%
and it's not enough?

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I have no idea.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:10%
I'll be honest with you.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.497 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I just find
it kind of interesting.

00:06:34.497 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I mean, I don't know
a lot of women channelers.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:10%
I have a lot of friends who
are very good psychics and very

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:10%
accomplished in that work.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.600 align:middle line:10%
And their intuitive skills
are through the roof.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.090 align:middle line:10%
My ability is as an empath
and always has been.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:10%
And I've done
everything that one

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:10%
can do in a life to
try to circumvent that,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:10%
to dull the receptivity.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:10%
And I think what happened to me
was I couldn't keep dulling it.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:10%
I had to begin to honor it.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.620 align:middle line:10%
And I think that there's
a yearning that most of us

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:10%
probably have for
something spiritual,

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:10%
even if we can't name it.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.240 align:middle line:10%
You know, from where I grew
up, it wasn't fashionable.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:10%
We went to therapy.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.820 align:middle line:10%
We didn't go to church.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.990 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't part of our world.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.910 align:middle line:10%
And so what I was doing
was completely crazy.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:10%
As far as all my
friends were concerned,

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:10%
this made no sense that I
should go on this journey.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.503 align:middle line:10%
And I've stayed on it
for a long time now.

00:07:30.503 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So I don't know
what your own beliefs are

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.378 align:middle line:10%
on the subject of the
cycle, wheel of life,

00:07:35.378 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:10%
and reincarnation and so forth.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:10%
But is it possible
that this is a skill

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.098 align:middle line:10%
that you have brought forward
from other times then?

00:07:42.098 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I believe that.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.640 align:middle line:10%
And the guides that
I work with have

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:10%
said that this isn't the first
time we've worked together.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:10%
And this is the
first time that I'm

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:10%
going to perhaps fully realize
what they've been teaching.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:10%
And I'm hopeful for that.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.540 align:middle line:10%
And I have some memories, and
they're not all very pleasant,

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.700 align:middle line:10%
from other times I've
done this kind of work.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:10%
I think we live in
a time now where

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:10%
people are more receptive
to the possibility for that.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:10%
That wasn't always the case.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of us who do this
work come from a history

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:10%
of slight remembrance.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:10%
Every time I take another
step, becoming more public

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:10%
with this work, I really
want to duck behind a tree,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.173 align:middle line:10%
because I still have
some memory of--

00:08:21.173 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: What's
happened before.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.965 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: What's
happened before.

00:08:23.965 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: A lot of people
have that same fear.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I understand, yeah.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.150 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Because the people
who are working on developing

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.322 align:middle line:10%
intuition are like, oh my
god, I'd love to do that.

00:08:34.322 --> 00:08:35.780 align:middle line:10%
But if you do have
a history of it,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.025 align:middle line:10%
no, you wouldn't
love to do that.

00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:39.900 align:middle line:10%
You want to keep your
head below the parapet.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:10%
And now you can't
do that anymore.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.010 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Exactly.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.667 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: In fact, you
just came back from Bahamas,

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:10%
and you're all over the place.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.957 align:middle line:10%
So, OK, let's go into this.

00:08:47.957 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about
a couple of the concepts

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:10%
that have come through
and that are in this book.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:10%
And one of them has to
do with upper rooms.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:10%
And explain this whole
notion of upper rooms,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.845 align:middle line:10%
and where the elevator stops
between floors, and so forth.

00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Well, the guides that
I work with, I should say this,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:10%
they dictate these books.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:10%
So there's like seven
of them in print.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:10%
They're all the
unedited transcripts.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:10%
And they've been talking
about this thing called

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:10%
the upper room for a little bit.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.540 align:middle line:10%
What they say is that we're
operating in a shared octave.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:10%
And that's the word they use,
a shared octave, of expression.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:10%
And an octave has high notes
and low notes, you know,

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.710 align:middle line:10%
and we're all contributing
to this idea of reality

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:10%
through the consciousness
that we hold.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.090 align:middle line:10%
It's a shared
construct of reality

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.733 align:middle line:10%
that holds a lot of prior data.

00:09:35.733 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:10%
What things have been--
what we've been taught

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.590 align:middle line:10%
things should mean.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:10%
What it means to be a man.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:10%
What it means to be spiritual.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:10%
You can name it.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:10%
But all of the
things that we see,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.140 align:middle line:10%
the guides say we are in
collective accord with.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:10%
And they use the term accord.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:10%
And they say a A-C-C-O-R-D,
or A C-H-O-R-D as on a piano,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:10%
as if it's vibration and tone.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:10%
So we're sharing this
collective octave.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:10%
And they say there
is an aspect of us.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.890 align:middle line:10%
They call it the true
self, or the divine self,

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.575 align:middle line:10%
or the Christ itself.

00:10:06.575 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
different names.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:10%
I suppose there's a
name for it probably

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:10%
in every system of
belief that you can find.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:10%
But they say the
true self, which

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:10%
is the truth of who we are
beyond the mask of identity,

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.730 align:middle line:10%
operates in what they
call the upper room.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.070 align:middle line:10%
And what the upper
room is is the octave

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:10%
above the collective,
the one we're used to.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:10%
And they explain it in
a simple way for me,

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:10%
which is they say every
song or every note

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.300 align:middle line:10%
can be played in a higher
octave into infinity.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:10%
You can't necessarily
hear it, but it doesn't

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.300 align:middle line:10%
mean that it doesn't exist.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:10%
And the process that
they're taking us through,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.030 align:middle line:10%
which is a bit trippy,
and they talk about it

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:10%
as re-articulation,
or transposing

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:10%
the vibration of who and what we
are, which is inclusive of form

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:10%
to operate in what they
call the upper room.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:10%
And this has been kind of
the holy grail of, I think,

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.290 align:middle line:10%
the whole new age
movement, new thought

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:10%
movement, all these movements
in the last 40 years.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:10%
That's kind of what people
are trying to get toward,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.753 align:middle line:10%
but this is not easy.

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:10%
And let me just
stop for a moment,

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.387 align:middle line:10%
because the upper
rooms, you could--

00:11:14.387 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:10%
and maybe in some
parlance it would be

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.160 align:middle line:10%
called densities or dimensions.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:10%
So we know that we're living
in this collective third slash

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.230 align:middle line:10%
fourth dimensional
representation of reality,

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.030 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:10%
And that we have this
other higher more

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.045 align:middle line:10%
refined aspect of
ourselves that lives,

00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:10%
you might say, in
the upper rooms

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:10%
or in a higher
dimensional field.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:10%
And the trick, exactly
what you're saying,

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:10%
is so timely right now
in our world today.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:10%
The trick to be able to merge
that knowing, that refinement

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness,
with physical life.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:10%
My husband always
says, which is it?

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:10%
Do you bring that down
into the fleshly reality,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.623 align:middle line:10%
or do you try to bring the
flesh reality up into it?

00:11:59.623 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to talk
quite a bit about this,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:10%
because it's not easy.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: It's not easy.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:10%
The guides have said we come
from a construct of belief

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:10%
where if there is a god
or something like a god,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.810 align:middle line:10%
it's up there in the clouds and
we're stuck here in the mud.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:10%
And they say, well,
God is the mud.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:10%
And it's also the
body you've taken.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:10%
And it's everything
that you can see.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:10%
They say that actually, the
only problem humanity has now,

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:10%
the only problem, is what they
call the denial of the divine.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:10%
Everything can be
brought down to that,

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:10%
which is denying the
divine in another, denying

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.520 align:middle line:10%
the divine in what you see.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.560 align:middle line:10%
And it's very hard
to accept the divine

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:10%
in what you see when it doesn't
appear the way you want it to.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: But what they say
is God is all things or it

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:10%
can't be anything at all.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:10%
They say what you put
in darkness calls you

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:10%
to that darkness.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:10%
There's no other way.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.680 align:middle line:10%
You can't be the light and
hold another in darkness.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:10%
They're simple teachings.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.220 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: But the idea of the
divine what, the divinist form,

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.863 align:middle line:10%
is a challenging teaching.

00:12:58.863 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:10%
The guides work
with these things,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.447 align:middle line:10%
they call them claims of
truth, and they're actually

00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:10%
energetic attunements.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:10%
And one of them
is, I know who I am

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.240 align:middle line:10%
in truth, which is, they
say, spoken by the true self.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:10%
It can't be spoken by
the personality self,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:10%
but the divine self
knows who it is.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:10%
And then the second claim is,
I know what I am in truth.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.160 align:middle line:10%
And the what is manifestation.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:10%
And it's an interesting thing.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:10%
When they first
brought that through

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.252 align:middle line:10%
and I asked what it meant, I
thought it meant in your life.

00:13:28.252 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:10%
You walk around, you're the
divine self in your life.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:10%
But they're really talking about
matter, the divine as form.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:10%
And they say if you're excluding
the divine in your own form,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:10%
you're also excluding the divine
in all things in physical form.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.513 align:middle line:10%
You can't have it both ways.

00:13:44.513 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:10%
And I think this is made evident
by the fact that people have

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:10%
written about their movies, and
films, and books, and reports,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.470 align:middle line:10%
and personal experience of
people having instant healings,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.940 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:10%
Instant transformations.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.270 align:middle line:10%
That couldn't happen
if the body weren't

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:10%
divine in nature, didn't have
all that already embedded

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:10%
within it, right?

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Exactly.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:10%
But they're teaching
us, I think,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:10%
and they're using these claims--

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:10%
they say what the claims
are are attunements.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.470 align:middle line:10%
They're like tuning the radios
that we are to play the higher

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:10%
broadcast that's already there.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:10%
And this is to
support us in aligning

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:10%
at that level of vibration.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:10%
And what they say
is when you align

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.010 align:middle line:10%
at that level of vibration,
which is inclusive of form,

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:10%
you become in some ways
a portal or a doorway

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.170 align:middle line:10%
between the octaves.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:10%
And by nature of
your presence, which

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:10%
means your field,
your energetic field,

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.670 align:middle line:10%
you can be lifting what
you encounter to what

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:10%
they call the upper room.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.130 align:middle line:10%
That's just entrainment.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:10%
Like attracts like.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.120 align:middle line:10%
So the one who lives
on the fifth floor

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:10%
can lift what's on
the lower floor to her

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.240 align:middle line:10%
by nature of being.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.040 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:10%
Lifting up into it.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.180 align:middle line:10%
OK, you mention in
your book, and you're

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.240 align:middle line:10%
kind of touching around
it right now, that it's

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.740 align:middle line:10%
hard to lift up
into something when

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:10%
you have a whole bunch of
weights hanging onto you.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:10%
How do you get your--
how do you give yourself

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:10%
that spiritual buoyancy?

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:10%
So they say you have to let
go before you can actually

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.050 align:middle line:10%
rise up.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:10%
You're in a conversation with
someone, or in a conversation

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:10%
even with a group
of people, and there

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:10%
is an increasing instance
of self-referencing,

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:10%
self-reference.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.540 align:middle line:10%
So you say something,
it's a given topic,

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:10%
and it's a large topic.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:10%
A person's going to take it
and immediately personalize

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.802 align:middle line:10%
it and self-reference
themselves into the story.

00:15:37.802 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:10%
And at first, I found it
just kind of annoying.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.330 align:middle line:10%
I thought, well, that's kind
of self-centered, you know,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:10%
judgmental.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:10%
And I started
realizing, no, it's

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:10%
people trying to find
something of themselves.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:10%
They're trying to find
something to hold on to.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:10%
So how do you--

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:10%
what does that feel
like to just let

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.610 align:middle line:10%
go of your perception of self?

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:10%
What's there?

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I can't say
that I've done it fully.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: What do they say
it's supposed to be like?

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Well, I'll go
to them if you want me to.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.370 align:middle line:10%
But I'll say this.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:10%
When I channel, I
whisper the words

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.865 align:middle line:10%
as they come and
repeat them, so you're

00:16:11.865 --> 00:16:12.990 align:middle line:10%
going to hear things twice.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:10%
It's not the most
graceful way one channels,

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:10%
but it's how it
comes through me.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:10%
But I can ask them
what it feels like

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:10%
or what it is as to
let go of the mask.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.513 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Now let
me ask you this.

00:16:23.513 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:10%
Can you go in and out
of the channeling?

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.330 align:middle line:10%
So once we go to them,
do we have to stay?

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:10%
Or can we go back and
forth a little bit?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.675 align:middle line:10%
You tell me how it
feels best for you.

00:16:32.675 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: When I'm channeling
and they're lecturing

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.510 align:middle line:10%
or they're doing a book, it's
like I'm sitting in the back

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:10%
seat of the car.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:10%
I turn the wheel over.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:10%
In conversation or
when I'm reading,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:10%
it's like I'm passing
the wheel back and forth.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:10%
So I can go back and forth.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:10%
I'm just not as fully receded.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK, since
we're in this moment,

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.138 align:middle line:10%
and this is a really
important topic,

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:54.930 align:middle line:10%
I think we should
probably go ahead and go.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:10%
And we'll see how it works
going back and forth, OK?

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:10%
OK, so what we're
talking about here then

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:10%
is most people can
imagine what it's

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:07.829 align:middle line:10%
like to not be them
through their filters,

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:10%
through their thoughts.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:10%
They would be
completely untethered.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.982 align:middle line:10%
So can you please
explain, welcome, welcome.

00:17:15.982 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: They're saying we
would like to teach this.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.650 align:middle line:10%
And it will not be
comfortable for either of you.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:10%
And it will not be
comfortable for either of you.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:10%
The self-reference
you speak to--

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:10%
the self-reference you
speak to-- is actually

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.550 align:middle line:10%
an abnegation-- is actually an
abnegation-- of the true self--

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:10%
of the true self-- the true
self as you truly are--

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:10%
the true self is
who you truly are.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:10%
The mask that you wear--

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.563 align:middle line:10%
the mask that you wear-- in
most ways-- in most ways--

00:17:37.563 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:10%
is accrued through history--

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.340 align:middle line:10%
is accrued through history--
who you think you should be--

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.788 align:middle line:10%
who you think you should be.

00:17:42.788 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:10%
What others should be for you--

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:10%
what others should be for you--
if you take away the should--

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.780 align:middle line:10%
if you take away the should--
which must always reference

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:10%
historical data--

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.407 align:middle line:10%
which must always
reference historical data--

00:17:52.407 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:10%
you have the divine self--

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:10%
you have the divine self--
who expresses in the present

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.570 align:middle line:10%
moment--

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:10%
who expresses in
the present moment--

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:10%
and operates in knowing--

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:10%
and operates in knowing.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:10%
The true self knows who she is.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.677 align:middle line:10%
The true self knows who she is.

00:18:04.677 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:10%
She is not seeking to
be seen a certain way.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:10%
She is not seeking to be
seen in a certain way.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:10%
He is not demanding to be
known as he think he should.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:10%
He is not demanding to be
known as he thinks he should.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.580 align:middle line:10%
But the true self in presence--
but the true self in presence--

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:10%
which is the divine as you--

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:10%
which is the divine as you-- has
a great claim for the world--

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:10%
has a great claim for the world.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:10%
The one who embodies
at this level--

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:10%
the one who embodies
at this level--

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:10%
becomes the benefactor
to all she sees--

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:10%
becomes the benefactor
to all she sees.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:10%
And by this, we simply mean--

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.630 align:middle line:10%
and by this, we simply mean--
that in her resonant field--

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:10%
that in her resonant field--
she lifts what she encounters--

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.630 align:middle line:10%
she lifts what she encounters--
to its own true nature--

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.625 align:middle line:10%
to its own true nature.

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:10%
In other words,
the divine self--

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:10%
in other words, the divine
self-- experiences and sees--

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:10%
experiences and sees-- the
divine in all manifestation--

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.113 align:middle line:10%
the divine in all manifestation.

00:18:54.113 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Through this level
of perception--

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.157 align:middle line:10%
through this level
of perception--

00:18:57.157 --> 00:18:58.740 align:middle line:10%
a world is lifted
to a higher accord--

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:10%
a world is lifted
to a higher accord.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.740 align:middle line:10%
they say the action of
fear is to claim more fear.

00:23:02.603 --> 00:23:05.020 align:middle line:10%
One of the things the guides
teach is, you know, they say,

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.450 align:middle line:10%
imagine you're going into--
you're walking up a mountain.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:10%

>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:27.353 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Now, because the
guides say the small self knows

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:10%
itself through history, that's
its only frame of reference is

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.510 align:middle line:10%
who she has been told she
has been, or what she thinks,

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:10%
or says, or did indeed happen.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.510 align:middle line:10%
Those frames of reference
seek replication.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.180 align:middle line:10%
The small self seeks
to replicate the idea

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:10%
of who it is into the future.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, the guides say
something, which

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:10%
is really challenging for me.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:10%
And they say, you
can't be a master

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.910 align:middle line:10%
and a victim at the same time.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:10%
And how do you just--

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is a big one.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:10%
I see people really hanging
on to victim stories.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:10%
This is not cool.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.490 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Well, I think--

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:10%
you see--

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I think it's
just holding us down.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.175 align:middle line:10%
It's part of that weight
that's holding us down.

00:24:08.175 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: The difference
is you're not denying that

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.470 align:middle line:10%
something happened.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:10%
You are releasing the
self-identification through it.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.580 align:middle line:10%

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:10%
That's the difference.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:10%

those sticky emotions to it

bad news, you know?

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:10%
So what else do they
want to say about this?

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm curious.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.370 align:middle line:10%
We'd like to talk.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:10%
They're saying we
would like to talk.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:37.120 align:middle line:10%
I'll go there.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:10%
We would like to say two things.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:10%
We would like to say two things.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:10%
History is an idea--

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.730 align:middle line:10%
history is an idea--

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:10%
finally an idea-- finally an
idea-- of what you think was--

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.260 align:middle line:10%
of what you think was.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:10%
The future is also an idea--

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:10%
the future is also an idea--
of what you think will be--

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:10%
of what you think will be.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:10%
In this present moment--

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.890 align:middle line:10%
in this present moment--
when you know who you are--

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:10%
when you know who you are-- you
know you are safe and well--

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:10%
you know you are safe and well.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:10%
The divine self as you--

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle line:10%
the divine self as you--
does not seek recrimination--

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:10%
does not seek recrimination--
does not seek to punish

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:09.430 align:middle line:10%
or harm--

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:10%
does not seek to punish or harm.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:10%
She knows who she is.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:10%
She knows who she is.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.907 align:middle line:10%
And because she is unafraid--
and because she is unafraid--

00:25:16.907 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:10%
she may claim a new
world into being--

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.060 align:middle line:10%
she may claim a new
world into being.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:10%
You do not deny what happened.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.750 align:middle line:10%
You do not deny what happened.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:10%
Anybody who takes an act--

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:10%
anybody who takes an act--
is accountable to the act--

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:10%
is accountable to the act.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.090 align:middle line:10%
That is karma, as
you understand it.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.540 align:middle line:10%
That is karma, as
you understand it.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.690 align:middle line:10%
But who and what you are--

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:10%
but who and what you are-- as
a true self-- as a true self--

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.520 align:middle line:10%
expresses beyond karma--

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:10%
expresses beyond karma-- and
expresses beyond the need--

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.610 align:middle line:10%
and expresses beyond the
need-- to replicate an idea--

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:10%
to replicate an idea--

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.840 align:middle line:10%
of who one is-- of who one
is-- or who another is--

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:10%
or who another is--
based on your precepts--

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.840 align:middle line:10%
based on your precepts-- or
ways of deciding for them--

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.698 align:middle line:10%
or ways of deciding
for them, period.

00:25:59.698 --> 00:26:00.990 align:middle line:10%
They're telling me to say this.

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.490 align:middle line:10%
So one of their
teachings-- and it's

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:10%
a challenging teaching because
they talk about lifting things

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:10%
to the upper room.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.750 align:middle line:10%
But they say you can't lift
an evil man to the upper room.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.550 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: No.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.845 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Because
you've made him evil.

00:26:11.845 --> 00:26:12.710 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It's a
frequency thing.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.002 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: That's the level
of alignment you've come to.

00:26:15.002 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:10%
And that level of alignment
holds you in the lower strata.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:10%
So I get the choice.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:10%
If I want a damn
somebody, I can do it,

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.543 align:middle line:10%
but I'm sitting right there with
him at that level of vibration.

00:26:24.543 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that's absolutely true.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:10%
And anybody that's watching
this right now knows it,

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:10%
myself included.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:10%
If you have an ill
thought of someone,

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.430 align:middle line:10%
there's a sticky, icky,
dense feeling around it.

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:10%
And you know it.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:10%
You can't deny it.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.110 align:middle line:10%
And if you-- yeah,
and so of course

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:10%
it's going to magnetize the
same energy to it towards you.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:10%
So OK, so one of the
things that seems

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:10%
has been challenging
for humanity,

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.580 align:middle line:10%
all throughout humanity,
and in these times,

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:10%
and maybe even more
so with all the noise,

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:10%
is that of listening
to our own higher voice

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:10%
because there's so
much noise coming in.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:03.057 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, I have my own way
of defining and listening.

00:27:03.057 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:10%
And each person has
to find their own.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:10%
Way but can you,
or they, give us

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:13.940 align:middle line:10%
an idea of maybe a
more universal way

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.660 align:middle line:10%
of knowing or tapping in to
that higher aspect of self,

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.992 align:middle line:10%
whether it be by a
feeling or whatever?

00:27:19.992 --> 00:27:21.450 align:middle line:10%
Because I know
we're all different.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.247 align:middle line:10%
We get our information
differently.

00:27:23.247 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Well, they say, you
know, the true self knows,

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.300 align:middle line:10%
and the small self thinks.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.100 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: And they invite
people to look at the difference

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.580 align:middle line:10%
between thinking and knowing.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:10%
So remember a time in
your life when you knew.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:10%
And when you've known
something, there

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.585 align:middle line:10%
was never a question attached.

00:27:37.585 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That's very
good, very clear and simple.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: It's very simple.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:10%
So let me see if they
want to add to that.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:10%
We would like to say one thing.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:10%
We would like to say one thing.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:10%
The whole teaching that
we are giving you--

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.127 align:middle line:10%
the whole teaching we are giving
you-- is about rearticulation--

00:27:49.127 --> 00:27:52.020 align:middle line:10%
is about rearticulation-- which
is re-knowing who you are--

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.870 align:middle line:10%
which is really
knowing who you are--

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:10%
and accessing the true self--
and accessing the true self,

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:10%
who operates in knowing-- and
is unafraid of the truth--

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.570 align:middle line:10%
and is unafraid of the truth--
unafraid of being seen--

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:10%
unafraid of being seen--
as the light she truly is--

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:10%
as the light she truly is.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:10%
As you counter the
darkness in yourself--

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.322 align:middle line:10%
as you counter the
darkness in yourself--

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:13.280 align:middle line:10%
as you lift beyond the
darkness you have held--

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.253 align:middle line:10%
as you lift beyond
the darkness you

00:28:15.253 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:10%
have held-- you
can support others

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:10%
in doing the same--
you can support others

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:10%
in doing the same.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.807 align:middle line:10%
You don't do this
through effort--

00:28:20.807 --> 00:28:22.340 align:middle line:10%
you don't do this
through effort--

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.757 align:middle line:10%
but through knowing
who they are--

00:28:23.757 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:10%
but through knowing
who they are.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:10%
The divine as you--

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:10%
the divine as you-- knows who
the divine is in another--

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.417 align:middle line:10%
knows who the divine
is in another--

00:28:31.417 --> 00:28:32.750 align:middle line:10%
regardless of how they present--

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.640 align:middle line:10%
regardless of how they present--

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:10%
what they have done--

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.910 align:middle line:10%
what they have done-- or what
you might think of them--

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:10%
or what you might think of
them-- as the true self--

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:10%
as the true self.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.330 align:middle line:10%
Now, the true self as
you-- now, true self

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:10%
as you-- recognizes the
divinity in everyone--

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.370 align:middle line:10%
recognizes the
divinity in everyone.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:50.660 align:middle line:10%
She cannot not do that.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.460 align:middle line:10%
She cannot not do that.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:10%
It is who she is.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.710 align:middle line:10%
It is who she is.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:10%
And that is true knowing--

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.017 align:middle line:10%
and that is true knowing--
and will continue to be--

00:28:58.017 --> 00:29:00.110 align:middle line:10%
and will continue to be.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And so this would
mean that it's really very

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:10%
important for each of us, when
we see the beauty in another

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.500 align:middle line:10%
person, to really reflect
that back, if possible,

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.750 align:middle line:10%
if we have a means
of articulating it.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:10%
Because we're so
insecure as a species,

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:10%
we don't listen
to our own voice.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of times,
we go into competition

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.530 align:middle line:10%
rather than trying to help
elevate the other person.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:22.700 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Yeah.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.260 align:middle line:10%
It's what-- I mean, it's
how we've been taught.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:10%
But I mean, what they say is
the true self isn't competing.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: No, ever.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: And they say
if you want to compete,

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.227 align:middle line:10%
if you want to enjoy running
a race and see who gets there

00:29:32.227 --> 00:29:34.770 align:middle line:10%
first, do it for the
joy of running the race.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: But your sense of
value can't be contingent

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.010 align:middle line:10%
on the outcome.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.010 align:middle line:10%
I mean, none of what the
guides teach through me

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:10%
I find to be terribly convenient
to the culture we operate in.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.275 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they say, you know,
the beggar and the king

00:29:51.275 --> 00:29:53.570 align:middle line:10%
are both learning
lessons of abundance,

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:10%
just in different ways.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:10%
And it's you that makes
one higher or better

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.470 align:middle line:10%
than the other.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:59.270 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: True.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: It's a
cultural construct.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.620 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And yet, the
thing that grips the beggar,

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.990 align:middle line:10%
the king, and most people
that are walking the face

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:09.020 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth, because we have
physical mortality attached

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:13.070 align:middle line:10%
to the lower mind, is
the fear of the unknown,

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.615 align:middle line:10%
afraid of letting go of who
we think we are because we

00:30:15.615 --> 00:30:17.990 align:middle line:10%
don't know what's out there
if we don't know what we are,

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.930 align:middle line:10%
and who we are, and our place
in the world, and our stories,

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:21.950 align:middle line:10%
and everything.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:25.730 align:middle line:10%
But in fact, whenever we do,
yourself and other people,

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:30.560 align:middle line:10%
whenever we do let go of the
known and just go for the ride,

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.370 align:middle line:10%
it's so much more
interesting and beautiful.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:35.520 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I agree with you.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.385 align:middle line:10%
I'm not always
there yet, you know?

00:30:37.385 --> 00:30:39.290 align:middle line:10%
I still worry too much.

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.763 align:middle line:10%
I still have-- and
the guides talk

00:30:41.763 --> 00:30:43.430 align:middle line:10%
about these things
as sort of like rocks

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:46.370 align:middle line:10%
that you keep in your
pockets, that are keeping you

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:10%
from lifting fully.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:10%
And what they're talking
about now, which is really

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.030 align:middle line:10%
getting trippy for
me, is what it means

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:10%
to let go of those things.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of those
things are really

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:10%
held in the nervous system.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.710 align:middle line:10%
They're held in the body memory.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:10%
It's the memory of fear,
the memory of pain,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:10%
the agreements that we have made
culturally to what should be.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:10%
And the releasing of
those is a very large act.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.620 align:middle line:10%
They say it happens
in the upper room.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.960 align:middle line:10%
You get to that
level of vibration,

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:10%
and then you can begin to
transmute at that level.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:18.850 align:middle line:10%
They're saying say this.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm surprised.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.265 align:middle line:10%
But the attunement
that they're working

00:31:21.265 --> 00:31:24.330 align:middle line:10%
with now, which will be the
attunement of the next book,

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.150 align:middle line:10%
which I'm assuming,
because that's

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.100 align:middle line:10%
how they bring them through--

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.940 align:middle line:10%
is the claim, behold,
I make all things new.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.240 align:middle line:10%
And they say that's
claimed by the divine self

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:10%
in manifestation, who is
not attached to history--

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Truly.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.620 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: --and can consequently
transmute it or release it.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:10%
And it's a powerful claim.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.680 align:middle line:10%
They do it in the workshops now.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:10%
And you can feel the
energy roll out like saves.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.150 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Say it again.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.415 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Behold, I
make all things new.

00:31:52.415 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That's
very beautiful.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:10%
It's very direct,
and it's very true.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:56.590 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Yeah.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.750 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK, so we're
starting to get an idea

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.080 align:middle line:10%
of what's possible.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.130 align:middle line:10%
The letting go in the
physical body part,

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.750 align:middle line:10%
the mind-spirit-body
link, I think,

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:10%
has really been misunderstood,
certainly in the Western world.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.460 align:middle line:10%
We're starting to get it now.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:18.470 align:middle line:10%
But tell us the depth
to which that is true,

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:10%
the depth to which these
traumas we've experienced,

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:10%
even the joys we've
experienced, are genuinely

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:26.228 align:middle line:10%
embedded in ourselves.

00:32:26.228 --> 00:32:28.520 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Let me get it from
them because that's beyond

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.210 align:middle line:10%
my stuff.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.990 align:middle line:10%
We would like to answer this.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:31.490 align:middle line:10%
We would like to answer this.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.123 align:middle line:10%
As you understand yourself--
as you understand yourself--

00:32:34.123 --> 00:32:35.540 align:middle line:10%
through history--
through history,

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.998 align:middle line:10%
you give great
credence to what has

00:32:36.998 --> 00:32:39.675 align:middle line:10%
happened-- you give great
credence to what has happened.

00:32:39.675 --> 00:32:41.300 align:middle line:10%
You embody at that
level of agreement--

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.550 align:middle line:10%
you embody at that
level of agreement.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:44.690 align:middle line:10%
The scars of history--

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.180 align:middle line:10%
the scars of history--
can be claimed by you--

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.030 align:middle line:10%
can be claimed by you-- as
a way of identifying self--

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.310 align:middle line:10%
as a way of identifying self.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, understand, friends--
now, understand, friends--

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:56.300 align:middle line:10%
you are not your scars--

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.700 align:middle line:10%
you are not your scars.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:10%
You are not your gender.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.905 align:middle line:10%
You are not your gender.

00:32:59.905 --> 00:33:01.280 align:middle line:10%
You are not what
happened to you.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.170 align:middle line:10%
You are not what
happened to you.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.250 align:middle line:10%
The frame that you hold--

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.760 align:middle line:10%
the frame that you hold--

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.560 align:middle line:10%
I am the victim--

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:10%
I am the victim-- the
one who was so harmed--

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:10%
the one who was so harmed--
calls to you everything you

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:12.230 align:middle line:10%
expect--

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.900 align:middle line:10%
calls to you
everything you expect--

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.830 align:middle line:10%
that frame to supply--

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.302 align:middle line:10%
that frame to supply.

00:33:17.302 --> 00:33:19.010 align:middle line:10%
You are always agreeing
to your reality--

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:21.860 align:middle line:10%
you are always agreeing
to your reality--

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:10%
at whatever level you choose--
at whatever level you choose.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.150 align:middle line:10%
To re-identify beyond the old--

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.450 align:middle line:10%
to re-identify beyond
the old-- is the process

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:10%
of re-articulation-- is the
process of re-articulation--

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.440 align:middle line:10%
which is the manifestation
of the divine--

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.660 align:middle line:10%
which is the manifestation
of the divine--

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.910 align:middle line:10%
that has come as each of you--

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.630 align:middle line:10%
that has come as each of you.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.282 align:middle line:10%
Re-articulation--
re-articulation--

00:33:42.282 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:10%
which is the manifestation
of the divine self--

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.640 align:middle line:10%
which is the manifestation
of the divine self--

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.720 align:middle line:10%
in an embodied state--

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:10%
in an embodied state--
transmutes and reclaims--

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.960 align:middle line:10%
transmutes and reclaims--
the agenda of history--

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:10%
the agenda of history--

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:10%
the idea of what happened--
the idea of what happened--

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.140 align:middle line:10%
the ways you have
thought yourself to be--

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.840 align:middle line:10%
the ways you have
thought yourself to be.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.420 align:middle line:10%
The gift of the teaching--
the gift of the teaching--

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.710 align:middle line:10%
is the resurrected self--

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:10.070 align:middle line:10%
is the resurrected self-- who
does not operate in fear--

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:13.370 align:middle line:10%
who does not operate in fear--
does not operate in shame--

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.610 align:middle line:10%
does not operate in shame--
and does not self-identify--

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.165 align:middle line:10%
and does not self-identify--

00:34:18.165 --> 00:34:20.540 align:middle line:10%
through the fear that she has
been taught to believe in--

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.149 align:middle line:10%
through the fear that she has
been taught to believe in.

00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.949 align:middle line:10%
Period.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:25.250 align:middle line:10%
They're saying period.

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.239 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:10%
Let's take it even denser now.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:28.580 align:middle line:10%
Let's go dense.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.239 align:middle line:10%
Let's go right down into this
dimension-- food, the amount

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.949 align:middle line:10%
of beliefs around food.

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:38.339 align:middle line:10%
And now, it's becoming ever
more kind of splintered.

00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:10%
And that's good.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.440 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I know our
bodies are changing,

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.219 align:middle line:10%
so we're accepting
food on some levels

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.710 align:middle line:10%
differently because we're
energetically changing.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.040 align:middle line:10%
But the belief
systems around food--

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.199 align:middle line:10%
Let me just give
you one example.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:54.110 align:middle line:10%
A friend tells me of this man
she'd gone to the conference.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.580 align:middle line:10%
He was one of the people there.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.470 align:middle line:10%
And he said, I love sweets.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.820 align:middle line:10%
I live on sweets.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.140 align:middle line:10%
And all he ate were
desserts, mounds of desserts.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.770 align:middle line:10%
And he looked very, very
young, very, very energetic,

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:07.795 align:middle line:10%
and was going about his
life as a master would,

00:35:07.795 --> 00:35:09.170 align:middle line:10%
in the truest
sense of the word--

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:10%
just that's what I like to eat.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.280 align:middle line:10%
So someone else would
say, oh, my god,

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:10%
you have Snickers for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:10%
What happens with our
belief about food.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:24.290 align:middle line:10%
Because now we're down-- we're
in vegan, vegetarianism, paleo,

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.960 align:middle line:10%
carnivore, each one
saying this is the way.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.750 align:middle line:10%
And then we attach
our beliefs to it.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:10%
Can you talk about our
mind matrix and food

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.970 align:middle line:10%
and what this is doing?

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.970 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I'll ask them
because it's-- you know,

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:38.510 align:middle line:10%
it's one of my issues.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.260 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It's
such a a big deal.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:39.920 align:middle line:10%
It's everyone's issue.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: We would
like to teach this--

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:10%
we would like to teach this--
if, in fact, we are allowed--

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.180 align:middle line:10%
if, in fact, we are allowed.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.320 align:middle line:10%
The idea of the body--

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.780 align:middle line:10%
the idea of the body-- is
supported by the science

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.740 align:middle line:10%
of the times you hold--

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.890 align:middle line:10%
is supported by the science
of the times you hold--

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:10%
which is indeed limited--

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.290 align:middle line:10%
which is indeed limited.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.660 align:middle line:10%
Now everything is in vibration.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.040 align:middle line:10%
Now everything is in vibration.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.270 align:middle line:10%
Anything that you ingest--

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:00.710 align:middle line:10%
anything that you ingest--

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:02.690 align:middle line:10%
is actually aligned--
is actually aligned--

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:04.640 align:middle line:10%
to the system you
imbibe it through--

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.680 align:middle line:10%
to the system that
you imbibe it through.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.800 align:middle line:10%

the inherent divine--
in anything you eat--

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.450 align:middle line:10%
in anything you eat--
lifts the vibration--

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.830 align:middle line:10%
lifts the vibration.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.120 align:middle line:10%
You may name it what you wish.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.980 align:middle line:10%
You may name it what you wish.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.120 align:middle line:10%
You may eat the animal--

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.080 align:middle line:10%
you may eat the animal--
if you are called

to-- if you are called to.

00:36:38.622 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:10%
You may choose the name
of a diet, if you wish.

But until you realize--

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.275 align:middle line:10%
but until you realize--

00:36:46.275 --> 00:36:47.900 align:middle line:10%
that what you eat--
that what you eat--

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.610 align:middle line:10%
must be reknown as of god--

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:10%
must be reknown as of
god-- you will have dis--

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.920 align:middle line:10%
will have dis-resonance--

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.470 align:middle line:10%

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.670 align:middle line:10%

it-- and be harmed by--

and be harmed by.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.520 align:middle line:10%
So I'm just going to ask,
is this basically blessing

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:04.970 align:middle line:10%
your food?

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:10%
Yes, and more.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.858 align:middle line:10%
Yes, and more.

00:37:06.858 --> 00:37:08.900 align:middle line:10%
But to bless something--
but to bless something--

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.700 align:middle line:10%
without realizing
what a blessing is--

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.130 align:middle line:10%
without realizing
what a blessing is--

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:10%
means very little--
means very little.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.385 align:middle line:10%
To bless anything--
to bless anything--

00:37:17.385 --> 00:37:19.010 align:middle line:10%
is to claim it in
the presence of god--

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.500 align:middle line:10%
is to claim it in
the presence of god--

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.760 align:middle line:10%
the source of all things--

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.290 align:middle line:10%
the source of all things.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.400 align:middle line:10%
God is the food you eat.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.930 align:middle line:10%
God is the food you eat.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:28.250 align:middle line:10%
It is also what you expel--

it is also what you expel--

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:31.970 align:middle line:10%
after eating-- after eating.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.680 align:middle line:10%
There is one source
of all things.

There is one source
of all things.

00:37:35.935 --> 00:37:37.310 align:middle line:10%
You can name it
any way you wish.

have proper blessing look

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:01.993 align:middle line:10%

and what is not

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:19.310 align:middle line:10%
is a blessing to my being--

is a blessing to my being.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.970 align:middle line:10%
As I am blessed by what I eat--

>> REGINA: And then there's
this philosophical conflict that

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.030 align:middle line:10%
people have because
animals have lives.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:52.190 align:middle line:10%
They have their own
soul or group souls.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:55.910 align:middle line:10%
And then to ingest
animals, you know,

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.800 align:middle line:10%
and the guilt people
feel, then they're

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.520 align:middle line:10%
drawn to do so for grounding
or whatever purpose, can they

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.880 align:middle line:10%
speak a little bit to
the notion of how it is,

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:10%
this relationship between
animals, and eating animals,

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.970 align:middle line:10%
and being human?

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:10.970 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I'll go there.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:13.370 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what they've said
in the past about this--

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.230 align:middle line:10%
because people will
often ask the guides,

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.820 align:middle line:10%
what should we be
eating and whatever.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.500 align:middle line:10%
And they're saying
there are no rules.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:18.980 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.688 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: You know,
that's the challenge.

00:39:20.688 --> 00:39:22.910 align:middle line:10%
You all want this system
that you can abide by.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:25.850 align:middle line:10%
And they say, a
discipline or a system

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.940 align:middle line:10%
can be helpful until it
becomes a limitation.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.400 align:middle line:10%
But you have to operate
as you are moved

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.440 align:middle line:10%
to at the level of spirit.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.588 align:middle line:10%
So let me see what they
want to say about this.

00:39:35.588 --> 00:39:37.921 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Just about the
spiritual relationship between

00:39:37.921 --> 00:39:38.180 align:middle line:10%
us and animals.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.110 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: If you realize
the inherent divinity

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.160 align:middle line:10%

the inherent divinity--
the inherent divinity--

to eat it--

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.530 align:middle line:10%
and you are responsible
to your choice to eat it--

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:51.660 align:middle line:10%
you are claiming an identity--
you are claiming an identity.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.490 align:middle line:10%
I am the one--

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.530 align:middle line:10%
I am the one-- who
chooses to do this--

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.150 align:middle line:10%
who chooses to do this.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:57.800 align:middle line:10%
As long as you know
your own choice--

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.870 align:middle line:10%
as long as you know
your own choice--

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.190 align:middle line:10%
with any action that you take--

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.648 align:middle line:10%
with any action
that you take-- you

00:40:02.648 --> 00:40:04.107 align:middle line:10%
are accountable to
the choice-- you

00:40:04.107 --> 00:40:05.490 align:middle line:10%
are accountable to the choice.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.823 align:middle line:10%
We don't make it right or wrong.

00:40:06.823 --> 00:40:08.580 align:middle line:10%
We don't make it right or wrong.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.380 align:middle line:10%
You do.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.130 align:middle line:10%
You do.

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.850 align:middle line:10%
Say this if you wish.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:12.350 align:middle line:10%
They're telling me
to say this if you

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:13.990 align:middle line:10%
wish because one of the
things the guides have said

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.448 align:middle line:10%
through me in the
past is well, you

00:40:15.448 --> 00:40:18.260 align:middle line:10%
don't kill what you
know to be holy.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.962 align:middle line:10%
So I'm just going to
ask what that means.

00:40:20.962 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:10%
The plant is also holy.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.840 align:middle line:10%
The plant is also holy.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.070 align:middle line:10%
You are claiming the plant--

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.990 align:middle line:10%
you are claiming the plant--
for your meal-- for your meal.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.540 align:middle line:10%
But it is of god,
as is the animal.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.880 align:middle line:10%
It is of god, as is the animal.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.140 align:middle line:10%
All things are of god.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.640 align:middle line:10%
All things are of god.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.900 align:middle line:10%
What you put out of god--

you call to that shadow--
with you-- with you.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:47.022 align:middle line:10%
You deny god-- you deny god-- in
what you do-- in what you do--

00:40:47.022 --> 00:40:48.980 align:middle line:10%
and then you want to pat
yourself on the back--

yourself on the back--

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.560 align:middle line:10%
for the high choice
you have made.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.450 align:middle line:10%
If the divine is in

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:33.050 align:middle line:10%
comprehend as reality-- that
you comprehend as reality.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:10%
And you make choices
and assumption--

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.650 align:middle line:10%
and you make choices
and assumption--

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.660 align:middle line:10%
of the rules you would
like to have played out--

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.013 align:middle line:10%
of the rules you would
like to have played out.

00:41:41.013 --> 00:41:42.680 align:middle line:10%
We are not telling
you to not eat meat--

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.440 align:middle line:10%
we are not telling you not to
eat meat-- or to eat meat--

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.240 align:middle line:10%
or to eat meat.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.323 align:middle line:10%
We are saying you are
accountable to your choices.

00:41:48.323 --> 00:41:50.510 align:middle line:10%
We are saying you are
accountable to your choices.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:52.260 align:middle line:10%
It is you who make
things right and wrong.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.420 align:middle line:10%
It is you who make
things right or wrong.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.220 align:middle line:10%
We do not.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.480 align:middle line:10%
We do not, period,
period, period.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.440 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But you see
what I'm saying is,

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.780 align:middle line:10%
these are other beings that
have a right to life too

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.822 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:42:03.822 --> 00:42:06.540 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I mean, I've been
through this back and forth.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.980 align:middle line:10%
But they have a
right to life too.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.780 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I agree.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.250 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And they
are of the same divine.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.670 align:middle line:10%
So at what point do
we have the right

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.770 align:middle line:10%
to cut off the life
of anything else

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:17.500 align:middle line:10%
to sustain our physical bodies?

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.950 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is a big one.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:19.220 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: It's a
really good question.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.678 align:middle line:10%
It's a choice the
individual makes.

00:42:20.678 --> 00:42:22.900 align:middle line:10%
It's a choice the
individual makes--

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.700 align:middle line:10%
at the level of consciousness--
at the level of consciousness--

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.900 align:middle line:10%
he or she has aligned to--

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.520 align:middle line:10%
he or she has aligned to.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.520 align:middle line:10%
The one who has moved
beyond the need for meat--

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.870 align:middle line:10%
the one who has moved
beyond the need for meat--

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:34.040 align:middle line:10%
will no longer eat it--

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.475 align:middle line:10%
will no longer eat it.

00:42:35.475 --> 00:42:36.350 align:middle line:10%
She will not want it.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:37.730 align:middle line:10%
She will not want it.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.980 align:middle line:10%
To mandate that
someone not do this--

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.160 align:middle line:10%
to mandate that someone not
do this-- not eat meat--

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.200 align:middle line:10%
not eat meat-- that is
not at that level of--

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.060 align:middle line:10%
that is not at that
level of alignment--

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.620 align:middle line:10%
is actually prohibitive--
is actually prohibitive--

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:10%
a restriction--

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.210 align:middle line:10%
a restriction-- and the
denial of free will--

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:54.792 align:middle line:10%
and the denial of free will.

00:42:54.792 --> 00:42:56.000 align:middle line:10%
When the will that you hold--

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.760 align:middle line:10%
when the will that you hold--
the individual will that you

00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.560 align:middle line:10%
hold--

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.398 align:middle line:10%
the individual will
that you hold--

00:43:01.398 --> 00:43:02.690 align:middle line:10%
is aligned to the divine will--

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:05.480 align:middle line:10%
is aligned to the divine will--
you'll be very surprised--

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.150 align:middle line:10%
you'll be very surprised-- at
what actions you are choosing

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.950 align:middle line:10%
to take--

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.400 align:middle line:10%
at what actions you
are choosing to take--

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.100 align:middle line:10%
and, in fact, how
you may change--

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.200 align:middle line:10%
and, in fact, how
you may change--

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.880 align:middle line:10%
what you have become
accustomed to--

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.230 align:middle line:10%
what you have become
accustomed to, period.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.340 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So really, part
of this process of blessing,

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.790 align:middle line:10%
recognizing the divinity,
listening to the body and what

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:29.570 align:middle line:10%
it's asking for, it can start
elevating itself in terms

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.817 align:middle line:10%
of its own desires
over time as well?

00:43:31.817 --> 00:43:32.650 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I get yes.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:33.150 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.940 align:middle line:10%
OK, interestingly--

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:34.640 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: It's a process, yeah.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.473 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Because we
see ourselves as such,

00:43:36.473 --> 00:43:39.260 align:middle line:10%
we would not want to be
eaten by another species.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.330 align:middle line:10%
That would not be acceptable
to us as human beings.

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:45.080 align:middle line:10%
Yet we expect it to be--

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:45.920 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I agree.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.738 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: --acceptable to
other species on some level.

00:43:48.738 --> 00:43:50.780 align:middle line:10%
So I think this is a really
hard one for humanity

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.010 align:middle line:10%
right now, as people are
trying to go in and out,

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.520 align:middle line:10%
do the right thing, lift their
frequencies so that they can

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.360 align:middle line:10%
get closer to their true self.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.720 align:middle line:10%
I must be vegan to do this.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.890 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I've done
all of it, you know.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:02.190 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Yeah.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.148 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But it's a
point of great confusion.

00:44:04.148 --> 00:44:05.810 align:middle line:10%
And also, our
digestive systems seems

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.220 align:middle line:10%
to be rebelling en masse
against almost all of it.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.020 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I agree.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.478 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Is it because of
confusion or because our bodies

00:44:11.478 --> 00:44:13.310 align:middle line:10%
are intrinsically
going through a change?

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.210 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Everything
is changing.

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.413 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:17.413 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:10%
Care to elaborate any more?

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.580 align:middle line:10%
Our digestive
systems are actually

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.920 align:middle line:10%
now going through a change
also as human species--

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.920 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: The entire body
is at a higher octave.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.150 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, the body is acclimating
to a higher octave.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:10%
And what the body has held--

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.210 align:middle line:10%
and what the body has
held-- that operates in fear

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.650 align:middle line:10%
of darkness-- that operates
in fear and darkness--

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.330 align:middle line:10%
must be reknown
in a higher way--

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.910 align:middle line:10%
must be reknown in a higher way.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:42.720 align:middle line:10%
If ingesting low vibration--
if ingesting low vibration--

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.400 align:middle line:10%
is claiming the body in accord--

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.287 align:middle line:10%
is claiming the body in accord--

00:44:46.287 --> 00:44:48.870 align:middle line:10%
you will have to release that--
you will have to release that.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:50.662 align:middle line:10%
But the individual
knows what she requires.

00:44:50.662 --> 00:44:53.130 align:middle line:10%
But the individual
knows what she requires.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:54.540 align:middle line:10%
We cannot say one size fits all.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.658 align:middle line:10%
We cannot say one
size fits all, period.

00:44:56.658 --> 00:44:58.950 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So in that sense,
the body probably has more

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.448 align:middle line:10%
intelligence than our heads
and all ideas we're trying to--

00:45:01.448 --> 00:45:02.490 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I hear correct.

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:03.990 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: --live
out ideologically.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.230 align:middle line:10%
Good.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.813 align:middle line:10%
We'll leave that one
because it's just

00:45:05.813 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:10%
a point of so much pain
and confusion for people.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.000 align:middle line:10%
Let's go to the notion of
institutions for a moment.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.380 align:middle line:10%
Our world is-- our
institutions are breaking down.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:21.390 align:middle line:10%
Once you had philosophical-- you
have great philosophical minds,

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:24.190 align:middle line:10%
Plato and others, teaching
their students under the stars.

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:26.748 align:middle line:10%
And everything was whole.

00:45:26.748 --> 00:45:28.290 align:middle line:10%
There was a holistic
way of thinking.

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:31.410 align:middle line:10%
And now you have institutions
where knowledge is partitioned

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:35.860 align:middle line:10%
and spoonfed at different age
grades only for memorization

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:36.660 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.040 align:middle line:10%
That's education.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:41.490 align:middle line:10%
But that seems to be also
how most of our institutions

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:43.080 align:middle line:10%
are working.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.190 align:middle line:10%
What is going on?

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:47.160 align:middle line:10%
As you say, all things are
changing, creating terror.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.130 align:middle line:10%
What is happening with
this industrial age

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.470 align:middle line:10%
compartmentalization
of everything,

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.300 align:middle line:10%
to where it's no longer whole?

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.205 align:middle line:10%
What has to happen in order
to become whole again?

00:45:57.205 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I'm going to ask.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:45:59.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to ask.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.430 align:middle line:10%
I want to say first, you now,
I was an academic for 25 years.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:03.995 align:middle line:10%
I taught at NYU,
and I'm an educator.

00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:05.370 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And no
offense to you.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:05.520 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: No.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.300 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: But you
know what I mean--

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.380 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I do
know what you mean.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:07.620 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Little kids being--

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.470 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: But I'm a progressive
educator and always was.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.740 align:middle line:10%
And the progressive educator
is aware of the innate learning

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.000 align:middle line:10%
needs of the student.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.660 align:middle line:10%
People learn in different ways.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.030 align:middle line:10%
And one size, again,
doesn't fit all.

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:23.257 align:middle line:10%
So how do we sort of reunite
all of the compartmentalization?

00:46:23.257 --> 00:46:25.090 align:middle line:10%
Compartmentalization
is an interesting term.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:26.940 align:middle line:10%
They're saying,
compartmentalization

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.380 align:middle line:10%
is an interesting term.

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.840 align:middle line:10%
It actually claims things
in separation-- it actually

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.790 align:middle line:10%
claims things in separation.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.450 align:middle line:10%
Until the individual realizes--
until the individual realizes--

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.800 align:middle line:10%
what unity means-- what unity
means-- she will continue

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.920 align:middle line:10%
to manifest separation--
she will continue

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.570 align:middle line:10%
to manifest separation.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.660 align:middle line:10%
An ideologue-- an ideologue--
one who says this is what

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.500 align:middle line:10%
things should be--

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.200 align:middle line:10%
one who says this is
what things should be--

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.690 align:middle line:10%
will seek agreement--
will seek agreement--

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:52.860 align:middle line:10%
for his or her ideas--

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.667 align:middle line:10%
for his or her ideas.

00:46:54.667 --> 00:46:57.000 align:middle line:10%
The one who decides what a
government should look like--

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.167 align:middle line:10%
the one who decides what a
government should look like--

00:47:00.167 --> 00:47:01.500 align:middle line:10%
will mandate, let others agree--

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.630 align:middle line:10%
will mandate, let
all others agree.

>> REGINA: Now, what I'm
about to say, I know,

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.398 align:middle line:10%
can push some
buttons and so forth.

00:50:04.398 --> 00:50:05.940 align:middle line:10%
But it is very
interesting because it

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.950 align:middle line:10%
had to do with a report I read.

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:11.970 align:middle line:10%
But I think at large it speaks
to what you're talking about.

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:17.610 align:middle line:10%
And that is the notion of
to conserve is conservatism.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.190 align:middle line:10%
We have a big rift between
progressive and conservative

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.450 align:middle line:10%
in the country.

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:22.530 align:middle line:10%
And this whole notion--

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:24.220 align:middle line:10%
in our country and
around the world.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.050 align:middle line:10%
It's happening everywhere.

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.620 align:middle line:10%
And so, again, it
seems to me that this

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:34.170 align:middle line:10%
is an archetypal time,
historically, of needing

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:35.670 align:middle line:10%
to let go of the past.

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:39.240 align:middle line:10%
To conserve as to try
to maintain, maintain

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.960 align:middle line:10%
ideas, maintain ways
of life, maintain

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.210 align:middle line:10%
the way the population
looks and feels,

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:middle line:10%
boundaries, borders,
and everything.

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:52.740 align:middle line:10%
We're not in a time that
supports conservatism.

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.410 align:middle line:10%
It seems to me we're in
a time of letting go.

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:56.210 align:middle line:10%
How--

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.000 align:middle line:10%

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:04.260 align:middle line:10%
Change happens.

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.930 align:middle line:10%
Change comes-- change comes--
at the cost of the old--

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.460 align:middle line:10%
at the cost of the old.

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.350 align:middle line:10%
The small self knows
herself though history.

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:12.870 align:middle line:10%
The small self knows
herself through history.

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:14.850 align:middle line:10%
She will seek to maintain
an idea of self--

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:17.205 align:middle line:10%
she will seek to maintain
an idea of self--

00:51:17.205 --> 00:51:19.080 align:middle line:10%
at the cost of what
would come in its place--

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:10%
at the cost of what
would come its place.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:22.050 align:middle line:10%
Use this example.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:22.290 align:middle line:10%
It's good.

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:23.640 align:middle line:10%
They're saying use this example.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.015 align:middle line:10%
And an example
they're showing me

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:26.880 align:middle line:10%
is somebody who's in
a terrible marriage.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.770 align:middle line:10%
It's just not working.

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:33.390 align:middle line:10%
But the fear of being without
how he or she has defined

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.340 align:middle line:10%
him or herself in
the marriage is

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:39.660 align:middle line:10%
so terrifying, people
will maintain the worst,

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.540 align:middle line:10%
as opposed to claim the
possibility for the new.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:44.568 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I was just
proofing the newest book.

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:46.860 align:middle line:10%
And there was something in
there where the guides said,

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.260 align:middle line:10%
you know, how do you
operate in a time

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.940 align:middle line:10%
where everything is unknown,
where those no certainty?

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:52.980 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And
everything's changing.

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.355 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Everything
is changing.

00:51:54.355 --> 00:51:57.030 align:middle line:10%
And they say, well,
you basically--

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:58.590 align:middle line:10%
you don't try to control it.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:51:59.700 align:middle line:10%
You show up.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:04.710 align:middle line:10%
And they say the way is
lit as you step forward.

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:07.413 align:middle line:10%
You can't make it the way
you want to be anymore.

00:52:07.413 --> 00:52:08.580 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And this is the--

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:09.240 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I don't think
it's going to happen.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.698 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's the
archetypal battle we're seeing,

00:52:11.698 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:10%
people who don't want to let go
because that's what they know.

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:15.970 align:middle line:10%
That's what's comforting.

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:18.330 align:middle line:10%
And the unknown is everything.

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:20.130 align:middle line:10%
Everything out there
is the unknown.

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:22.980 align:middle line:10%
And so I can understand
it on a deep heart level.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:26.100 align:middle line:10%
It's just causing
so much division

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.700 align:middle line:10%
that's being fomented around
the world between people who

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.230 align:middle line:10%
don't want to let
go and those who

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:32.880 align:middle line:10%
want to try to find a new way.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.830 align:middle line:10%
It's really down to
that, nothing more.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:37.830 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I think you can
even simplify it more to say,

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:40.888 align:middle line:10%
if you want to deny the
divine or the presence of god,

00:52:40.888 --> 00:52:42.930 align:middle line:10%
whatever you want to call
it-- if there is a god,

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.060 align:middle line:10%
if you want to go there
and say, well, there is,

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:48.830 align:middle line:10%
then it must be in even
the person you can't stand.

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:50.340 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.850 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: And if
you can go there,

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:54.900 align:middle line:10%
you can find great
potential, and great change,

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:56.520 align:middle line:10%
and great beauty.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.950 align:middle line:10%
But the guides keep saying
you can't be the light

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:00.660 align:middle line:10%
and hold another in darkness.

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:04.680 align:middle line:10%
And I find it the height
of hypocrisy in religion

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.893 align:middle line:10%
that people do that, and in
government and everything else.

00:53:07.893 --> 00:53:08.810 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:11.460 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: I mean, the guides
I work with say, you know,

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.470 align:middle line:10%
you are your brother's keeper.

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:14.430 align:middle line:10%
You really are.

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:15.730 align:middle line:10%
You're accountable to this.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:16.530 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:19.890 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: So you know, we have
great opportunity now if we

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:21.090 align:middle line:10%
take it.

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:25.530 align:middle line:10%
And they're teaching this
a way, perhaps, to do that.

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.800 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: We have to have the
courage to let go of our story

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.450 align:middle line:10%
and our story about
everybody else.

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:32.930 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Yes, exactly.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:36.100 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: You know that's,
kind of a perfect place to end.

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.540 align:middle line:10%
And I love the message about you
can't hold others in darkness

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.940 align:middle line:10%
without going there yourself.

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:44.500 align:middle line:10%
I think that's just
simple, direct, and true.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.700 align:middle line:10%
And when it comes to being able
to listen to our higher self,

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:51.120 align:middle line:10%
to understand that we've all
had these moments of knowing,

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.380 align:middle line:10%
and those knowing--

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.080 align:middle line:10%
going back to that feeling
in those times of knowing

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.500 align:middle line:10%
is what we can hold as our own
example of what we can continue

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.065 align:middle line:10%
to do within ourselves.

00:54:00.065 --> 00:54:02.190 align:middle line:10%
Anything else that you'd
like to add or your guides

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:03.650 align:middle line:10%
would like to add
before we sign off?

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:04.860 align:middle line:10%
>> SELIG: Well, let's see if
they want to say anything.

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:05.760 align:middle line:10%
We would like to say two things.

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.500 align:middle line:10%
We would like to say two things.

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.790 align:middle line:10%
The divine as you has come.

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:11.002 align:middle line:10%
The divine as you has come.

00:54:11.002 --> 00:54:12.210 align:middle line:10%
And we will say this for you.

00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:13.710 align:middle line:10%
You may say it after
us if you wish.

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.510 align:middle line:10%
And we will say this for you,
and you may say it after us

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:17.310 align:middle line:10%
if you wish.

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:18.750 align:middle line:10%
It is an attunement to
the energy we work with.

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.008 align:middle line:10%
It is an attunement to
the energy we work with.

00:54:21.008 --> 00:54:22.050 align:middle line:10%
I know who I am in truth.

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:25.350 align:middle line:10%
I know who I am in truth.

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:27.210 align:middle line:10%
I know what I am in truth.

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:28.410 align:middle line:10%
I know how I serve.

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:30.650 align:middle line:10%
I know how I serve in truth.

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:31.450 align:middle line:10%
I am free.

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:32.020 align:middle line:10%
I am free.

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:32.310 align:middle line:10%
I am free.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.360 align:middle line:10%
I am free.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.380 align:middle line:10%
I am free.

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.280 align:middle line:10%
I am free.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.840 align:middle line:10%
The true self knows who she is--

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.960 align:middle line:10%
the true self knows who
she is-- knows what he is--

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.320 align:middle line:10%
knows what he is-- and can only
be free-- and can only be free,

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.310 align:middle line:10%
period.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.760 align:middle line:10%
They're saying period.

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.560 align:middle line:10%
Anything else?

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.727 align:middle line:10%
