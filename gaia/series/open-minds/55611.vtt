00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of the
fields I delve into regularly

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:10%
is revisionist history
of the human species,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:10%
from the work of Zecharia
Sitchin to Erich Von Daniken,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:10%
among several others.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:84%
This time, this unique
time in history now,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
is offering us a
completely different view

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
of how humans originated
on this planet.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:10%
Paul Von Ward is continuing this
line of inquiry in his new book

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.250 align:middle line:10%
"Children of a Living Universe."

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:10%
His life experience as a
Reverend, Naval officer,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.070 align:middle line:10%
service in the Foreign Office,
along with a graduate degree

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:10%
from Harvard and other
postgraduate degrees uniquely

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:10%
positions him to ask the big
questions, along with the rigor

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.770 align:middle line:10%
to do the research.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:90%
He's with us today.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And Paul, it's good
to see you again.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I think this is our
third time around--

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.385 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: I'm
delighted to be back.

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --so it
should be a charm.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.537 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: That's good.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
thing is, this isn't

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:90%
where you started out in life.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
highly esoteric subjects

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:84%
in our past conversations,
but that's not

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:90%
where you began your life.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Yet, here we are, so.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: No.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:10%
My life began in
Northwest Florida

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:10%
in a sharecroppers
farm, you know.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:10%
In a little community
of fundamentalists

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.920 align:middle line:10%
and a small rural school.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And I started there
doing the normal things,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
getting involved in the
church and being saved,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and then being tutored
as a youth minister

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and being urged to move ahead as
a pastor of a church and so on.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And I started in that
direction, never thinking

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:84%
about anything else
except theology.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:84%
But I have to, in retrospect,
confess that during that time

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I was already
questioning some things.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I went to my minister
and said, I'm

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
going to be a missionary in
Africa when I get my ordination

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:90%
and get going as a minister.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.400 align:middle line:90%
But I have a question for you.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
What God would let all
of those people in Africa

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.935 align:middle line:84%
die and go to hell for
eternity before I get there?

00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
That was a question I was asking
as a little kid in the Lutheran

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:90%
tradition of religion as well.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:90%
It made no sense.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: It made no sense.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, I had this sort
of little box of questions

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.760 align:middle line:84%
inside me that I
started to question.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And at Florida
State, where I was

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
in graduate school by that
time and had been ordained

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:84%
in a small rural church, and
I was challenging the theology

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:84%
of this fundamentalist
worldview.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And we had the great
fortune of having

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Paul Tillich, one of the
great Protestant Christian

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:84%
theologians of the
20th century, came

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to spend a few days with us in
the philosophy and the religion

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:90%
department.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- I had been
making-- every six months,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I would write a page
what I thought was God

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and how it fit into the
picture of our reality.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I was explaining
that I had this and I said,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
you have been talking about
God in such a different way,

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
how can you have such
a different definition?

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know, grey
hair, looking down on me,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, young man it's all
a question of your perception

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:90%
and your definition.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And that
was the moment that

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:84%
really released my
mind to question.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I had had the imprimatur of
this great theologian who

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.707 align:middle line:84%
could say that God and
the universe we're in,

00:04:15.707 --> 00:04:17.165 align:middle line:84%
is very different
from what I had--

00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:18.914 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's all a
matter of perception.

00:04:18.914 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: All the
matter of perception.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And then, you know--

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
your life went on.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
As they say-- What
was that saying?

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:84%
You can't keep them down on the
farm once they've seen Paris.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you were off
around the world.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
You were getting your graduate
and postgraduate degrees.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
You were leading a
large life that gave you

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.119 align:middle line:84%
a lot of contact with other
parts of civilization--

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Yeah.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Other cultures.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.508 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And other cultures.

00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that I think also

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
must have had a very
strong impact on you

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the rigidity of
what you were taught as a child

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:84%
compared to that statement,
it's all a matter of perception.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: I was so
fortunate when I

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:84%
left graduate
school-- and this was

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
in the early days of
the Vietnam period--

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and became a Naval
officer, and I was actually

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:90%
stationed in the United States.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, though, I was
picked up by the White House

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.720 align:middle line:84%
and given an appointment to
be a diplomat in the Foreign

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Service.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And my first post was
in Paris, but I had only

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:90%
been there six months.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I was sent
off to Malaysia

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:84%
as the member of the
advanced team of Lyndon

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Johnson as president
going to Malaysia.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:84%
The first one who's ever
visited Malaysia until Obama,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.950 align:middle line:84%
50 years later, went
back to Malaysia.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:84%
But anyhow, I took advantage
of that because I went

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
to the conference there that
we had, and then I visited--

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
came back through India, through
Iran on my way back to Paris,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.099 align:middle line:90%
and I was just reaping--

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you
absorbing a lot

00:06:01.515 --> 00:06:03.820 align:middle line:84%
of the religious
cultures along the way?

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: I wondered,
why am I doing this?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But I had to stop in India
and meet some of the Hindus,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and go to some of the places
that would give me concepts.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It was almost an impulse.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was not
intellectually developed.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I just had to go
to these places.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I had one
of my colleagues

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
in the Foreign Service
was in Tehran and said,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:90%
let's stop in Iran.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And I went there and the
first thing I asked to do,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I want to go to where
the Zoroastrians were.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:90%
And he said, really?

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.340 align:middle line:84%
He said, but it's just
some ruins and places

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:84%
where the oil comes out of
the ground itself and you had

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:90%
this continual flame.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I went and
experienced that in not

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.210 align:middle line:84%
an intellectual way, but some
kind of energetic feeling of,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
you know, I feel some
connection to this place.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't even really studied
Zoroastrianism very much,

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:90%
but I had that sense.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.612 align:middle line:84%
And anyhow, I can go on and
on with this tale, but it--

00:07:23.612 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this sounds
like a journey of the soul.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: It's
something like that.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And as I've traveled
around the world,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I literally have visited 100
countries in about 30 years,

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.200 align:middle line:84%
half of that in the Foreign
Service and half of it

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
with a nonprofit--
international nonprofit

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:90%
that I founded in Washington DC.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So in those 100
countries, you know,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I was just-- every
place I would go,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to
be studying politics

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and international relations and
all the projects and the jobs

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:84%
that I had were at
that political level.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But I was looking into the
culture and the culture

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:84%
of their religions, of their
worldviews, their philosophies.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And so after about
30 years of that,

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I had to let that go
and follow the research

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
that I had picked up all
of these clues about.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.860 align:middle line:84%
The different worldviews in
the world, the different belief

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:84%
systems, and my
own personal sort

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:41.460 align:middle line:84%
of correlating the behaviors of
cultures with their spiritual

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
and religious beliefs.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And so you-- as you were
picking up knowledge

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:52.189 align:middle line:84%
from these different
cultures and belief systems,

00:08:52.189 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
essentially what you're
trying to do in this book

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and what you are
doing, you start

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
out with the physics of the
universe itself up front.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the front
of the book, right?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:90%
It's like, let's get into it.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.290 align:middle line:90%
We're all the same stuff.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.569 align:middle line:84%
As above, so below, which
is a Hermetic Principle

00:09:05.569 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get
in that in a moment.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:07.566 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Exactly.

00:09:07.566 --> 00:09:08.066 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:08.066 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But taking it back
down to the ground just a bit,

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:84%
were you finding that there were
these large or missing gaps,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:84%
there were these gaps
in the stories when

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:84%
it comes to human
creation throughout all

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:84%
of the religions of the world
that you had been exposed to?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, the gaps were not
so much between what I now call

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
the Big Picture with these more
primitive, more traditional--

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Highly defined, yes.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: --worldviews.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But compared to
modern Christianity,

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.349 align:middle line:90%
that's where the gap was.

00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Because in
the Western world,

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:84%
in the Roman-- say picking
up Western civilization

00:09:52.400 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
with the Nicene Creed in 325 in
the current era, that period,

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:84%
that was a very narrow
view of reality.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:90%
It was how do I say, book end.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
By the time that Jesus
was allegedly here

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
to this point in time, it was a
very simplistic view of things.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:84%
You get here, you
have one shot at it.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.770 align:middle line:84%
You've got to make one
choice about the church

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and you were going
to heaven and hell.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:84%
We are the only
beings on the planet.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
We're the only beings
in the universe.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:90%
We are it.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And it is all controlled by this
anthropomorphic God figure, who

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.630 align:middle line:90%
is playing with us all the time.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.860 align:middle line:84%
That was the model that I grew
up in, but all of this travel

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and all of this contact
with other cultures--

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were getting
much deeper historical--

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Very different.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Thousands and thousands--

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:01.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: -of years.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even the
Greco-Roman, in those times

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.550 align:middle line:84%
they were influenced deeply
by the Egyptian times.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And even prior to
that, perhaps the-- we

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:84%
could even say perhaps Atlantean
or other cultures prior to.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: But see, at that time, I
didn't know any of that history

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
because no one
taught that history.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:84%
That's when I started going
back and looking into-- I

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:84%
had the Hindu very ancient
text, been interested in that

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
ever since I had
first gone to India.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:84%
But then I began to look
into the Egyptian area

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and that was coincident
with the Hindu traditions.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.340 align:middle line:90%
And it had another layer to it.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
You just intimated that with
the Atlantean, because--

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which most refer to
an ancient civilization that

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:84%
preceded it where the ancient
traditions and knowledge were

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.240 align:middle line:90%
passed down to them from.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: The Egyptians were
apparently one of the,

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:84%
if not the most lucky of the
survivors after the cataclysm

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:90%
about 11,500 years ago.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:23.640 align:middle line:84%
They had a lot of material
and artifacts and texts that

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
came from an earlier,
and we can use

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.037 align:middle line:84%
the word Atlantean,
that's Greek--

00:12:29.037 --> 00:12:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's the only
place you can really point to,

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's what a lot of
research is pointing to now.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.005 align:middle line:84%
That it's not a
mythical lost continent,

00:12:37.005 --> 00:12:38.490 align:middle line:90%
it's a lost continent.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: The only way to
interpret the ancient texts is

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
having some sort
of source for it

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:90%
which preceded these cultures.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, that's how I got
interested in these worldviews.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And picking up from the
Atlanteans, Egyptians,

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
the Greeks, the Romans with this
tradition of what we call today

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:84%
the Hermetic Principles, Thoth,
who was really-- the Egyptians

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:84%
alleged that he was
a ruler of Atlantis,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:29.300 align:middle line:84%
or Niter at that time,
not in Egypt itself.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:29.910 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:30.576 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: -that came down
through the Middle Ages,

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and we finally have some of
those documents still with us.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't the tradition,
the Hermetic tradition,

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:55.390 align:middle line:84%
based on the writings, the
teachings of Hermes, who also--

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: See, we don't
know about that.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Supposedly an
extension from Thoth to Hermes.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.529 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: To Thoth, and
Hermes is the Greek,

00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:90%
and then we bring that through.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:84%
But some people talk about
the Emerald Tablets and so on,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:84%
but what interested me was
those seven principles.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was
looking at the differences

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
in the different cultures about
the origin of Earth, humans,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
the universe, the Hermetic
Principles made a lot of sense.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go
back to Genesis,

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
for example, where it
says, in the beginning

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.020 align:middle line:84%
there was a voice that
said let there be light.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, now that's a very
interesting thing

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
physics because we

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
don't know exactly how the
universe is put together yet.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.284 align:middle line:84%
Our physicists are really
getting on a edge of a cliff.

00:14:59.284 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
I look at that

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and that seems to
me to be there's

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:90%
such an obvious gap there.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:10.040 align:middle line:84%
If you can't acknowledge the
existence of intelligence

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.730 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness or awareness,
whichever word you want

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:84%
to apply to it, in and of itself
as preexisting, so to speak,

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
how could you possibly account
for the rest of anything,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:90%
even just looking at a rose?

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Absolutely, that we have
ancient scientific principles

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
that we cannot account for
in our modern civilization.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that got
me motivated about this book

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
is a comparison of
that ancient wisdom

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
of the physics of the universe
with the standard model

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:84%
of science that we've been
using for the last 500 years.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you put those together
and you look at the experiments

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:84%
that we are doing in our
modern world of science

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and the CERN Laboratory
in Switzerland

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and another laboratory in
Italy where the researchers are

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:84%
looking at the standard model
using electromagnetic pulses

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
with light trying to find that
smallest little particle that's

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beyond the boson.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And every-- well,
the boson and now we're

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:90%
looking for the next one.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, beyond.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And as I said to
someone earlier today,

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
we have this technology,
these huge machines,

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and of course we're
going to get something

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to produce something.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
we get the boson

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:84%
or we get that next question
mark smaller particle,

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be an
artifact of our technology.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:84%
It says nothing about
what else is out there.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say in the
last six months,

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:84%
starting with Steven Hawking
about six months ago talking

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:28.285 align:middle line:84%
about black holes, and he
said about 40 years ago

00:17:28.285 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:84%
the black holes are going
to pull in this mass

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:84%
from all over the universe
and it will chew it up

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.610 align:middle line:90%
and it'll just disappear.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.251 align:middle line:90%
And it no--

00:17:36.251 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Frightened everyone.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Frightened everyone.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And then 40 years later, he has
said, well, now wait a minute.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:84%
If it's destructed
in the black hole,

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:90%
then it has to go somewhere.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, that's his
puzzle now at this point.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And then another week--
well, a month or two later,

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I heard an interview of
Roger Penrose talking

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:84%
about this same problem
and he was telling

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
the interviewer when he
got the question, well,

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:84%
if your standard
model is incomplete,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:84%
what would it take
to make it complete?

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.252 align:middle line:84%
And so Roger-- it
was very interesting

00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
because he's very
straightforward--

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:29.905 align:middle line:84%
and he said, well, you know,
it has to be a new model.

00:18:29.905 --> 00:18:30.947 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A new model.

00:18:30.947 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: A new model.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.536 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And this
is the first time

00:18:33.536 --> 00:18:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I've heard such a public
figure to say that.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Make such a
bold statement, yes.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And now since then,
and I think people like me

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and others who like to look
at the "Scientific American"

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
every month, the last
couple of three issues

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:58.820 align:middle line:90%
have articles on this problem.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:90%
One is in the CERN Laboratory.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:10.360 align:middle line:84%
What if you don't find the
next one after the boson?

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't complete
the model, and that's

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.394 align:middle line:84%
when you've got to
have a bigger picture.

00:19:16.394 --> 00:19:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: But then--

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.416 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's when
you need your new model.

00:19:19.416 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And then
just this month,

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:28.730 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful article having
the same ending to it,

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that these are physicists,
a couple of them

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and their team who've been
working together for I

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:84%
think it's now about 15 years,
using the technology that we

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:47.845 align:middle line:84%
have to find how we
go beyond a boundary.

00:19:47.845 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, the universe is
filled with boundaries.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.120 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's
a physical boundary.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:90%
There's the electromagnetic.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:90%
There's the light.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:84%
There's the-- every aspect, it
has its own feel about itself.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, they worked for
15 years on this project

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to find using the
electromagnetic field on light

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to see what they can do with
muons and other particles,

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:90%
and they are-- they failed.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And at this reminds me, it's
popping back into my mind.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I was doing an interview
in Germany in the mid '80s,

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
toward the late '80s, '87,
'88, somewhere in there,

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:84%
with a physicist
named Wolfgang Ludwig.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I mention him in
one other interview

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.560 align:middle line:84%
because another young physicist
also knows of his work.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, at the time,
he was talking about illness.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And he'd invented a device that
was a phase soft laser that

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:84%
put the information
of, it was light,

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:84%
color, sound,
crystalline energies

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and such into the acupuncture
meridians of the body.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And he excitedly
told me, he says,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:06.760 align:middle line:84%
what they don't understand is
yes, you have so many bosons,

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:84%
but it's the space
between the bosons that

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:90%
is what matters here.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember him
saying, they don't

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:84%
understand it's
the space between.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:84%
That's where the intelligence
exists that guides the boson.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:90%
He said bosons, but yes.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: But you've just brought
it to the point of this book,

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:84%
because what we're talking about
is that the universe should

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:84%
be looked at from
the other direction.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:38.227 align:middle line:84%
And that other direction is
information in the space.

00:21:38.227 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: What is that?

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:90%
That is the consciousness.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.622 align:middle line:84%
And so if you go back then
to the Hermetic Principles

00:21:45.622 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about before--

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And let's do that.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:84%
As above, so below, and
let's talk about that.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.955 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: As above, so below.

00:21:50.955 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So what we're saying is
that if you have the matter,

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and we know everything
in the physical realm

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:84%
is on a spectrum, and
then anything that's

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
in the energetic
spectrum, if you look

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:84%
at the electromagnetic scale
from very low to very high,

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:90%
so you have this spectrum.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the Hermetic
Principles as you said.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.640 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.977 align:middle line:84%
So you look then into
the area of information.

00:22:23.977 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And information
then is abstract,

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and then brought down to
concrete concepts and words

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.500 align:middle line:90%
that we use.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Why do we use these words?

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:90%
To make a voice.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And the voice of the universe,
it's the song of the spheres

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
kind of concepts--

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are parts of
principles of creation.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Yeah.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And the notion of just
an intent, and this

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:90%
goes back to Plato remember.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.950 align:middle line:84%
He said what is there
first is the idea.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And so if you begin to
look at the universe

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.710 align:middle line:84%
as an idea going
for information,

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:84%
then you go into the virtual
particle level, which you then

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:90%
have further condensation--

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: -more and more to
the heavy atoms that we have.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:90%
And this is then the universe.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.354 align:middle line:90%
And it is a ballooning--

00:23:32.354 --> 00:23:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: -it's like a balloon.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:10%
And what we've done
in our standard model

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:10%
is that it was one point
and it goes out like a cone.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:84%
If you look at all the aids
that are used in physics books

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.240 align:middle line:84%
today and on the internet
and television and so on,

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:90%
you have this cone.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we're understanding
at the lower level

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
the research in Italy

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and Switzerland, you have
the concept of inflations.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So inflation is then--
it starts at a point

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:90%
and then expands that way.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So our universe is
being misrepresented

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:90%
by this cone model.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It's really a balloon or some
sort of structure which is not

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:40.030 align:middle line:84%
a perfect ball,
but it is a balloon

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.010 align:middle line:90%
built around the structure.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:84%
The structure is the boundaries
of all these different spheres.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And it makes a lot more sense
in terms of thinking about life,

00:24:55.430 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:84%
the building of a solar
system, of a galaxy,

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:84%
all of these boundaries have
this intent, the information,

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and then it exposes
itself, expresses itself

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:90%
in the physical realm.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.251 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that requires
moving beyond the material

00:25:17.251 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:90%
sciences.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:19.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it doesn't
matter how sophisticated

00:25:19.735 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and how many billions
of dollars they're

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.660 align:middle line:84%
spending on accelerators
and so forth, you

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.360 align:middle line:84%
have to move beyond
the material sciences

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to find that
finite bit of information.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: But these
scientists that I referred

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to a little earlier, they
are actually getting,

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:90%
I think, to the precipice.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.023 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: -because they're--

00:25:41.023 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is so exciting.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And I wish I would
have 50 years more to go

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.235 align:middle line:84%
than maybe a couple
of decades more.

00:25:49.235 --> 00:25:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.489 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:50.489 --> 00:25:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And this is what you're saying.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to now
bring in ancient philosophy,

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:84%
ancient traditions,
lore, and understanding,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:90%
along with philosophy.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And even beyond that, cosmology,
into our understanding as

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:84%
we start constructing,
academically

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:84%
constructing not only the
universe, but this species

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.069 align:middle line:84%
and other species
in our solar system.

00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Yeah.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Without that,
you're saying, we can't do it.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you say, they bump
up against their limits.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Material sciences cannot
answer those questions.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: That's why we are very
lucky to have these ancients'

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:84%
concepts, because
that's going to give us

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.330 align:middle line:90%
the foundation for a new model.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm trying to
do is to just show that as you

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.910 align:middle line:84%
know, obviously,
scientists are not

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.380 align:middle line:84%
going to grab it and
embrace it totally.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But what I would like
to have people do

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.970 align:middle line:84%
is at least to look
at the possibility

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and to say let us
change our experiments

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:90%
in a different direction.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
the idea, and then

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:84%
go exploring on
the physical world

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:14.441 align:middle line:84%
rather than taking your
a priori machinery--

00:27:14.441 --> 00:27:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: -to smash
pieces of the world.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Still looking for
the answers in those pieces,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:84%
in the material aspects
of those pieces.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Right.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so along through
this journey and in the book,

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:90%
you go into all of this.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.817 align:middle line:84%
The background of
the quantum physics

00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and so forth and the
universe as being

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:84%
born from fields of information
vis-a-vis Hermetic Principles

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:38.520 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.070 align:middle line:84%
But you also introduce the
notion of advanced beings.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:84%
That advanced beings have
helped guide in the process.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And you speak of Thoth,
Yahweh, also Atlas

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:84%
as being perhaps some of
these advanced beings that

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:84%
had introduced this knowledge
for purpose throughout history.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.520 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, one
of the, I think,

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.050 align:middle line:84%
most significant set
of clues that there

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:84%
are other more advanced beings
than humans in this universe

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:84%
is that those ancient principles
and laws and knowledge that we

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:84%
get from the early Hindus,
the Egyptians, Atlanteans,

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, those
levels of knowledge

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that we are testing out
and validating today

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.880 align:middle line:84%
had to come from
very advanced minds.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's because they're
so precise and complete

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:46.430 align:middle line:90%
in their understanding.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Nothing like what
we have even today.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Yeah.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It's much more an integral
model of the universe,

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and we are just doing
little slices at it.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:05.495 align:middle line:84%
So that suggests
then that we are not

00:29:05.495 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:84%
the unique beings on
the universe plane.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's silly to think
about it in those terms.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.760 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
that sort of evidence

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that we can validate
that they were there

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.610 align:middle line:84%
because we have
the artifacts, we

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:84%
have the information
that's there

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:31.440 align:middle line:84%
that is now being validated in
science, so they must have come

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:37.150 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere else because we
don't have a history of them

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:84%
growing up on this
planet because they're

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.280 align:middle line:84%
own narratives suggest that
they came from someplace else.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And the humans who
were here physically

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:84%
saw them coming
from someplace else.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So we're probably
kindergarten level

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:04.260 align:middle line:84%
of beings on other
planets, and maybe even

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:12.540 align:middle line:84%
in sort of middle dimensions
between this pure level

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:18.710 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and the
physical bodies that we have

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and that a lot of the more
advanced beings had as well.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:31.590 align:middle line:84%
There are also, I think,
examples of beings that are not

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:34.532 align:middle line:90%
quite three-dimensional--

00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But are existing
in sub-dimensional fields,

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.625 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:30:37.625 --> 00:30:38.625 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Sub-dimensional.

00:30:38.625 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're sort of-- we
might say as above, so below.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:48.810 align:middle line:84%
They are like the virtual
particles in our physics model,

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.094 align:middle line:84%
because they are in a
different dimension--

00:30:51.094 --> 00:30:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dimensional state.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: -in terms of travelling,
in terms of their ability.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
is not to indicate

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.203 align:middle line:84%
they don't have
physicality, they just

00:30:57.203 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:84%
don't have physicality
within our ability to sense.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And for our
instrumentation as it

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.160 align:middle line:84%
is developed at
this point in time.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:05.826 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Exactly.

00:31:05.826 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Sure, yeah.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.029 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They have their
own physical realities.

00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: I'm glad you say that
because I think we need to keep

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:16.790 align:middle line:84%
in mind when we talk about our
science and our mechanisms that

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:23.610 align:middle line:84%
we use, they are mechanisms that
we have developed and they are

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.012 align:middle line:90%
limited by our own concepts--

00:31:26.012 --> 00:31:27.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Abilities to perceive.

00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: -that we have.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean whether it's through
technology or personally,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.420 align:middle line:84%
we can probably
perceive more personally

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.925 align:middle line:84%
if we open to it than
technology can, certainly.

00:31:36.925 --> 00:31:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Absolutely.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
taking that in mind,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.290 align:middle line:84%
so we have gone through
the fact that we're

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.630 align:middle line:90%
looking at the consciousness.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
the missing element

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.740 align:middle line:84%
that they're not going
to find through CERN

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.356 align:middle line:90%
or any other device out there.

00:31:50.356 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: It's not
going to happen.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.951 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now let's add
consciousness to the equation.

00:31:54.951 --> 00:31:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Now we add advanced beings
who've come to this planet

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and been here probably
before we have.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.409 align:middle line:84%
I mean, arguably,
they've always been here.

00:32:02.409 --> 00:32:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Yeah.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Evidence at least a quarter
of a billion years possibly.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say we need
to be looking at the creation

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:90%
story so to speak.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just calling
it a creation story.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.550 align:middle line:84%
The emergence of
the human species

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:21.430 align:middle line:84%
where we won't speak
of other species,

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:23.720 align:middle line:84%
just the human
species at this time,

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.480 align:middle line:84%
needs to be reflected
back in a new way.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:90%
We need a new story.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So what does that story
look like now for you?

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.990 align:middle line:84%
How would you tell
this story to us?

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, I think the story
is that we in this universe

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:84%
are a product of, or a child
of a multiverse, an omniverse,

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:55.620 align:middle line:84%
or a re-incarnating universe
because, as our friend

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Hawking now
has accepted that there

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.600 align:middle line:84%
had to be something
before something.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
is our universe

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:15.010 align:middle line:84%
came either in a rebirth or
was an inflation of an idea

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that more powerful
consciousness used

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
the mechanisms of consciousness
manifesting itself

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.580 align:middle line:90%
in physical form.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is where we--
we're part of that.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are you
saying that the universe,

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:38.170 align:middle line:84%
beyond normal anabolic,
catabolic function of birth

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and destruction,
itself reincarnates

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:45.630 align:middle line:84%
as well with its own guiding
intelligence, as you might say,

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:84%
a soul would reincarnate
through a physical body?

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Yeah.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we don't
have any proof of that.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But it makes sense that
if this to and fro,

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.580 align:middle line:84%
in and out of the quantum
field that we're now

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.920 align:middle line:84%
playing with in
physics is expanded

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.150 align:middle line:84%
to the level of
our universe, then

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:14.409 align:middle line:84%
it did come with design
structures, ideas

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:84%
that then are
manifesting themselves.

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And that we, as physical
beings and others

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:28.070 align:middle line:84%
in the universe
with us, are then

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:33.239 align:middle line:84%
intentions of this
conscious universe,

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:39.679 align:middle line:84%
which means that we are
children of this universe

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:44.819 align:middle line:84%
and we are expressing
the possibilities--

00:34:44.819 --> 00:34:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're an
aspect of consciousness.

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Absolutely.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.213 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:48.213 --> 00:34:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: But that we, as
humans, obviously we're

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:90%
not the whole ball game.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But maybe we are on
second base or something.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.120 align:middle line:84%
We're doing our
part of the game,

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and I use terms like
self-learning, self-evolving,

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
self-actualizing beings so that
we are a part of that beginning

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
impulse of completing
an action that

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:31.790 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the best we
can create in this multiverse

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:32.660 align:middle line:90%
that we are part of.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.201 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
also make the point

00:35:34.201 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of saying, yet, no lower and
no higher than anything else

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.690 align:middle line:84%
that is self-actualizing
within the universe.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing
that's happened

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:46.830 align:middle line:84%
is we-- whether it's
at the hand of religion

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:51.040 align:middle line:84%
where you're taught to kneel
and to be subservient to,

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.740 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's at the hand of
an ancient society of some kind

00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:01.160 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot, this whole notion
of humans being subservient to

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.560 align:middle line:90%
has been an issue for us.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:84%
It's been a deep
psychological wound

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that we somehow feel less than
because of the presence of what

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.960 align:middle line:84%
were, have been,
are advanced beings

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:84%
from advanced civilizations,
whether it's inter-dimensional

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.130 align:middle line:84%
or who've come here
in their vehicles.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, I think that
we humans, which I'm not sure

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.080 align:middle line:84%
that we could even say we humans
as an independent species.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.821 align:middle line:84%
We are likely to
be sort of half--

00:36:27.821 --> 00:36:29.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
engineered here and there.

00:36:29.696 --> 00:36:29.815 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:30.523 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:36:30.523 --> 00:36:33.456 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, or half
siblings of other--

00:36:33.456 --> 00:36:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutley.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: -people
on other planets.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:43.530 align:middle line:84%
But what we've got
here is we humans

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that are in control of
our institutions today

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:52.940 align:middle line:84%
have a worldview which is very
different from the one we're

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.480 align:middle line:84%
describing in this
little discussion.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is
the set of blinders

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:07.460 align:middle line:84%
on the positive constructive
evolution of humans

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.180 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, as
far as I'm concerned.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:09.763 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:09.763 --> 00:37:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Because we
are limiting ourselves

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:23.200 align:middle line:84%
by misinterpretating the
myths of ancient history.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Those myths are really
the narratives of history,

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and we've sort of taken those
words and the stories of beings

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.220 align:middle line:84%
from the sky and interaction
between humans and other beings

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and all of those tales,
those are narratives

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and we need to incorporate
them into our modern narrative.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And religions and
science both are

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:54.960 align:middle line:84%
loath to consider
that possibility.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening,
I think, when I first

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:84%
started thinking in these
terms 25 or 30 years ago,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I was really
despondent, you know,

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:06.980 align:middle line:84%
that you have to teach
the people who are here

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:14.290 align:middle line:84%
how to open their eyes
and expand their concepts

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:90%
and understandings.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.320 align:middle line:84%
But I think the way it
works now is most of it that

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:25.150 align:middle line:84%
is in change from the
traditional to this new living

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:28.740 align:middle line:84%
universe concept is
generation by generation.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And we're trying to
build a foundation of research

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and concepts and books
and films and so on

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:44.263 align:middle line:84%
that younger generations
are getting it.

00:38:44.263 --> 00:38:45.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are getting it.

00:38:45.513 --> 00:38:51.822 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: They're understanding
that things are possible.

00:38:51.822 --> 00:38:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I've interviewed
a couple of young physicists

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.572 align:middle line:90%
that are-- they totally get it.

00:38:55.572 --> 00:38:57.321 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't have
to explain a thing.

00:38:57.321 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:84%
They already figured it out
and they're on to the next.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, that
is happening and I've

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.100 align:middle line:84%
had the experience now
in the last few years

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:10.940 align:middle line:84%
to be at a conference and
talking and selling my books

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:84%
or something, and people
who come up-- 20 years ago,

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:21.005 align:middle line:84%
it was somebody who didn't have
much of an academic career.

00:39:21.005 --> 00:39:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And here are the professors
from universities saying,

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.720 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm in
anthropology but I have

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.559 align:middle line:84%
this interest in what
you're writing about.

00:39:30.559 --> 00:39:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's wonderful.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.310 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
encouraging conversation.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And it's just
beginning to happen.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:36.760 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:39:37.426 --> 00:39:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: -feel that we
are making some progress.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But going back to the point
you were making a moment ago,

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to open up to a new
cosmology, to open up

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:51.230 align:middle line:84%
to beyond religious
doctrine to the notion

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:55.480 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of something,
we're perhaps partially seeded,

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:59.060 align:middle line:84%
we can be genetically
partially spliced with,

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.700 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call it,
other beings from other places,

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.150 align:middle line:90%
that we're an evolving creation.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And just as we
create, they're have

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.810 align:middle line:90%
been a hand in all creations--

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.393 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Right.

00:40:08.393 --> 00:40:10.852 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -but without the
mass inferiority complex.

00:40:10.852 --> 00:40:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is something
you wrote about in the book

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.180 align:middle line:90%
that I found interesting.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to get
into a couple specifics.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Just like the notion of bowing
before or kneeling before,

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and you do address this saying
that these traditions may have

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:27.610 align:middle line:84%
been passed on by way
of our interactions,

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:32.370 align:middle line:84%
historically, with beings
of a more advanced nature.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, I think
that we-- you know,

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:37.080 align:middle line:84%
it's like when I was
a freshman in college

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and the professors
were there and I

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:90%
had to genuflect the professor.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And we had that, I think,
early in human history

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:51.080 align:middle line:84%
where you had more advanced
beings and they had the power.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's also like
the European countries

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that colonized the more
primitive societies

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:84%
within the last
few hundred years.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So the same sort
of thing happened

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:06.600 align:middle line:84%
with more advanced
beings with humans.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
they did is they

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.740 align:middle line:84%
became subjugated
psychologically.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.380 align:middle line:90%
They became worshipful.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.020 align:middle line:84%
They were dependent on
these more advanced beings.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And it just started what I would
call a personality syndrome

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:30.210 align:middle line:84%
of deference and looking
elsewhere for the answers

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:33.017 align:middle line:84%
rather than from
your own experiences.

00:41:33.017 --> 00:41:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And arrogance on
the part of the colonialists.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, very much
arrogance there, too.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
some of that happened

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:46.620 align:middle line:84%
by more intelligent
humans, who actually

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:50.460 align:middle line:84%
used that psychological
dependence

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:56.220 align:middle line:84%
syndrome to manipulate
the cult members

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.640 align:middle line:90%
during the cults of the gods.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And then when religions
were more institutionalized,

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.900 align:middle line:84%
you used that same dependence,
that psychological--

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Control.

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: -control, manipulation.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And when it didn't work
psychologically and

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:19.170 align:middle line:84%
intellectually, the
religions used force.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.510 align:middle line:84%
The Christians
slaughtered all kinds

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:25.460 align:middle line:84%
of people, the Inquisitions,
torture, burning people

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.570 align:middle line:90%
at the stake.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.540 align:middle line:84%
We've grown out of most
of that, but the mentality

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.960 align:middle line:90%
is still there.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you look into
other religions still now

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.990 align:middle line:84%
are doing exactly the same
thing to control their masses,

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want to
talk about the living

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.320 align:middle line:84%
universe, the bigger universe
that we are parts of that.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And we are all, as individuals,
are our own little boundary.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Now we're interlaced with
one another in physical terms

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and in consciousness terms,
as in energetic terms.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.255 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot of research
about how we're connected--

00:43:06.255 --> 00:43:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we do.

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: -with our-- that's
just so obvious now,

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:16.590 align:middle line:84%
that we are connected in
these different dimensions.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But you have to look at
yourself, then though,

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:28.340 align:middle line:84%
as direct to whatever
that original intent is.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.315 align:middle line:90%
That is each of us--

00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a direct
reflection of it.

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: And a reflection of it.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But we can be in our
lower level here,

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.540 align:middle line:90%
if you want to use that term.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:48.980 align:middle line:84%
On planet Earth, we do get
interactions in our own species

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and in our own cultures, and
we have some stronger people

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.410 align:middle line:90%
who manipulate.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
to do is to also take

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.770 align:middle line:84%
the bigger picture
of the cosmology,

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:84%
but we've also got to
change our model of culture.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:10.249 align:middle line:90%
That it's not hierarchical.

00:44:10.249 --> 00:44:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's really why
you wrote the book, isn't it?

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:13.665 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: That's right.

00:44:13.665 --> 00:44:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The point
is that we are

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:19.320 align:middle line:84%
direct-- we're in a
direct lineage of all

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.370 align:middle line:90%
of this creative force.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:21.120 align:middle line:90%
We're part of it.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.860 align:middle line:84%
We are creating ourselves
on a daily basis.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't understand
the nature of what you are,

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.260 align:middle line:84%
it's very rare
that a person will

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.320 align:middle line:84%
try to buck against it
if you don't understand

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.670 align:middle line:90%
the nature of what you are.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: No, that's
exactly right.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're going to live
within all those little boxes

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and boundaries.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, we've had
a lot of inculcation

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:42.620 align:middle line:84%
of these traditional
concepts of dependence

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:45.620 align:middle line:90%
on some anthropomorphic figure.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is another
area that I think

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.320 align:middle line:84%
is very interesting in this
new model of consciousness.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we're having now some
progress in neuroscience.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
consciousness comes from

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know how our
mind actually comes together.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But we are beginning to
learn that our consciousness,

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:19.860 align:middle line:84%
whatever that source is,
works through our brain

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:26.345 align:middle line:84%
physical networks, the amygdala
and the prefrontal cortex.

00:45:26.345 --> 00:45:28.505 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The mind operates
outside of the brain

00:45:28.505 --> 00:45:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and uses it as a
processing unit.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: But it
does go through it,

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, you can connect
these ideas with your emotions.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happens
at the amygdala level

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:49.180 align:middle line:84%
so that when we go through
this process of conditioning,

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:55.580 align:middle line:84%
of teaching by elders,
by wise people, in quote,

00:45:55.580 --> 00:46:05.320 align:middle line:84%
people are then not in
control of their own singular

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.710 align:middle line:84%
consciousness because
you've got to go

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:14.270 align:middle line:84%
through this emotional,
physical set of networks.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that-- you can't
just have a wand and say

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.092 align:middle line:90%
we will clear those thoughts.

00:46:22.092 --> 00:46:23.300 align:middle line:90%
You don't need them any more.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.508 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, this is very,
very ancient programming.

00:46:25.508 --> 00:46:26.979 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: It is very--

00:46:26.979 --> 00:46:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
quite a complex--

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.103 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: -deep.

00:46:29.103 --> 00:46:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -matrix
of subtle bodies

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:32.300 align:middle line:84%
with the emotional
and the mental

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.010 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, and physical.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And having to break through
all of that one time,

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:38.434 align:middle line:84%
you have to create
new neural networks.

00:46:38.434 --> 00:46:40.100 align:middle line:84%
It all has to be
repatterned, but it all

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.840 align:middle line:84%
starts with one
little seed and that's

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.430 align:middle line:84%
why I like what
you've done here.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Because this subject gives
you a new understanding

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.800 align:middle line:84%
of what you are, what
you've come from,

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:53.660 align:middle line:84%
what your capability is as a
creator within the universe.

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: I think the book and
research, not only myself

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.920 align:middle line:84%
but others who are
working in this area,

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:11.110 align:middle line:84%
it is a strong set of
stimuli to decondition

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:16.310 align:middle line:84%
this limited worldview
that we are trapped

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:19.867 align:middle line:90%
in both by science and religion.

00:47:19.867 --> 00:47:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And so, we need to
think about it in those terms.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.800 align:middle line:90%
This is an anecdote.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mind the
gap, as they say.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Mind the gap.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.655 align:middle line:84%
It's in the gap, just like
information is in the spaces--

00:47:32.655 --> 00:47:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: That's right.

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -between the bosons.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: That's right.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:34.920 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.211 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, do you think
that we're coming to a point

00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:41.485 align:middle line:84%
where the term junk DNA is
going to be basically scrapped?

00:47:41.485 --> 00:47:44.030 align:middle line:90%


00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, I don't know,
because I have a thought

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:54.210 align:middle line:84%
that it is used
by consciousness.

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.312 align:middle line:90%
And I think the--

00:47:56.312 --> 00:47:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain that.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.515 align:middle line:84%
The term junk DNA is
used by consciousness?

00:47:59.515 --> 00:48:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Junk-- we called
it junk the first time

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:08.680 align:middle line:90%
because we had no purpose.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And we now know that
some of that quote,

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:19.600 align:middle line:84%
"junk," actually has functions
in the expression of the DNA.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And so my little model
is that consciousness

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:29.910 align:middle line:84%
works through the whole
integral physical body.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And that our
consciousness that is

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:41.480 align:middle line:84%
beyond this, it seems
to me can, with whatever

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.980 align:middle line:84%
the energetic signals are
that stimulate the expression

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:51.270 align:middle line:84%
of our DNA, I think it
can work in that whole--

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:52.087 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:52.087 --> 00:48:53.920 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm getting
to is it seems to me

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.490 align:middle line:84%
that that aspect of
the non-physical aspect

00:48:56.490 --> 00:49:00.760 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves has to be working
through the physical vehicle

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.630 align:middle line:84%
through more subtle
mechanisms with the DNA that

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:05.890 align:middle line:90%
is called junk DNA.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:08.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have maybe its
obvious physical purpose

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.020 align:middle line:84%
that they've been
able to identify,

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.650 align:middle line:90%
but it is expressing itself.

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Yeah.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's right.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:18.012 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I look at it
as the medium through which--

00:49:18.012 --> 00:49:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.020 align:middle line:84%
I think we're saying
the same thing.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.478 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Yeah, I
think that's right.

00:49:21.478 --> 00:49:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I see it as sort of-- I
talked about the boundary,

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.160 align:middle line:84%
the boundary of consciousness
that is after death,

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:36.960 align:middle line:84%
near death, between
incarnations, whatever position

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:43.270 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness that
is there, the boundary.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I use the word
boundary, it's not impermeable.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:53.300 align:middle line:84%
It's permeable, but at
least-- this is my hand.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.830 align:middle line:84%
It has a boundary, but it can
get interlaced with another.

00:49:57.830 --> 00:49:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is the kind of way

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.930 align:middle line:84%
we've got to think about
consciousness interlacing--

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With DNA.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And our DNA and the
intelligence lacing

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:07.919 align:middle line:84%
with the DNA of everything
external as well.

00:50:07.919 --> 00:50:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Absolutely.

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:09.010 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why I was thinking,

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, surely, hopefully
in the next 20 years

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.780 align:middle line:84%
or so, they won't be making
that silly little statement

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:18.042 align:middle line:84%
about 95% of it being
junk DNA any longer.

00:50:18.042 --> 00:50:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Oh, absolutely.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's talk about
a little bit of the phenomena--

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.940 align:middle line:84%
we still have about
10 minutes left--

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and the work of Javier Cabrera,
because you mentioned him

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:26.610 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit in your book.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some of
the physical phenomena.

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:31.375 align:middle line:84%
I love the subject
of phenomena--

00:50:31.375 --> 00:50:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Well, I

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -that is indicating
something else is going on

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.626 align:middle line:90%
around here.

00:50:34.626 --> 00:50:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Well, that's right.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, I talked a
lot about Cabrera

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:44.180 align:middle line:84%
because I spent some time down
in Peru some years ago now.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And I went to his
museum where he

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:58.650 align:middle line:84%
had all of these objects that
had strange features and so on,

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:03.780 align:middle line:84%
but they were
thousands of years old.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's been pretty
well validated at this point.

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:13.870 align:middle line:84%
When I first visited him,
there was all this controversy

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that he's doing this himself
and creating these and trying

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:19.400 align:middle line:90%
to make up--

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Some of this stuff you
can't machine today.

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:25.050 align:middle line:84%
You can't get these iridescent
light-filled qualities

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:26.830 align:middle line:90%
of these objects even.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:28.250 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how to do it yet.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But this guy did
all this on his own?

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: So anyhow, no, I think
that in terms of phenomena that

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:40.530 align:middle line:84%
we-- and this gets us
into a whole other realm,

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:45.017 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the what I call
ABs, or aliens, or ETs, or--

00:51:45.017 --> 00:51:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Advanced Beings.

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: -phenomenon,
whatever, you

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:58.660 align:middle line:84%
know this is where we see
these virtual particles that we

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.060 align:middle line:90%
were talking about earlier.

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:05.060 align:middle line:84%
The physicist saying, I found
a virtual particle of this muon

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.690 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:12.100 align:middle line:84%
The virtual particle
of a full being

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:21.390 align:middle line:84%
could be in a variety of stages
of physical condensation.

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that-- and this is
really getting sort of weird,

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it may be that this
phenomena can merge literally

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.260 align:middle line:90%
with our own physical selves.

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to
a number of people

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:42.740 align:middle line:90%
who have sensed that experience.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their experience is that
they were taken over or filled

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.447 align:middle line:84%
with another entity
of some sort.

00:52:54.447 --> 00:52:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:53:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: So I think that's an
example of you getting out

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.250 align:middle line:84%
of the physical, you
get out of the energy,

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:12.470 align:middle line:84%
you get into the quantum
area and the material realm.

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Then you get into
this energy form,

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and you get in this condensation
of conscious, I don't know.

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:25.590 align:middle line:84%
You'd call them
sort of expressions.

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:31.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like some of
the elders have

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.590 align:middle line:90%
done in our aboriginal cultures.

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:38.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, where I
will give you a hex

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and that phenomenon will go to
you and do whatever he or it--

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a very
real phenomena, yes.

00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: And so, this is another
aspect of this universe here.

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
encompass all of that,

00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:01.650 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me,
in this new model.

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I have another
question to ask you,

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and that has to do with you also
in your past-life experiments--

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:10.570 align:middle line:84%
last time we got
together, we were talking

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:12.480 align:middle line:84%
about past-life
experiments and you

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.440 align:middle line:84%
have a pretty strong-- you've
studied your own incarnation

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.186 align:middle line:84%
path and have a pretty
strong inclination

00:54:18.186 --> 00:54:19.810 align:middle line:84%
that you were among
some gentleman that

00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:23.470 align:middle line:84%
were in this country
at its earliest ages

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:26.070 align:middle line:84%
of formation in
this young country.

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:27.620 align:middle line:84%
A group of gentleman
that were also

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:32.110 align:middle line:84%
steeped in a lot of the
ancient esoteric wisdoms,

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:36.080 align:middle line:84%
including Hermeticism, and
so have you come to a feeling

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps in this
incarnation, like you said,

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.422 align:middle line:84%
you were studying
one thing but you

00:54:41.422 --> 00:54:42.880 align:middle line:84%
asked questions
and had an inkling.

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Something else was
scratching there,

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:48.776 align:middle line:84%
itching at the
back of the brain.

00:54:48.776 --> 00:54:50.150 align:middle line:84%
By way of curiosity,
do you think

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that you may have
brought through knowledge

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:55.580 align:middle line:84%
from another era, questions
from that other era

00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:58.300 align:middle line:84%
where these gentlemen had
high esoteric knowledge?

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.652 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: I usually talk about
things in the abstract.

00:55:01.652 --> 00:55:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: This is a little bit--

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm putting you on
the spot just a little bit.

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: Well, no,
and I do want to say

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:13.170 align:middle line:84%
that I do believe that
the research that I've

00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:17.060 align:middle line:84%
done on a lot of
cases and on my own,

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm very much convinced that
we have this soul genome

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:28.050 align:middle line:84%
or whatever word you want to
use, psychoplasm, that does

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:32.410 align:middle line:84%
go from generation to generation
and maybe shares itself

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:36.280 align:middle line:84%
in different incarnations
at the same time.

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.210 align:middle line:84%
That's something
else that I'm looking

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:39.336 align:middle line:90%
into at this point in time.

00:55:39.336 --> 00:55:40.543 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Paralell realities.

00:55:40.543 --> 00:55:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: But, yeah, I
think when we started off,

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:49.341 align:middle line:84%
I talked about a young boy
asking these questions.

00:55:49.341 --> 00:55:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just
saying was there a soul

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:52.990 align:middle line:84%
imprint from that
older gentleman

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:56.350 align:middle line:84%
long ago that was curious
about similar such things that

00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:58.360 align:middle line:84%
might be driving a
lot of this in you?

00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.270 align:middle line:90%
In all of us?

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: I think so, because
where would these ideas come

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:10.400 align:middle line:84%
from in my age, 15
years old or 18 years?

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that I have
been incarnated

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:18.610 align:middle line:84%
in a soul that has
a trajectory that

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:22.600 align:middle line:84%
has been very
active in religions,

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:28.300 align:middle line:84%
in philosophy, and in
science and cosmology.

00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:32.435 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that I've done
all of that all the time.

00:56:32.435 --> 00:56:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: But I think there is a
core sense of one's own essence

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and its expression that ought
to flourish in a lifetime.

00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
kind of work coming

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:59.302 align:middle line:84%
in the second half of
my life, flourishing

00:56:59.302 --> 00:57:03.102 align:middle line:84%
and adding to, I
think, experiences.

00:57:03.102 --> 00:57:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I
asked that because I

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:06.020 align:middle line:90%
think it's true of all of us.

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't see anything as born
of just this moment only,

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:12.570 align:middle line:84%
It's all imprinted with
some kind of desire.

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:16.492 align:middle line:84%
The people that are joining us
right now and watching this,

00:57:16.492 --> 00:57:18.450 align:middle line:84%
they have their own
imprint that has taken them

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:20.040 align:middle line:84%
down this path of
inquiry as well.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And these are
cycles, but it's just

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.930 align:middle line:84%
coming to a point
of maturation now

00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:27.320 align:middle line:84%
where the masses
have access to it.

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Not like when you
were back then and it

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:31.840 align:middle line:84%
was all hidden knowledge
and secreted away

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.440 align:middle line:84%
from the masses who were busy
farming and doing other things

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and had their own interests.

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Now we all have access
to this potential

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:41.670 align:middle line:84%
for expanding our understanding
of the universe and ourselves.

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:45.230 align:middle line:10%
>>WARD: And I think
that in this lifetime

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:48.710 align:middle line:10%
the notion of this
model is that we

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:54.710 align:middle line:10%
are to evolve in a more
self-actualizing way, adding

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:58.101 align:middle line:10%
to those past lifetimes
and those experiences.

00:57:58.101 --> 00:57:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So going from a Reverend
preaching a rather narrow

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:06.390 align:middle line:84%
message once upon a
time to now, that's big.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But it sounds to me
like human sovereignty

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and the encouragement of human
sovereignty is your main goal.

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WARD: It is
possible to rise out

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:21.470 align:middle line:84%
of the moment and the
physical place and situation

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:27.360 align:middle line:84%
that you are born into,
and you have this potential

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:31.750 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
express in a lifetime,

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's the goal it
seems to me, for all of us.

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Couldn't agree more.

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And once again, thank you so
much, Paul, for joining us

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:42.720 align:middle line:90%
and for writing this book.

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.790 align:middle line:84%
You've done a beautiful
job on your research there.

00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:45.998 align:middle line:90%
>>WARD: Thank you, very much.

00:58:45.998 --> 00:58:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.420 align:middle line:10%
Again, the book, "Children
of a Living Universe,"

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:51.440 align:middle line:10%
which you can buy through
online booksellers.

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.430 align:middle line:10%
To go deeper into some
of Paul's other work,

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:56.910 align:middle line:10%
you can dive into our Gaiam TV
archives under "Open Minds,"

00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:59.800 align:middle line:10%
and also our "Conscious Media
Network" archives as, again, we

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.700 align:middle line:10%
said this is our
third interview.

00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
