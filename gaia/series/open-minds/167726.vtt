00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Doctor Raymond Moody

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:10%
is perhaps the most influential
voice in the subject of life

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:10%
after life.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:84%
The 1992 film by this name
has been a phenomenal tool

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:84%
for people facing end-of-life
issues on a spiritual level.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:10%
Today, Dr. Moody is with us to
share a beautiful story of life

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:10%
after life and much,
much, much more.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.640 align:middle line:90%
We've been talking off camera.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:84%
We could do three, four,
five hours together.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I
wanted to do this.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Last time we met, we did
your whole life story--

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
your whole background--
not just academically,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:84%
but how it started morphing
into this area of work.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I can say
right now, anyone

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:84%
that wants to know
about the backstory,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:84%
they can go to the
other interview.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
This one, I just
loved the work that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:84%
was done in that film
and the representations

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:90%
by the people that had died.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So much-- I thought
we just need to do--

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.489 align:middle line:84%
we need to feature
them again, OK?

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I know it's kind of
classic, and then

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
getting into the new
understandings, the nuances

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:84%
of these stories,
and what's happened

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
to some of these people since
that film was shot, right?

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, I just watched
it again for fun the other day.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think the one thing
that keeps standing out more

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
than anything is this
incredible state of love

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
once we can getting loosened
up from physical reality.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Can you just talk about
that for a moment?

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RAYMOND MOODY: Well, yes.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:10%
As a psychiatrist, one of
the most interesting things

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:10%
about people, to me,
is that most people

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.950 align:middle line:10%
seem to be chasing something.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:10%
Like people chase power, or
money, or fame, or a few of us

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:10%
chase knowledge.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But after a
near-death experience,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:84%
whatever they were
chasing before,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:84%
people come back
from that experience

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.810 align:middle line:84%
saying that what life is all
about is learning to love.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
As Eben Alexander and I
were talking just recently,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's like-- the idea we
came up with together is that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:84%
the afterlife seems to
consists primarily of love

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:90%
and information--

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and that people,
when they come back

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:84%
from a near-death
experience, say that love

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:90%
is what life is all about.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, that
doesn't make it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.382 align:middle line:84%
necessarily much easier for
them to get that done in life.

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean
this is the thing.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of them, once
they go through this experience,

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.705 align:middle line:84%
most of them do not want
to come back into the body.

00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: They don't.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And also they say that
when you get back here,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:84%
you still have all the
human feelings and so on.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
You fly off the handle and say
things you wish you hadn't have

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:90%
said and so on.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, from
getting to know literally

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:84%
thousands of people since 1965
who have had this experience, I

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:84%
can honestly say,
as a group, they

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:84%
do seem to be on the right
track more than the rest of us,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:90%
by and large.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the incredible
bliss they're experiencing--

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
when you've kept track of
these people afterward,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:84%
how long does this
kind of afterglow

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:90%
normally last for people?

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: It doesn't change.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to people who had
their near-death experience

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
40 or 50 years before, and they
still remember it very vividly.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's the kind
of thing that--

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:84%
it affects people in
a very positive way

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know,
when you think about this,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.206 align:middle line:84%
you wonder what this
Earth is all about.

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I really wonder
what it's all about.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.538 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you think that
everyone of these people goes

00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:84%
through this experience of
incredible grace and love

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:84%
as soon as they're out of
the physical body, have you--

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure you've spent
time thinking about it--

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:84%
what is this that
we're doing here

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that really results in such
incredible pressure and pain

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
compared to what happens as
soon as we get out of this?

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, that's very
interesting that you ask me

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
that question and that you
might even listen to my answer--

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and that I've got to say with
all sense of humor on this one.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody knows is the
answer to your question.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:84%
But I guess my take on it, as
an undergraduate philosophy

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:84%
student and then later
PhD in philosophy

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and a professor
of philosophy well

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
before I went to
medical school, that's

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:84%
just part of philosophy-- to
think about these big issues.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: And one of the
big philosophical problems

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that gets involved with
the afterlife question

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:84%
is the question of what
it is that constitutes

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.780 align:middle line:90%
our personal identity.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Plato was the person, more than
anybody else who, in the West,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:84%
came up with this notion
of soul but was taken up

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:90%
into Christianity.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And Plato's idea was that our
personal identity consists not

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:90%
of our body but of our soul.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:10%
But then as time
went on, then it

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:10%
got up to that time of
Thomas Hobbes and so on.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:10%
And people were beginning
to realize that that was

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:10%
a kind of not-too-plain notion.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Then John Locke, for example,
said that our personal identity

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:90%
consists of our memories.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:90%
But in reality, nobody knows.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.330 align:middle line:90%
But this is my conjecture.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:84%
The closest answer,
to me, I think was--

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:84%
when I was a kid, I
read this book by--

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:90%
several books by Elie Wiesel.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And in one of his
books, he said,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
God made man because
he loved stories.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.746 align:middle line:90%
And I think about it.

00:06:17.746 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you
think about what

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:90%
is your life except your story?

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of think
that wonderful question

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.680 align:middle line:90%
you just asked, what is this?

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, at 73, I'm not worried
about people calling me

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:90%
psychotic or anything anymore.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So, I never was much anyway, but
I think that this is narrative.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have a sort
of narrative idea

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:90%
of personal identity.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.005 align:middle line:84%
Whatever new thing happens
to you, what happens

00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:57.165 align:middle line:84%
is that you incorporate
it into your life story.

00:06:57.165 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And this really is a very
hard, conceptual thing.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like,
we are our story.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And then as I'm beginning
to feel or sense

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
because of my career,
I gather that we die,

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and then we go through some
incomprehensible process.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And then apparently, to my
utter astonishment-- then,

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:90%
we're back on another one.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And I say that knowing some of
the people who are allegedly

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
experts in reincarnation,
so that's not

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:90%
where I get my take on this.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't trust
parapsychological reasoning

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.940 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I am not a parapsychologist,
nor am I one

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:90%
of the anti-parapsychologists--

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:90%
the pseudoskeptics.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.809 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not the head
of the skeptics society, yeah.

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: That's the same
group, in my opinion-- the two.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.645 align:middle line:90%
They really share the same

00:08:02.645 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Two sides
of the same coin.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.365 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Assumptions.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sort of out of
that orbit entirely.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And where I have come to sort
of accept, on some level,

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:84%
that there is
reincarnation-- that actually

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:90%
comes from my kids.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.740 align:middle line:90%
See, I was not born religious.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I was free from the
blight of religion

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.435 align:middle line:84%
because of my circumstance
and my family.

00:08:25.435 --> 00:08:26.235 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:08:26.235 --> 00:08:28.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
that circumstance?

00:08:28.085 --> 00:08:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, this
is partly after--

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.350 align:middle line:84%
you know, because the World
War II generation didn't talk.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was a medic in World
War II in the Pacific theater,

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Now flash forward
to my childhood,

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and my dad was very
sarcastic about religion.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And now I put it together
to see that he never

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.920 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
horrible things he saw.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that he sort of
got sarcastic about religion

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:90%
because of that experience.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:90%
So I grew up free of it.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And I can honest to
goodness tell you

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:84%
that the first inkling
that I had that anybody

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:84%
took the afterlife
question seriously

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
was in my first year in College
reading Plato's Republic.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And Plato immediately
became my hero.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And I realized-- this was a
blatant appeal to authority,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:84%
but I remember
reading about that

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and reading in the Republic
that Plato's is very

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:90%
serious about the afterlife.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.525 align:middle line:84%
So that is what woke me up to it
and the idea of the importance

00:09:34.525 --> 00:09:35.325 align:middle line:90%
of the question.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.599 align:middle line:84%
And it's still very
counterintuitive to me.

00:09:42.599 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why is it
counterintuitive?

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, for one
thing, because it's

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:90%
a self-contradiction.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was a professor
of logic and philosophy

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.610 align:middle line:84%
of language and Greek
philosophy before I

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:90%
went to medical school.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And people say those
phrases all the time-- there

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.160 align:middle line:90%
is life after death.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And it brings ideas into your
mind or images or whatever.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a comfy
feeling, like that there

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:90%
must be something to it.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, there
is no cognitive concept

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.640 align:middle line:84%
behind sentences like,
there is life after death.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, this is
very counterintuitive.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Now it's something
that I have come

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to have to accept through a
long series of experiences--

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:90%
not that I brought on myself.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote "Life after
Life," my career path

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.910 align:middle line:84%
was that I was going to
be a professor of logic,

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.072 align:middle line:84%
and philosophy of language,
and philosophy of medicine.

00:10:48.072 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that flew
you right out there--

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:90%
other door then.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.731 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, and this
is not what I would

00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:90%
have chosen as my life path.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
But back to the
reincarnation thing--

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I have two wonderful adopted
kids-- both adopted at birth.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Carter is 19, and he is
Mexican-American by heritage,

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and Carolyn is a Native American
Blackfeet Indian from Montana.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I
don't take those kids

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
to any sort of
religious ceremonies.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Number two, we don't talk about
life after death in my house.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the phone bill,
what's for dinner, the movies

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:90%
this weekend, the homework.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
my main interest.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:84%
My main interest is logic,
and philosophy of language,

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:90%
and Greek philosophy.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So with all that, Carter,
when he was five years old,

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
we were watching TV and I was
flipping through the channels

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and flipped through what
turned out to be the National

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Geographic Channel.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:90%
And Carter became very animated.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, dad, dad,
that's my village.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:90%
So he turned back.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was a documentary
about village life in China.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So he just started
going on and on.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, dad, before I
came to you and mom,

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I was with my
brothers and sisters

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:90%
and my mom and dad in China.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, my Blackfeet
daughter, this

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.845 align:middle line:84%
is about seven or eight years
ago-- we were walking along

00:12:17.845 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, out of
nowhere, she said,

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't like this place.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was obvious she was
talking about the world.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So one thing you learn to
do in psychiatry, which

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
is just so annoying for
the rest of your life,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.880 align:middle line:90%
is you don't react.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:90%
So there I was.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:90%
I just wasn't reacting.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.420 align:middle line:84%
But she could, obviously,
tell that sort of startled me.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah, yeah.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
She said, you know when
you die, you just go up

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and you be with God, she said,
until all the people you know

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:90%
have died.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, he sends you
back as another person.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
makes you think that?

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And just like this, she
said, I just know in my mind.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah,
and I was with God,

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:90%
and God pointed you out to me.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you've got to
go down to be his daughter.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, how
did you feel about that?

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh I
didn't want to do it.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And she said, but
God pushed me--

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.030 align:middle line:84%
just like this, she said--
down to be your daughter.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, are
you glad you came anyway?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.210 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:90%
And I don't ask them.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you ask them
anything about it, then you'd--

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.470 align:middle line:90%
and I don't ask them.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But maybe because of that, they,
once in a while, go back to it.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.340 align:middle line:90%
And they add details.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's very interesting.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:90%
And so I sort of give up.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Where I have come to
in all this is that I

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:90%
am a skeptic in the real sense.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
These idiots who say
that they're skeptics

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
don't even know
what the word means.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are kind
of Houdini wannabes

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:84%
or just want to
emulate their hero.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And also a lot of
them have that kind

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:84%
of parapsychological mindset,
where they're interested in it,

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:90%
see.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And they share the
same assumptions

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.750 align:middle line:90%
with the parapsychologists.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
But I am skeptic, not in
that sense that doesn't--

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:84%
is just of ignoramuses who don't
even know what the word means.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I am what you call a
Pyrrhonian skeptic, which is--

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Pyrrho, about 20 years after
the death of Aristotle,

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.330 align:middle line:90%
formed the skeptical movement.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And what skepticism is all about
is the process of conducting

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
your inquiry so that
you ask every question

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and you really bear down.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, you purposely
withhold the conclusion.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.905 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what it means.

00:14:58.905 --> 00:15:02.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, but why would
they withhold the answer?

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, it's
really interesting,

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:84%
because you know, in the
ancient philosophy-- today,

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
we distinguish between
the intellectual quest

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual quest.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of approach would
be incomprehensible to, say,

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.110 align:middle line:84%
the early great
philosophers like Plato,

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:90%
and so they didn't distinguish.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And so what the
skeptics realized

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
is that if you learn
logic very well,

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and you follow every rule,
and you really bear down

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:84%
on every question,
but then, in the end,

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
you withhold the
conclusion, then what

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:90%
that does is two things.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it does a really
interesting thing to your mind.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a mind
expansion experience.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
That's very personal the
way it does you inside.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very desirable
kind of experience to have.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
But procedurally, if you
think of it in this way

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:84%
that everybody else is
rushing in this direction

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.330 align:middle line:84%
to get to the conclusion,
but your technique is

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.720 align:middle line:84%
to withhold a conclusion,
then what that does

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:90%
is that opens up your visual--

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:84%
your side vision to little
pathways of inquiring

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:90%
that everybody else has missed.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's the purpose
of being a skeptic.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
But none of the people who
call themselves skeptics

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
have ever even read the
classics of skepticism.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, they're not
operating from that place.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because there's usually
quite an agenda behind it

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.500 align:middle line:90%
in most cases.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: They say
things like, oh, I'm

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:84%
a skeptic about these
near-death experiences.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
chemistry of the brain.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you unpack what
that person just said it is,

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm the person who
doesn't draw conclusions,

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and my conclusion
is such and such.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
they're talking about.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of this
process where I have been

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and my process is
that this being

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:90%
very counterintuitive to me,

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:84%
I finally reached a point where
I just have to say, I give up.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Even knowing that they are
self-contradictory when

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I bring the words to
my mouth, I nonetheless

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
have to say that
there is an afterlife,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:90%
and it's still shocking to me.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
It's something I've
only come to in the--

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.829 align:middle line:84%
and not from any
one thing, but--

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:84%
for example, three, four
years ago, I was in Italy.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And after my lecture,
a surgeon came up.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And you could tell
that he was haunted--

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:84%
not in a negative
way, but that you

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.150 align:middle line:84%
could tell that he had
been through something

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.340 align:middle line:90%
which had really changed him.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So, he led me back to the
corner of this auditorium,

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and he said that
sometime before he

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
had been doing an elective
operative procedure

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
on a fairly young man who
was in overall good health.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So there was no thought
that anything might

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:90%
happen during the surgery.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But in the event, the man had
a cardiac arrest on the table,

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and the surgeon wasn't
able to revive him.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So, he was telling me he
was just so distressed.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
He said he was just
like, oh my god.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And, what am I going
to tell the family?

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Whereupon he said, all of a
sudden the operating room door

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.010 align:middle line:84%
swung open, and a woman
just came in, just raving.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
He said at first, he
thought she was psychotic.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know how when
you're stressed out,

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.557 align:middle line:84%
you can't figure out what
somebody else is saying?

00:18:35.557 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said he couldn't figure
out-- what's this woman saying?

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said he had
to literally look

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.180 align:middle line:84%
into her face like,
what is she saying?

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And he realized she was
saying, my husband is not dead.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.180 align:middle line:84%
She said, I was out
in the waiting room.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And she said, my
husband came to me,

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and he said, you think he's dead
and that I should come in here

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:90%
and tell you that he's not dead.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And the surgeon
told me he was so

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.970 align:middle line:84%
flabbergasted he
doesn't even remember

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:90%
resuming the resuscitation.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:90%
He just went on automatic.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, sure enough,
the heart started beating.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So, he said he was there
in the recovery room

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:84%
when the patient
regained consciousness.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And the patient said to
him, I was out of my body

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
up there, looking
at you down there.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you
thought I was dead.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I kept trying to tell
you I'm not dead.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't hear me, so I
went out into the waiting area,

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and I tried to get
through to my wife

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:84%
to come in here to
tell you I'm not dead.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Now that's one, and it
made an impact on me

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:84%
perhaps because my dad
was a surgeon and all

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:90%
these other things.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But this is something I've
heard from so many physicians--

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
about these incredible
empathic interactions

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:90%
they have with their patients.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:10%
And Alfred North Whitehead
said, in formal logic,

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:10%
a contradiction is regarded
as a signal of defeat.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, but in
the actual process

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
of the inquiry or
pursuit of knowledge,

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that very often is
the self-contradiction

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.830 align:middle line:84%
is an opening into a
new area of knowledge.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that where I would
have to say is an incredible--

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean it just is shocking
to me that at this age,

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I have kind of
come to accept it.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.427 align:middle line:84%
But my mind still
fights against it.

00:20:27.427 --> 00:20:29.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, I hear all
the time these people--

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:90%
and even the pseudoskeptics--

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that you
hear them say all the time is,

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:90%
well, we all want there to be.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And that is just totally bogus.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody wants
there to be an afterlife.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to say that
at many times in my life,

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I've counted myself among
them and maybe still do

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.510 align:middle line:84%
except that it just--
it's at a point to me

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:90%
now where I give up.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's like, to
my utter astonishment,

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.670 align:middle line:90%
I think there is an afterlife.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.875 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And reincarnation?

00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well,
yeah, like I said,

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I knew some of the people who
were so-called the experts

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:15.910 align:middle line:90%
on reincarnation.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that a bit.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:10%
I mean, Ian Stevenson was
a dear friend of mine.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm not talking behind his back.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:90%
This is what-- Ian and I had--

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He and Carol Bowman
had written-- you know--

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.626 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Ian and I
had this conversation.

00:21:27.626 --> 00:21:29.751 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is about
the past lives of children.

00:21:29.751 --> 00:21:32.440 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: I always
said that Ian was not

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:10%
a good critical thinker.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like he was regarded
as such a great scholar

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
because his idea
of scholarship was,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
as long as you got the
footnotes just right,

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
then anything will
pass, especially if it

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:90%
fits his preconceptions, see.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't trust Ian's work
at all and none of the works

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.670 align:middle line:84%
that are done at trying
to prove reincarnation.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But my take on this has come
from my personal experience.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Having kids when you're in your
50s, you observe so closely.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.434 align:middle line:84%
We didn't put any religious
stuff on these kids.

00:22:08.434 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And where they
live, they wouldn't

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:90%
have picked up reincarnation.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And I hear this from
people all the time who

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:90%
have no interest in this stuff.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:84%
My kid is talking
about a previous life.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just a very
hard thing to put together.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Now the big question is,
which everybody wants to know,

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:90%
is there a rational credence?

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Can we lend rational
credence to the afterlife?

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And my answer is
resoundingly yes.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
a big difficulty

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
in this that was brilliantly
pointed out by Plato.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has ever
gotten further along

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
in the thinking about
the rational aspect

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife
question than Plato.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And what Plato says
in the Phaedo, which

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.890 align:middle line:84%
is exactly right on,
he said that when

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.480 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking rationally
about the afterlife question,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
there's always going
to be two factors.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Number one, there
has always got to be

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.315 align:middle line:90%
a story associated with it.

00:23:09.315 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the notion is so
confusing and obscure,

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:84%
that you've got to have some
sort of storyline to get

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:90%
it started.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And they had the
same ones that we do.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, Uncle
Alex, he almost died,

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and he said he got out
of his body and so on.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:90%
It's the same deal.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But then Plato went
on to say, even

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:84%
if you had a billion
stories, it wouldn't add up

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:84%
to rational proof
of an afterlife.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
What you need is some
set of rational concepts

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that can establish the
connection between the stories

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and the statement
there's an afterlife.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And science is not
going to do it.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Parapsychology is
a pseudoscience.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Those are really nice people,
and they are my friends,

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.770 align:middle line:84%
but if you look to
science in the year 2017

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:84%
to give you reassurance
about an afterlife,

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.750 align:middle line:84%
you're barking up
the wrong tree.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.365 align:middle line:84%
The afterlife question is
still a philosophical question.

00:24:07.365 --> 00:24:09.034 align:middle line:84%
It's not yet a
scientific question.

00:24:09.034 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Now in the film, there were
so many beautiful examples

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.220 align:middle line:90%
of this story.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to run
a clip right now.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And what was the name
of the Russian man who--

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.965 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: What was his name?

00:24:18.965 --> 00:24:19.765 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:24:19.765 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
I can't remember,

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, right
offhand either, but I

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.350 align:middle line:84%
loved this particular
segment of the documentary.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
go ahead and watch it.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Great.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:10%
- There was absolute freedom
of your soul and body,

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.496 align:middle line:10%
and this amazed me.

00:24:36.496 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:10%
And this was very
interesting, too.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.620 align:middle line:10%
I was happy to be in
such an experience

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.710 align:middle line:10%
because I could
see their thoughts.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:10%
I could see everything
that was happening.

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:10%
I could smell.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:50.950 align:middle line:10%
I could hear.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:10%
And I could see their thoughts.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.670 align:middle line:10%
This was the main
thing that was very,

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:10%
very making me happy and proud.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.520 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if this word
is good to use here or not,

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.944 align:middle line:10%
but I was proud that I
could see their thoughts.

>>REGINA: That was
so fascinating.

00:25:05.414 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:90%
He could see their thoughts.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But what he's talking
about is even beyond story.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.700 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about a
multisensorial experience.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.177 align:middle line:84%
The cognitive faculties seemed
to be expanded in this--

00:25:19.177 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we think those are
the very things that die when

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.990 align:middle line:90%
the body dies--

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:84%
would be the five
sensory world, but that

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.290 align:middle line:90%
doesn't seem to be the case.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yes, although
under questioning,

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.330 align:middle line:84%
people will tell you that
they're using the word only

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:90%
analogously.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:37.180 align:middle line:84%
People say, for example,
that vision for example--

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
colors are brighter.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Colors are a lot
brighter and even different.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Like, you see colors that don't
exist and that, for example,

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.660 align:middle line:90%
the zoom lens effect--

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
when you think of
something you want

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.060 align:middle line:84%
to see at a great distance,
it's like there's a zoom lens,

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly you're there.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So the cognitive
faculties are enhanced.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And people say that the
words you have to use--

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
closest words you have,

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very
different experience

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:90%
from ordinary vision.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And that it's more of
a cognitive component.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, people
will tell me that you

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:84%
don't need to transfer
yourself from point A

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:90%
to point B to get knowledge.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Space no longer
becomes an issue--

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.405 align:middle line:90%
that it's all informational.

00:26:27.405 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
like he's saying,

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.220 align:middle line:90%
he could see their thoughts.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, and that you
focus on a question and zap

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:34.690 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boom.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So time and space are irrelevant
in that particular place.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:39.244 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:26:39.244 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just nontemporal,
nonspatial.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
sensors seem to still

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:84%
be engaged, at least in
their ability to perceive it

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.575 align:middle line:90%
and bring the knowledge back?

00:26:47.575 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yes.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really
puzzled about this.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:84%
What people will say to
you is that they enter

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:90%
into a state of hyperreality.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the morning, when
you're coming out of a dream,

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.380 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to hold
onto those bizarre images.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.490 align:middle line:90%
What is that all about?

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But quickly it's receding,
and you have the feeling

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.280 align:middle line:90%
you're coming back to reality.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's exactly with people
with near-death experiences

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.460 align:middle line:84%
say, only that they say
that this reality here

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:90%
is the dreams state.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And that as soon as you're
out of this, the details--

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.890 align:middle line:84%
you're quickly
losing track of it.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're entering into this
hyper-real state where space

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and time are not the
orienting factors--

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:37.755 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --but that there
is a language barrier

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.020 align:middle line:84%
that William James, the
American Psychologist,

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:84%
pointed out that-- he said
the main characteristic

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:50.770 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of experience is
ineffability-- that no matter

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.840 align:middle line:84%
how articulate
the people may be,

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.440 align:middle line:84%
they say that there
are no words for this.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So they're forced to
try to describe it

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:90%
using only the words they have.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have another clip.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And these are Carl Jung's
words for the experiences

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:84%
he had had as well,
which I think maybe not

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
everybody understands that he
had also had this experience--

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: He did.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:84%
In 1944, he had a
near-death experience.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:17.393 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's just go
ahead and put it up.

00:28:17.393 --> 00:28:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have someone narrating
his experience of it,

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.332 align:middle line:84%
as he tried to
put it into words.

00:28:22.332 --> 00:28:23.256 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:23.256 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:10%
- At the beginning of
1944, I broke my foot.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:10%
And this misadventure was
followed by a heart attack.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:10%
Extremely strange things
began to happen to me.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:10%
It seemed to me that I
was high up in space.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:10%
Far below, I saw the
globe of the Earth blazed

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.900 align:middle line:10%
in a gloriously blue light.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:10%
I saw the deep blue
sea and the continents.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:10%
I could see the
snow-covered Himalayas.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:10%
I knew that I was at the point
of departing from the Earth.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:10%
The sight of the
Earth from this height

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:10%
was the most glorious
thing I had ever seen.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.670 align:middle line:90%
[END OF VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
this impact his life,

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.830 align:middle line:90%
having had that experience?

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I
know that he was

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.310 align:middle line:84%
interested in such
experiences in his patients

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and that he described
at least one case,

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I remember, of a patient that he
had who had such an experience.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And I guess a lot of other
factors enter into his life,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:84%
too, like the
mythology, and he was

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:27.040 align:middle line:84%
interested in Native American
spirituality and so and so.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't know much
about Jung, actually.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, one thing
that people also say

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.860 align:middle line:84%
is when they first
leave the body--

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get into some
other subjects like suicide,

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:41.030 align:middle line:84%
for example-- but when
people first leave the body,

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.840 align:middle line:84%
some people have a different
orientation in the initial part

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:90%
where it's dark.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And darkness always
seems to bring up fear.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And then fear always seems
to be of the unknown.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:84%
How have you or the
people that you've

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:84%
dealt with perceived that
kind of transitional place?

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yes, a small percentage
of near-death experiences

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:90%
are negative.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And because they are
a small percentage,

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.150 align:middle line:90%
it's harder to study them.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:10%
Generally, people who've
looked a lot into this

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:16.120 align:middle line:10%
say that they're also more
variegated than the positive

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.310 align:middle line:10%
near-death experiences.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.500 align:middle line:84%
The positive ones
are more homogeneous,

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.450 align:middle line:84%
but the negative ones
are kind of spread out.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
cases, for example,

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:30.130 align:middle line:84%
where people-- their first
experience is this darkness,

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's anxiety provoking.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But then, as the
experience goes,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.820 align:middle line:84%
it develops into
the regular ones.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
it seems like it's

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.050 align:middle line:90%
a stage they're passing through.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, but there's that
zone of darkness and anxiety

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.430 align:middle line:90%
in a few people.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it
correlate at all

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.150 align:middle line:90%
to the way in which they died?

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: I don't know.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.120 align:middle line:90%
I haven't noticed any.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
why I was wondering

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.122 align:middle line:84%
if there was any kind
of pattern there at all.

00:30:58.122 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And so another thing
that seems to happen

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:84%
is once people get
to the other side,

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.030 align:middle line:84%
beings get to the other
side, is oftentimes

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:84%
there are entities
waiting for them, right?

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Different
kinds of beings--

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.183 align:middle line:90%
it can be a family member.

00:31:09.183 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Family member, or
very often a being of light,

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:19.420 align:middle line:84%
a compassionate, loving presence
who sort of, very often,

00:31:21.455 --> 00:31:22.255 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:23.055 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:31:23.055 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
have you personally

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.210 align:middle line:84%
come to in
understanding that part

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.420 align:middle line:84%
of the journey of these
other dimensional beings,

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:90%
perhaps being there?

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And what would you
extrapolate that to be--

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.156 align:middle line:84%
the relationship even when
we're in our bodies-- to be?

00:31:39.156 --> 00:31:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I've had a lot
of people describe that light.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And Jewish people often tend
to say, God or an angel.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Christian people tend
to say Jesus or Christ.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whatever your
orientation is, yeah.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, or some people
just say a being of light.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
message that comes across

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.870 align:middle line:84%
from that part is that whatever
they're interested in-- people

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.970 align:middle line:84%
say that what this
being is interested in

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:84%
is how you have learned
to love, and that it's not

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:90%
a judgmental thing.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:18.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people go
into the experience

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:21.100 align:middle line:84%
of a near-death
experience, whatever,

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:90%
kind of expecting judgment.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
interesting thing

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:31.030 align:middle line:84%
how that has come
about in the West--

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:90%
this notion of judgment.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.259 align:middle line:90%
It's the Christian thing.

00:32:34.259 --> 00:32:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say,
the Judeo-Christian ethic

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.872 align:middle line:90%
is where you're less than.

00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:38.830 align:middle line:90%
You're not good enough.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.246 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: What
people don't realize

00:32:40.246 --> 00:32:42.520 align:middle line:84%
about that is that all
that came from Plato.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the
fundamentalist Christians

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.140 align:middle line:84%
would be apoplectic to
hear somebody say that,

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.460 align:middle line:90%
but it's historical fact.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.293 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, how did
he contribute to that?

00:32:50.293 --> 00:32:52.780 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: Scholars of religious
studies will tell you that

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:57.520 align:middle line:10%
the Christian theology mostly
came from Plato's Phaedo,

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.600 align:middle line:10%
which is his--

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.400 align:middle line:10%
and see, Plato was what we
would call today a fascist.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:09.400 align:middle line:10%
He's my hero, but I'm not
sure I'd want to know Plato.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And he was a moralist, right?

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So, his idea was that
it just wasn't fair

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that good people and bad people
went to the same place, which

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.680 align:middle line:90%
was the Greek idea.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.540 align:middle line:84%
You went to the
underworld, and you

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:84%
were in this kind of dazed,
semi-conscious state,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.570 align:middle line:84%
but the bad and the good
were down there mixed.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But Plato says, no, there's
got to be a separation.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Then around the time of Christ,
when the Jewish theologians

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.790 align:middle line:84%
were looking into
the afterlife, they

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:43.510 align:middle line:84%
didn't have much of a
basis in their theology.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.040 align:middle line:90%
So, they borrowed.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.360 align:middle line:84%
They borrowed the Greek notion
of the immortality of the soul.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
their philosopher Philo,

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.420 align:middle line:84%
who was a Platonist, who was
around the time of Jesus--

00:33:55.420 --> 00:34:00.430 align:middle line:84%
he was the Alexandrian
Platonist who was Jewish.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to meld the Jewish
ideas with the Platonic ideas.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And then also, they got
from the Zoroastrians

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.929 align:middle line:84%
the notion of the
resurrection of the body.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:19.330 align:middle line:84%
So these things in
Christianity are actually

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:84%
an amalgam of all these
Zoroastrian and Greek ideas.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.900 align:middle line:90%
And so that's how it came about.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in this, you do
seem to have an ever-watchful,

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.870 align:middle line:90%
almost punishing God--

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:41.620 align:middle line:84%
godhead-- that is recording
your deeds, naughty or nice

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.659 align:middle line:90%
like Santa Claus on some level.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it's worked
its way so deeply

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.050 align:middle line:84%
into our psyche
thousands of years later

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and still exists that
we on our deathbed

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:90%
think, oh my God, I screwed up.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:55.135 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't good enough.

00:34:55.135 --> 00:34:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I thank
God every day that I

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.460 align:middle line:90%
wasn't subjected to religion.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.050 align:middle line:84%
I like to say to people, I
talk to God all the time,

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.315 align:middle line:84%
and he's never said a
word to me about religion.

00:35:04.315 --> 00:35:05.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:05.115 --> 00:35:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm the same.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.920 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was five,
I was like poking holes

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.570 align:middle line:84%
in the stories and
said, but mom, this

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:11.850 align:middle line:90%
doesn't even make sense.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of disconnected
myself from those ideas.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I thought it doesn't
work like that.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So I feel very
fortunate, too, to have

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.765 align:middle line:90%
been a bit of a free agent.

00:35:20.765 --> 00:35:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: I like to say God
is bigger than the Bible.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.010 align:middle line:84%
That's my new book
I'm working on.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.843 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, is it?

00:35:25.843 --> 00:35:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, how many
people, when they

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.780 align:middle line:84%
go through this
judgment process--

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.330 align:middle line:90%
and we'll take a look at it.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I think we might have
a little clip on that--

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:84%
this judgment process feel
inadequate on some level?

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, people
sort of go into it,

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.590 align:middle line:90%
see, expecting to be judged.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:48.582 align:middle line:10%
And George Ritchie, who
you see on this film, was--

00:35:48.582 --> 00:35:49.540 align:middle line:10%
he said-- there he was.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.920 align:middle line:10%
He was 20 years old.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.090 align:middle line:10%
And he had been raised in this
very strict, fundamentalist

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:10%
Presbyterianism.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there
he was, 20 years old,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:84%
all the things he'd
ever done in his life

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.060 align:middle line:84%
were around him in this
panorama in the presence

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.220 align:middle line:90%
of this being of complete love.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said he was expecting
to be taken to task.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.300 align:middle line:10%
And he said it wasn't that way--

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:10%
that it's kind of like
an exploration process.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.980 align:middle line:84%
This life review is
that you are just

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:28.810 align:middle line:84%
kind of-- it's not that somebody
is there to be on your case.

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:84%
It's that you're looking
at it and reflecting on it.

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.282 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.282 --> 00:36:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember at one
point in the documentary,

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:39.220 align:middle line:84%
it was saying that oftentimes
the things you think were

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.311 align:middle line:84%
your big accomplishments
in life really--

00:36:42.311 --> 00:36:43.810 align:middle line:84%
those aren't the
things that show up

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.670 align:middle line:84%
as having been meaningful
in this process--

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:84%
where some tiny act of just
a little act of kindness

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:52.420 align:middle line:84%
or consideration to someone
turns out to be something

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.634 align:middle line:90%
that really stands out.

00:36:53.634 --> 00:36:54.550 align:middle line:90%

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.460 align:middle line:84%
People say that it's not
the big accomplishments

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.820 align:middle line:84%
they had in mind that come
forth in this life review.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.990 align:middle line:84%
That it's-- very often they
don't even remember the things

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.100 align:middle line:90%
that was--

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.245 align:middle line:84%
very often an act
of kindness you

00:37:08.245 --> 00:37:11.250 align:middle line:84%
had done to someone without
even thinking about it.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
well, we're going

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to take a little
look at a clip that

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:18.100 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the presence of
the beings on the other side

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and how they'll
interact with someone.

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a peak.

I might have been, or--

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:41.440 align:middle line:10%

>>REGINA: Well, now,
what was interesting--

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I believe she is the one who
had committed suicide, correct?

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: She did.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:53.770 align:middle line:90%
She made a suicide attempt.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think she
shot herself in the chest.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.396 align:middle line:90%

into the back story of why she

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:10%
because oftentimes in the world
of new age philosophy and such,

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.590 align:middle line:10%
if you time attempt to take
your life that you somehow--

or the people who are
smoking themselves to death.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we're
all self-destructive.

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that God is
going to make a discrimination

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.520 align:middle line:84%
whether somebody takes
30 minutes to do it

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:08.420 align:middle line:84%
with pills or 30 years with
cigarettes is just ridiculous.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.090 align:middle line:84%
People's ideas of
suicide, basically,

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:12.920 align:middle line:84%
are based about
their own guilt. They

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:84%
don't want to feel
guilty, because what

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.764 align:middle line:84%
if I contribute to this
other person's decision.

00:39:18.764 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So they've got to
say, oh, there's

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.760 align:middle line:84%
some kind of cosmological
thing about it.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:32.300 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I think
that self-destruction

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:90%
is what we're looking at here.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And people who've had
near-death experiences

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.800 align:middle line:84%
as a result of a suicide
attempt come back

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and they tell me they'd
never do it again,

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.740 align:middle line:84%
but not because they felt
that they were going to end up

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:52.640 align:middle line:84%
in some terrible
hell, but because it's

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:58.115 align:middle line:84%
kind of like walking out of
the movie before the end.

00:39:58.115 --> 00:39:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
that's a good point.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.569 align:middle line:84%

talking about suicide

00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:03.860 align:middle line:90%

try to kill yourself
and you succeed,

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:20.760 align:middle line:10%
somehow you're going to have
to go through everything that

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.750 align:middle line:10%
was painful in your life and
then have to go from the point

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:10%
where you killed yourself also.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.604 align:middle line:90%

a distinguishing factor

00:40:40.544 --> 00:40:42.510 align:middle line:84%
between that and
what she's saying

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:45.030 align:middle line:84%

prematurely and quickly?

any sort of eternal punishment.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.280 align:middle line:90%
It's just like--

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.238 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've just

00:40:58.238 --> 00:41:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: You've got to
go through it again.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.910 align:middle line:90%
There's no words for this.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.370 align:middle line:84%
But if I would try
to word it, I would

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.930 align:middle line:84%
say-- it's kind of
like-- what people

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:09.891 align:middle line:84%
tell me is that after
a suicide attempt,

00:41:09.891 --> 00:41:12.390 align:middle line:84%
that when they get back, they
say they wouldn't do it again.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they had
the sense that if it

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:18.060 align:middle line:84%
had gone through to completion,
they would be kind of placed

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.790 align:middle line:84%
on a side track--
not the punishment

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:23.250 align:middle line:90%
but a learning experience.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And that they would have to see
the consequence of their action

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.300 align:middle line:90%
on all their loved ones--

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.650 align:middle line:84%
like the feelings
that they had brought

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:39.270 align:middle line:84%
about, which would be part of
the life review anyway, right?

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you do to somebody
else that's unkind,

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.770 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see from
their perspective in this life

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:90%
review.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:48.824 --> 00:41:49.740 align:middle line:90%
That would bring pain.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.031 align:middle line:84%
That would bring guilt. That
would kind of get you back

00:41:52.031 --> 00:41:54.180 align:middle line:90%
on the wheel to try again.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.950 align:middle line:84%
What about the
notion of assisted

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.740 align:middle line:84%
suicide, where you've
just had it-- you can't

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.330 align:middle line:90%
take the suffering any longer?

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, the 'funda' Christians are
one of the most inimical groups

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.390 align:middle line:90%
of people in our society to me.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:84%
They want to lay down the
laws for the rest of us.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And-- oh my god, what
a foul group of people.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.940 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Thank god we live in
the United States.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So at least, for the
present, we've escaped them.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But they're still
trying to take over.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:36.450 align:middle line:84%
They want to lay down
their moral laws, which

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.670 align:middle line:90%
they don't follow very well.

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I mean,
I just think it's--

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:47.010 align:middle line:84%
somebody who has a
terminal illness--

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:51.720 align:middle line:84%
if you're asking me
about assisted suicide,

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I think that--

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I look at it a different way.

00:42:56.430 --> 00:43:00.300 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the
law, for example,

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I ask myself, what would be
the long-term cumulative effect

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:12.240 align:middle line:84%
on physicians who assisted
in assisted suicide.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.340 align:middle line:84%
See, that's the
way I think of it.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:21.210 align:middle line:84%
To me, I would not be
against the idea based

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:26.100 align:middle line:84%
on it should be withheld from
somebody who is terminally ill

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and wants to take that course so
as to prevent further suffering

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.180 align:middle line:84%
or to free up their
families from all--

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:36.840 align:middle line:90%
so that, I'm on board with.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:40.050 align:middle line:84%
The idea of whether it
would be a good thing

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.740 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate that
into the medical world--

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.092 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the burden
it puts on the doctors?

00:43:46.092 --> 00:43:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: The physician.

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.508 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:43:49.508 --> 00:43:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: So that's
my take on it.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad I'm not one of the
ones that makes that decision.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think the
ones who do assist,

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.599 align:middle line:84%
it's because they are
philosophically in alignment

00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and have agreed to be
part of that process.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.973 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: There's
another part of this.

00:44:04.973 --> 00:44:10.125 align:middle line:84%
It sounds shocking, but anybody
who knows about the traditions

00:44:10.125 --> 00:44:14.400 align:middle line:84%
about care for the terminally
ill and so on, it's--

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:22.320 align:middle line:84%
the fact is, people give
the dose to ease people out,

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.370 align:middle line:90%
and it's part of the culture.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But I guess it's
something you're not

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:34.185 align:middle line:84%
supposed to talk about much, but
it's already done in reality.

00:44:34.185 --> 00:44:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, people with
these moralistic ideas

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:45.825 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
inflict on the rest of us

00:44:45.825 --> 00:44:47.520 align:middle line:90%
are very annoying to me.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.807 align:middle line:90%


00:44:49.807 --> 00:44:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
save a little time

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:53.445 align:middle line:84%
to talk about a new
project you're working on,

00:44:53.445 --> 00:44:55.570 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to have
later conversation about.

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But before that,
what, to you, are

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.510 align:middle line:84%
some of the-- in terms of
the afterlife-- the most

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:04.560 align:middle line:84%
shocking, or beautiful, and
kind of confirming cases

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.930 align:middle line:90%
that you ever experienced?

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Oh, wow--

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just so many.

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are there a
couple that just jump out?

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, the one
that always jumps out

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.480 align:middle line:84%
for me is Dr.
George Ritchie, who

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.800 align:middle line:10%
was the finest human being
I ever knew in my life.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:24.810 align:middle line:84%
In 1965, I was an undergraduate
philosophy student at UVA.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And I heard from
one of my professors

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.670 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. George Ritchie, who
was a professor of psychiatry

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:33.840 align:middle line:84%
there at UVA, had had
such an experience.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason I was
interested in this

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:39.390 align:middle line:84%
was that I knew
about the experiences

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:41.760 align:middle line:84%
from my study of
Greek philosophy.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Because Plato, and
Democritus, and a lot

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:47.760 align:middle line:84%
of the Greek philosophers were
interested in these things.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But George had this
phenomenal experience.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.200 align:middle line:90%
He was 20 years old.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:58.170 align:middle line:10%
He was pronounced dead of
double lobar pneumonia in 1943.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.880 align:middle line:84%
He was apparently dead for at
least nine minutes, whereupon

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.320 align:middle line:84%
the ward boy talked the
doctor, Dr. Francie,

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.730 align:middle line:84%
into injecting George into
the heart with adrenaline,

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:13.290 align:middle line:90%
and it brought George back.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And George had this
really amazing experience

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.590 align:middle line:84%
which changed my
life in the sense

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that hearing it from
George, I didn't

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.910 align:middle line:84%
know whether it
was quote, "real"

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:28.600 align:middle line:84%
or not, but what I knew was
that George Ritchie was real

He was also not wishy-washy.

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I say a nice, sweet
person, but he was firm, too.

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:40.620 align:middle line:90%
He had boundaries.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Once in a while, he'd blow up.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:46.690 align:middle line:84%
But just overall, the finest

>>MOODY: It was a
turning point in my life.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And George later became
one of my best friends.

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he was a great guy.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've been doing
this now for a lot of years.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Since 1962
was when I found out

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:09.210 align:middle line:84%
about near-death experiences
in reading Plato's Republic.

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet you are, in
the classic sense of the word,

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:14.430 align:middle line:90%
a skeptic at heart.

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, you
were in utter astonishment

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:21.660 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we apparently
hop back on the wheel again.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.280 align:middle line:84%
All these things are
a surprise to you.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So with all of this, two
questions-- what would

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.700 align:middle line:84%
you say would be your
most profound observation

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.215 align:middle line:90%
about that particular phenomena?

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.380 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like to know that.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, I want to know
how you feel about your own life

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and how you feel about your
own death when that time comes.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, well number
one, as a logician,

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.260 align:middle line:84%
when I teach logic,
one of the things

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I tell my students is, always
draw the minimal inference

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:54.030 align:middle line:84%
you can out of a
set of information.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:48:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if you draw the most
modest conclusion that you

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:03.720 align:middle line:90%
possibly can, then you're safe.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And so let's think of the
near-death experience,

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and let's just take the
life-after-death question out

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:13.330 align:middle line:84%
of the picture for
a moment and ask,

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:16.170 align:middle line:84%
is there anything that
is utterly stunning

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and its implications
that we can draw

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.890 align:middle line:84%
from the near-death experience
as an absolute certainty?

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:26.250 align:middle line:90%
And I say absolutely there is.

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
what we can draw

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:34.380 align:middle line:84%
from the near-death experience
is the conclusion that

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:40.410 align:middle line:84%
apparently, for many of us,
life is a two-phase process.

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:45.690 align:middle line:84%
If you think of it, apparently,
you lived your life forward

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.150 align:middle line:90%
as the actor or protagonist.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's this
180 degree turnaround.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And in a timeless state, you
re-experience that same action

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:02.070 align:middle line:84%
from the point of view
of the other characters.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Now think about it.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:10.310 align:middle line:84%
At least for some of us,
life is a two-phase process.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you want
to ask, well, does

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that mean that people who
have a near-death experience,

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:20.390 align:middle line:84%
in return, are therefore in a
kind of third phase of life?

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting that
the Greeks thought they were.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Heraclitus, who was one of
the pre-Socratic philosophers,

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:30.440 align:middle line:84%
said that the people who have
what we call a near-death

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.380 align:middle line:84%
experience are
appointed, he said,

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to watch over the
living and the dead--

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that they are kind of
intermediary beings.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think you've probably
known enough of them,

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:44.840 align:middle line:84%
like Evan and so on, to
know that they kind of are.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think people who have
near-death experiences come

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:53.210 align:middle line:84%
back in this sort of different
state from the rest of us.

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:54.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And then in terms you
were asking about the way

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:57.534 align:middle line:90%
it's impacted my life-?

00:49:57.534 --> 00:49:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I wanted to--

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, after all
of this, certainly

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:04.190 align:middle line:84%
you have some perhaps
impression, if not expectation,

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.550 align:middle line:84%
of what that process
will be like.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, it's
hard for me to say

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:14.750 align:middle line:84%
what impact the near-death
experiences have had on my life

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:18.890 align:middle line:84%
because I found out about
them when I was so young.

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to disentangle
that string of influences

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:28.100 align:middle line:84%
in my life from all the other
things that have happened.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And also because I do seem
to be constitutionally

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:37.414 align:middle line:84%
unable to believe that
there's life after death.

00:50:37.414 --> 00:50:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, when you say
that you believe something,

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:42.590 align:middle line:84%
it's a kind of
internalization of it

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.310 align:middle line:90%
that I don't understand that.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I am really
a Pyrrhonian skeptic.

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.295 align:middle line:90%
And I think everybody is.

00:50:49.295 --> 00:50:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, when
you hear somebody say,

00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:54.145 align:middle line:84%
oh, I believe this or I believe
that, as a psychiatrist,

00:50:54.145 --> 00:50:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I look at that and say,
what's really going on

00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:00.320 align:middle line:84%
is that they're just as unsure
as I am deep down, so they're

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:04.190 align:middle line:84%
trying to give themself
assurance by saying that,

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:05.750 align:middle line:90%
and it's baloney.

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, number one, either
there is an afterlife or not.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what anybody's
belief about it is, right?

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So, I can't tell
you that I believe

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:19.240 align:middle line:90%
that there's an afterlife.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.820 align:middle line:84%
What I can tell you is that
I have been driven by my life

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:30.860 align:middle line:84%
experience to be in a
position where I'm just like--

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.370 align:middle line:84%
that words have almost
been extruded from me

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:35.840 align:middle line:90%
by my experiences.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Because I realize--

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:39.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like a
surrender, almost, to evidence.

00:51:39.395 --> 00:51:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yeah, although
I'm still fighting it.

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And evidence also is a
funny word with this.

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Because the real difficulty
with the rational pursuit

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife
question is that there

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:56.150 align:middle line:84%
isn't any definition of what
evidence would be, right?

00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:01.610 align:middle line:84%
The real problem is
that if sentence,

00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:05.000 align:middle line:84%
there is life after death
doesn't make any sense, which

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.470 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't, then the sentence,
there is evidence of life

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:11.840 align:middle line:84%
after death doesn't
make any sense either.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So the fact is
that [INAUDIBLE] is

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.900 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
questions of human existence,

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:21.800 align:middle line:84%
number one, and a very profound
and important philosophical

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.760 align:middle line:84%
question; number three, not a
scientific question-- not yet.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:27.430 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: But it is a
conceptual question

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:31.830 align:middle line:90%
and a philosophical question.

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And I am happy to
say here that I

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:41.540 align:middle line:84%
have made a major breakthrough
on the rational investigation

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.820 align:middle line:90%
of the afterlife question.

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Now number one, the primary
resisters to this new discovery

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.310 align:middle line:84%
is going to be what I call
the afterlife establishment--

00:52:55.310 --> 00:53:01.880 align:middle line:84%
the parapsychologists and not
so much the pseudoskeptics.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.220 align:middle line:84%
They will resist it, too,
but basically it's this.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:10.020 align:middle line:10%
The real problem of the
afterlife in the rational terms

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.900 align:middle line:10%
was brilliantly
stated by David Hume,

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.440 align:middle line:10%
who was one of the founders
of what we call today

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.330 align:middle line:10%
the scientific mind.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:20.570 align:middle line:10%
He lived from 1711 to 1776.

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:22.460 align:middle line:10%
He was a friend of Ben Franklin.

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:29.450 align:middle line:84%
He was a Scotch philosopher
who articulated some problems

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:32.570 align:middle line:84%
with the notion of induction
and inductive logic

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:37.250 align:middle line:84%
like in science and also
with the notion of causation.

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So basically, Hume
was asked to write

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.230 align:middle line:84%
an essay on the
afterlife question,

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:43.650 align:middle line:90%
and this is what he said.

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow these
words as I say them,

00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:50.690 align:middle line:84%
you will see that he
was absolutely right on.

00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Hume said by the
mere light of reason,

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:58.407 align:middle line:84%
it seems difficult to prove
the immortality of the soul.

00:53:58.407 --> 00:53:59.615 align:middle line:90%
Now that's an understatement.

00:53:59.615 --> 00:54:01.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By the
mere light of reason.

00:54:01.235 --> 00:54:02.151 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: That's right.

00:54:02.151 --> 00:54:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And then he went ahead to
say, some new species of logic

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:12.290 align:middle line:84%
is required for that purpose and
some new faculties of the mind

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:16.490 align:middle line:84%
that they may enable us
to comprehend that logic.

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And when Hume said that, he
was probably being ironic.

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And probably what he meant
is that it's impossible.

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But either way, he got the
criterion-- he nailed it down.

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:28.790 align:middle line:84%
That is the fact, if you
think about this logically.

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Now number one, not
everybody is really

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:35.090 align:middle line:84%
interested in the rational
proof of an afterlife.

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people who say
that they are or are not really.

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Because what they want
is some more stories.

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:44.310 align:middle line:84%
They just want to hear more
of the same kind of stories

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.110 align:middle line:90%
and all.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But as Plato pointed out, if
you had a billion stories,

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.960 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't-- you've got to
have some sort of conceptual

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.070 align:middle line:90%
apparatus.

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Now what I can confidently say
is I've solved that problem.

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:90%


00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't do it in relation
to the afterlife question.

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:06.170 align:middle line:84%
It's that my interest is in
logic, and the way you think,

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and philosophy of
language and so on.

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I've
solved Hume's problem.

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done is
that I've developed

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:17.990 align:middle line:84%
a set of rational
principles that

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:22.910 align:middle line:84%
enable us to think
logically about things

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that, in the linguistic
sense, don't make any sense.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, I realized 23,
24 years ago, that eventually,

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:37.190 align:middle line:84%
somebody who had learned
my system of logic

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:41.180 align:middle line:84%
would just happen to have
a near-death experience.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And for reasons that I
could explain to you--

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:46.760 align:middle line:84%
it would take a while-- but
just to get to the point--

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that I realized that
somebody in that situation--

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:56.420 align:middle line:84%
that going into the near-death
experience with a preexisting

00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.520 align:middle line:84%
set of rules and
principles for thinking

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:03.470 align:middle line:84%
about nonsensical things
would be forced or compelled

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:07.550 align:middle line:84%
to articulate that
experience in a new way that

00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:09.320 align:middle line:90%
differs from the ordinary.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:14.600 align:middle line:84%
The reason is, near-death
experiences or stories are

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.640 align:middle line:90%
nonsensical travel narratives.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the presupposition is
number one, there are no words.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And also, it was not
in time and space.

00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But the closest account
they can give us

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.920 align:middle line:90%
is that I got out of my body.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I went through a
tunnel into a light.

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I came back to my body
and returned to life.

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:36.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a travel narrative.

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.340 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
way to understand

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.930 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of a
travel narrative

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:41.910 align:middle line:90%
as if there's no time and space.

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:45.030 align:middle line:90%
So there's that structural flaw.

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.174 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's that conundrum.

00:56:45.174 --> 00:56:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But you said, in
Hume's statement,

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:48.690 align:middle line:84%
we'd have to have
some new faculty.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So you're bringing into
play the notion of a faculty

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that you've observed
and now dissected

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:56.700 align:middle line:84%
to add rational proof
to the afterlife?

00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Yes, you can
absolutely open up

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:02.690 align:middle line:84%
cognitive faculties of your mind
that you didn't know you had.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Now not a lot of people-- it's
like America, we've gotten--

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.770 align:middle line:90%
we know more--

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:10.660 align:middle line:84%
yet, it's all instant
gratification there, right?

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
are going to hear that

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and they say, oh it's a
new way to open my mind,

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.960 align:middle line:90%
a new way of om or whatever.

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not that.

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.840 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
takes application.

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:28.490 align:middle line:84%
But you can go through a way
of reformatting your mind

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:32.070 align:middle line:84%
where you open up--
you have in there-- you

00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:34.170 align:middle line:84%
have cognitive
faculties that you

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:37.050 align:middle line:84%
don't know that
you have that have

00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:42.130 align:middle line:84%
to do with processing language
that is unintelligible.

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And so once you open
that up, then you

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:48.510 align:middle line:84%
have new ways of thinking
about the afterlife.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:52.320 align:middle line:84%
To make a long story
short, I knew full well

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:58.560 align:middle line:84%
that eventually this was going
to happen October 15, 2015.

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I got a call from this
guy-- a really wonderful man

00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:06.450 align:middle line:84%
who's a renowned
artist and scientist.

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And he had been in
my nonsense course--

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.540 align:middle line:84%
maybe six, seven,
eight years before.

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And he was calling me
then not about that

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:17.130 align:middle line:84%
but about his
near-death experience.

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:20.410 align:middle line:10%
He had developed this
horrific infection--

00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:24.030 align:middle line:10%
just horrible-- H1N1 flu.

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:26.430 align:middle line:10%
And I just won't go
into the details.

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:28.140 align:middle line:90%
It was gosh awful.

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But during that period, I think
he had three cardiac arrests

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:32.440 align:middle line:90%
and near-death experiences.

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
point of the call.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me about all
this and in a very weak voice.

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, his
voice became clear,

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:43.890 align:middle line:90%
and it's like this energy.

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and Raymond, he
said, when I was over there,

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:48.930 align:middle line:84%
he said, my mind
went back to what

00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:50.160 align:middle line:90%
you said about the nonsense.

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I realized
you were right.

00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And to quote him
exactly he said,

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I realized that in order
to understand how that

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.980 align:middle line:90%
is connected to this world--

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.170 align:middle line:84%
then, to use his
exact words, he said,

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:08.100 align:middle line:84%
"You've got to take the
unintelligibility axis

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.740 align:middle line:90%
into account."

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this not
to brag but to challenge.

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I have made a breakthrough
in the rational investigation

00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:18.130 align:middle line:90%
of the afterlife.

00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:21.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be appealing
to the parapsychologists.

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:26.460 align:middle line:84%
What they are basically into is
stories, however they want to--

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.130 align:middle line:90%
this is not stories.

00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's more conceptual.

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:31.320 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:34.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to have
that conversation next time.

00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Great.

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because the point--

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:38.128 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
to the bottom of this

00:59:38.128 --> 00:59:41.255 align:middle line:84%
and, whether you like it or
not, you're going to prove--

00:59:41.255 --> 00:59:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Not prove that
there's an afterlife

00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:47.670 align:middle line:84%
but to open up a new way
to investigate the question

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and to do it by opening
faculties of your mind

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't know you
have and pointing out

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:57.270 align:middle line:84%
to you principles of reason
that are obvious once you think

00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:00.030 align:middle line:84%
about them but that were
ruled out, essentially,

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:03.390 align:middle line:84%
by Aristotle's
compulsive nature.

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Plato was well on the
way to understanding

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.830 align:middle line:84%
how meaningless, unintelligible
language operates

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:14.580 align:middle line:90%
in his dialogue the Parmenides.

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle, who codified
logic, predicated it

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:22.320 align:middle line:84%
on literal meaning and
true or false statements.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So you can't process the
afterlife question that way.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back to what
Plato was trying to do

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and you add some rules
and provisions to how

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:34.770 align:middle line:84%
to think about things
that don't make sense,

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:38.100 align:middle line:84%
then you've got to know what--
so I am going to say that,

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.640 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I'll make that challenge.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:41.820 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you all my material.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you some exercises--
sense exercises and all--

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.702 align:middle line:84%
that you can do with
this, and we'll see.

01:00:48.702 --> 01:00:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can
tell you are always

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:54.545 align:middle line:84%
going to withhold the
conclusion on one level.

01:00:54.545 --> 01:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, because it's
the best way to proceed.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It keeps
the exploration,

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.660 align:middle line:84%
the peripheral
exploration alive.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: It does.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I understand
what you're saying.

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: It does.

01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
reality also is, you

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.805 align:middle line:84%
can't deny there's
something to this.

01:01:08.805 --> 01:01:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Well, I didn't know
what to think in those terms.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.560 align:middle line:84%
But where I am
now is, I give up.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.360 align:middle line:90%
It's more like--

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:15.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Surrender.

01:01:15.675 --> 01:01:17.591 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: --not that I've
reached a conclusion.

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I can't figure
out any way out of this

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
without having to say in a
stammering fashion that yeah,

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.915 align:middle line:90%
there is an afterlife.

01:01:27.915 --> 01:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note, we've
got you saying it on camera.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And so until next time,
thank you so much, Raymond.

01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Thank you.

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:36.710 align:middle line:90%
It's been great.

01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love the fact
that your mind is as it is.

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:43.440 align:middle line:10%
Because for all the
people that have

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.760 align:middle line:10%
conflicts over the notion of
spirituality and religion.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.040 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: The most
important thing

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.480 align:middle line:10%
is to admit that
you're ignorant.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's true.

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.980 align:middle line:10%
>>MOODY: And I am ignorant.

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:55.290 align:middle line:10%
And I am pleased that, to
me, the whole process of--

01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:57.870 align:middle line:10%
the intellectual
process is just fine.

01:01:57.870 --> 01:02:01.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying as best I can
to learn as much as I can,

01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:05.716 align:middle line:84%
but I realize that
there's not much I can do.

01:02:05.716 --> 01:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that,
thank you so much.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Thank you.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I look forward
to our next conversation.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MOODY: Me, too!

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's going
to be a complex one.

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go in places
I haven't been before,

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.330 align:middle line:90%
so I'm looking forward to it.

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MOODY: Maybe you should get
some consultants on it, too.

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, your husband
could look at it.

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, he
would love that.

01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
When you send us the
material, he'll--

>>REGINA: So meanwhile, again,
I cannot recommend the film that

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.779 align:middle line:10%
we've just shown
you clips of enough.

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:31.320 align:middle line:10%
It's really beautiful

01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you
