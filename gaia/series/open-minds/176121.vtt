00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: There's
more than one way to access

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:10%
the unhealed parts
of the subconscious,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:10%
particularly where it becomes
symptomatic in the human body.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the subtle
but profound means

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.170 align:middle line:84%
of bringing this trauma to the
surface is via tuning forks.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:10%
Eileen Day McKusick
states that sound

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:10%
can vibrate these out of balance
frequencies into attunement.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Which I'm such a fan of
all vibrational therapies.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And this one sometimes doesn't
get quite as much notice

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:90%
as the others.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
But really, none of them
are getting enough exposure

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:90%
in this world today.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But what's so brilliant is
there are people like you who

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.852 align:middle line:84%
understand this who are involved
in now in scientific studies

00:00:58.852 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and such that are starting
to bring this around

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
for left brained people who
simply refuse to believe

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:90%
that we are energetic beings.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>EILEEN DAY MCKUSICK: Yes.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've spent
a lot of years trying

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:84%
to prove the usefulness of
this particular modality

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.391 align:middle line:84%
in bringing people into
attunement, literally.

00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:17.307 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Right.

00:01:17.307 --> 00:01:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.745 align:middle line:84%
Tuning people up,
giving people tune-ups.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tune-ups.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's just kind of start at the
beginning and talk about that,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we're
fundamentally energetic systems

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that every cell is simply
sharing information,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.345 align:middle line:84%
but it's happening via
electromagnetic communication.

00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.636 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've
really been taught

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
to think of ourselves in
chemical mechanical terms.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So if something goes wrong,
you know, it's drugs or surgery

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:90%
to treat you at that level.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:10%
What I've observed
through my work

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:10%
is that we're also electric
and magnetic and vibrational.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
We're really informational
and energetic beams

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:90%
at our most fundamental level.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring in the
additional element of plasma,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:84%
the sort of fire, electricity,
light element into our being,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
it gives you a
whole new dimension

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.444 align:middle line:84%
to work with that's
actually more fundamental.

00:02:13.444 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.609 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're looking
at chemical structures

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
in the body, they
are simply part

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
of that field, those
informational fields

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:90%
and frequencies.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Right.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.289 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why
they do what they do.

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:10%
They carry a fundamental
frequency with them

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:10%
that can balance a
different frequency.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:10%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So yeah, so
chemicals are still

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:10%
just information and frequency.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:10%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
Right, and you know,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:10%
Jerry Tennant was saying on your
show that it's really physics,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:10%
you know.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:84%
That when molecules
switch partnering

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.002 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of thing, it's
really electrons moving around.

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:90%
It's very much physics.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the work that
I do with sound,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
someone recently called
it physics based medicine.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And I really
love that terminology,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:84%
because that's
really what it is.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:84%
We're using the
physics principles

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
of resonance and entrainment
to find areas in the body

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:84%
where the vibrations
are out of tune.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:10%
And then simply by bringing
a pure tone, a simple tuning

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.720 align:middle line:10%
fork, you know, it's an
acoustic frequency generator,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.110 align:middle line:10%
into these areas of
dissonance, the body

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.200 align:middle line:10%
hears and recognizes
it's own distortion

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:10%
and will actually
spontaneously auto tune itself.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're really
designed to be in harmony.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And we just need the right
inputs to help us to get there.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And so coherent sound is
a beautiful, elegant input

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.776 align:middle line:90%
to make that happen.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you've been
jumping on the new circuit,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:90%
the electric universe circuit.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And now there's kind
of a mirror image

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.504 align:middle line:84%
of that one by a slightly
different name, I believe,

00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:90%
that's happening in England.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:10%
And it's kind of bouncing
between US and England,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:10%
with all of the kind of
greats in that field, David

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.926 align:middle line:10%
Talbot and some of the
others whom I've interviewed.

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're showing
up in the scene too.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
important to stress

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:84%
that there is nothing that
operates independently

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:90%
outside of the whole.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:10%
And we are a reflection of
the whole hermetic axiom,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:10%
as above, so below.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about a
little bit of our being

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.610 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of that cosmology,
that it has its own need

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:84%
to stay in tune with
itself all the time just

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:84%
for the planets to be able
to rotate around one another.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.419 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that fractal
expression of patterns.

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Well,
you know, when I first

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.966 align:middle line:84%
started working
with tuning forks,

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I just worked right
over the body.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And 10 years in-- and it was
just a hobby for many years,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I was involved in
the food business--

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I started discovering that
there was energy and information

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And made the curious discovery
that about five to six feet

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:84%
away from the body
there appeared

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:84%
to be like in a membrane
almost, where there

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:84%
was greater resistance,
what felt to me like greater

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:90%
electrical charge.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And as I was exploring
working in the field

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and encountering the
phenomenon that I did,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
sense of charge, of
resistance, of the tuning

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:84%
fork acting like
a magnet and being

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
able to move these areas
of charge and resistance

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
around, I was so
puzzled, you know.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
I was just like, what is this
stuff that I'm encountering?

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And what laws of physics
are allowing a tuning fork

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to interact with it
and move it around?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had just so many questions
that I decided to go to school,

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:84%
go to college as an adult. I
never went out of high school.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.897 align:middle line:84%
And ended up writing a master's
thesis about my experience,

00:05:28.897 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:84%
because I was trying
to understand it.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.021 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've got
a lot of curiosity

00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of questions.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.850 align:middle line:10%
And so in my search
to understand

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:10%
what I was encountering, I came
across the concept of plasma.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.680 align:middle line:10%
And then that led to
electric universe theory.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:10%
And I went down the plasma
rabbit hole, you know.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:10%
I spent months
reading everything

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:10%
I possibly could about it.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to turn it
into an independent study

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.484 align:middle line:90%
for my master's thesis.

00:05:53.484 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:10%
And then it informed
my master's thesis,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:10%
which then informed my book.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:10%
But what I discovered
was exactly that.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:10%
That as above, so below.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And this idea that
electric universe theory

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
basically says that
everything is electric.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, that this gravity
model is actually incorrect.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the hot gas
that NASA is always describing

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:90%
is actually plasma.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Plasma is just gas where
the ions are separated

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
from electrons and there's a
free-- it conducts electricity.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So the solar wind is a plasma,
Northern Lights are a plasma.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:84%
The magnetosphere, you
know, the bubble that

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
surrounds the Earth, there's
a double layer plasma membrane

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
there that protects the Earth
from too much solar radiation

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.470 align:middle line:90%
and contains our atmosphere.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The sun also has
one, the heliosphere.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.910 align:middle line:84%
The outer boundaries
of the solar system

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:84%
is this double layer
plasma membrane.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And so fractally, that really
relates to the human idea

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:84%
that anything that has
an electric current

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:84%
has a magnetic field and
that these magnetic fields

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:90%
have boundaries.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
big ahas that came

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
from understanding the
electrical nature of our bodies

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and how that correlated
to the electrical nature

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And in that, there is
a kind of connectivity.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Because in solid,
liquid, and gas,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
in that cosmology,
big bang cosmology,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.680 align:middle line:84%
there's just a tremendous amount
of separation and emptiness.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized that
the same electricity

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.999 align:middle line:84%
that was powering the stars
was causing my heart to beat--

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's just where I
was going to go next, actually.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's the same.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: It's
a sense of unification

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.460 align:middle line:84%
of like, wow, it's all electric,
in a sea of electromagnetism.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm connected to
all that is in a way

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:90%
that my left brain went yes.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, we can
talk about all is one

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and you know sort of
metaphysical blah, blah, blah,

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:84%
but then we have
this cosmology that

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.650 align:middle line:84%
says space is an empty
vacuum and everything

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
is random and disconnected
and chaotic and disconnected.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And so to actually encounter
a cosmology of light

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and connection, I never had
to read another self-help book

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Because I'd
been reading self-help books

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.386 align:middle line:84%
for years and years
and years and was like,

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is not
solving the problem.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
And when I realized

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
that it was the
cosmology, you know,

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
that kind of overarching
unexamined story

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that was informing my Cartesian
anxiety and depression,

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and being able to see
wow, it's all electric

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's all
electrically connected.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rather than
disconnected pieces

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.110 align:middle line:84%
where you throw one thing
here and another thing there

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:90%
and see if it sticks.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's interesting,
because you can even

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:84%
take it down to an atomic level
and it all looks the same.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
All looks the same.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.985 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It starts
looking-- depending

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:10%
on our particular solar
system and a given element,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:10%
I think our solar
system is reflected

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.865 align:middle line:10%
in I think it's fluorine.

00:08:42.865 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:10%
The element of fluorine,
it looks exactly the same.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:10%
The number of planets
and the amount

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:10%
of space between the planets
and distance between them

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:10%
and the sun is the same
as the atomic structure

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.686 align:middle line:10%
of that particular element.

00:08:53.686 --> 00:08:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So even if you're taking
it up to an element that's

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
very heavy, you know,
like uranium or something,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:90%
it's still all space.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
hardest thing, I think,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:84%
for almost all humans, even
those who understand it well,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:90%
to get their minds around.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:84%
That there is
nothing in this room

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:90%
in your body or mine but space.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.885 align:middle line:84%
There's such an infinitesimal
amount of matter.

00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we only try to
affect matter in our lives,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:84%
in our healing, in our pleasure
and senses and so forth.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.406 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Right.

00:09:28.406 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so to be able to
disturb or bring into coherence

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:84%
the little bit of matter that is
in that whole field in between

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:84%
through what you do,
for example, that

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.519 align:middle line:84%
has to be a really, to you, a
very joyful, beautiful thing.

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Oh, yeah.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.520 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's so--

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:84%
this method that I kind of
discovered, it's so elegant.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:90%
It's so efficient.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:84%
It's such a joy to work with
people and to teach people.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've been training
students since 2010,

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and they're having the
same kinds of outcomes.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.447 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:10:03.447 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we've spent
so many years bumbling

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:84%
around with things that
kind of work, you know.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And to have something--

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, this doesn't
work for all things.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But you know, our bodies are
really tonal expressions.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And our DNA is really
music, you know.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.996 align:middle line:90%
And I talk about this--

00:10:19.996 --> 00:10:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Music,
light and color.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All frequency based.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: All
frequency based.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:84%
This concept that I
call "energenetics,"

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.340 align:middle line:84%
which is the tone of
the song of our DNA.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And sound allows us
to rewrite the key

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:90%
that that music is written in.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, babies are
not clean slates.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:84%
They come preloaded with all
kinds of tonal programming.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I've seen many people, when
I'm reading their fields,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:84%
who've come in with depression,
who come in with anxiety,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And they try to
approach the treatment

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
from the level of me and
mine without realizing

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:84%
that the roots of that tonal
expression in their being

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.120 align:middle line:90%
might go back many generations.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I did an
interview with a woman

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:90%
named Ani Williams.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:10%
And she uses voice
toning, but also

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.122 align:middle line:10%
kind of voice recognition
spectrum that she

00:11:09.122 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:10%
puts people's voices through.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And other people
do this as well.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And then she
reflects back to you

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.650 align:middle line:84%
the missing tonal
range in your voice,

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:84%
which can tell a lot about your
personality, your expression,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
your propensity toward
particular, you know,

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:84%
imbalances in the
body and so forth.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And then in that
case, she simply

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.142 align:middle line:84%
has you use your own voice to
begin filling in that spectrum,

00:11:32.142 --> 00:11:32.942 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically what
we're doing with tuning forks.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the tuning fork is a
little purer, stronger, cleaner

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.537 align:middle line:84%
than our own voices, depending
on the quality of one's voice.

00:11:42.537 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yes.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
and the ability

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.690 align:middle line:84%
to really sustain a
particular note or kind of

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:90%
hit that note, so to speak.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.655 align:middle line:84%
But you know, this
brings me to--

00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
before we start going more
into the science of it--

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.110 align:middle line:84%
just the notion of
what happens when

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.200 align:middle line:84%
you have someone that is
bathed in a full range

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:84%
of sound frequencies
all the time,

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:05.404 align:middle line:84%
such as people that use their
voice for a living, singers.

00:12:05.404 --> 00:12:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Oh, well
you know, it's interesting.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:10%
The longest lived
profession is actually

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:10%
musical conductors, which I
think is really fantastic.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Because they're
bathed in coherent sound

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
article I read

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:84%
was speculating that it
was the arm flapping that

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.682 align:middle line:84%
was giving them a work out that
was making them live longer.

00:12:25.682 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But you know, you look at
people like Mick Jagger

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.252 align:middle line:84%
or I met Herbie Hancock
a few months ago

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle line:84%
when I was at the electric
universe conference.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:84%
He was playing in
Phoenix that same night.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I saw on
Wikipedia that he was 78.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:10%
And so right before I met him,
I was looking for an old man.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:10%
And he walked past me and
I didn't even recognize him

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.485 align:middle line:10%
because he looks 50.

00:12:50.485 --> 00:12:51.700 align:middle line:10%
He looks 50.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.832 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:52.832 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:10%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And so
we were fortunate enough

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:10%
to get tickets to the
show and backstage passes

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:10%
because he was really
interested in my work with sound

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.310 align:middle line:10%
and you know, what
we know about that.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was such a great show.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:90%
And he played for two hours.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.004 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end
they did an encore.

00:13:08.004 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And he's got this keytar,
it's a keyboard guitar.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:10%
And this guy, who's
78, was bouncing

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.160 align:middle line:10%
up and down on the
stage after playing

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.340 align:middle line:10%
for two hours like a teenager.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was astonished
at his vitality.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he plays
such wonderful music.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that you
look at these old rockers,

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.256 align:middle line:90%
you know, they just keep going.

00:13:28.256 --> 00:13:29.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's because music is--

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Against all
odds in some cases.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
Against all odds.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And even with all
the inputs they've

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:90%
had, drugs and cigarettes.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
that's what I mean.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.283 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: You know,
it counterbalances that.

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And music just brings energy
and aliveness to our bodies.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.526 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we tend
to be a culture now

00:13:44.526 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't put a high premium
on singing and dancing anymore.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: No,
we've really lost it.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, the
Western world in general.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, and you
know, I think it's central--

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even more
so in the East now too,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:84%
as they've become
more indoctrinated

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.000 align:middle line:84%
into the Western ways
of living and living

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.145 align:middle line:84%
by ticking off the clock
and the list and so forth.

00:14:00.145 --> 00:14:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Absolutely.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No
singing and dancing.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.005 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: No
singing and dancing.

00:14:04.005 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I think to be
human is to sing and dance.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very important
part of who we are,

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:84%
whether it's mantra,
whether it's song.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:10%
And they've done
plenty of studies

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:10%
that show that singing in groups
boosts all your immune markers.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.480 align:middle line:10%
I read this wonderful
story, I can't

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:10%
remember where it was,
about this monastery

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:10%
where the monks got together
and they chanted like all day.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And this new abbot
said oh no, we're

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.689 align:middle line:90%
not going to chant anymore.

00:14:27.689 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were all hanging
around like a limp dish rags,

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.280 align:middle line:84%
because running that
tone through their system

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:90%
tones their system.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It brings energy and aliveness
and flow and functionality.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:90%
And without that, you know.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And so people, you know, they
sit at desks, they don't sing.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:84%
People don't even like
their singing voice.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.666 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you ask a
room a kindergartners who

00:14:45.666 --> 00:14:48.442 align:middle line:84%
likes their singing voice,
they all raise their hand.

00:14:48.442 --> 00:14:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And then something
terrible happens

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:84%
along the way and
people stop singing

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and they stop believing
that they can sing.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And they just lose that
potential for aliveness.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they really do.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's start talking about
the more technical ends

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:84%
of the subject
for a bit and then

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:84%
we'll kind of get back
to mantras and so forth.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.410 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things you
see is in this kind of almost

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:84%
like tree rings moving
out from the body

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
of these waves of energy is
you're able to see the trauma.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how trauma
shows up in your work.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you say, we
come preloaded, for one.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Absolutely.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.281 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean, I
would say that it probably

00:15:27.281 --> 00:15:28.840 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
previous incarnations.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: As well.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As well.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:90%
And it has to do with in utero.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
ancestral programming.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:90%
It has to do with all that.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So we're not a clean slate,
as you said, from birth.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.922 align:middle line:84%
But then a lot
happens after that.

00:15:40.922 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
what trauma looks like,

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:84%
because that's a
lot of your work.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.886 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
It is, absolutely.

00:15:45.886 --> 00:15:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So we work with what I call
the biofield anatomy map.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is really based on
my own subjective observation

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:84%
of exploration of the
area around the body.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And the biofield anatomy
map, it took many years

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
to really come together and
form the sort of complete thing

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:90%
that you learn about in my book.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.240 align:middle line:84%
But essentially,
what I found, what I

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:84%
observed was that our memories,
rather than being stored

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.200 align:middle line:84%
in our brain, appear to be
stored in the field that

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:90%
surrounds our body.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, the diffuse
weak magnetic field

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that is bounded by this
double layer membrane.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And having this double membrane
creates standing waves,

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.550 align:middle line:84%
in the same way
that the ionosphere

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:84%
creates standing waves of the
Schumann resonance or radio

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.970 align:middle line:90%
waves, right.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
They bounce off of it and
create a standing wave.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And so when you pass an
activated tuning fork

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.890 align:middle line:84%
through this field,
the tones that

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:84%
are being emitted from the fork
intersect these invisible waves

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.550 align:middle line:90%
that are in the field.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.785 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear
the tone change.

00:16:53.785 --> 00:16:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that's
what I was going to ask.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's very obvious.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not some subtle thing that
only sensitive people perceive.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:84%
It's if I'm teaching a class
and we have a room of 20 people

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and we're working on something,
everybody can hear it.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:90%
It's very obvious.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.572 align:middle line:90%
And it's similar to music.

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we know
in music like if you

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:90%
hear a minor third--

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:17.278 align:middle line:84%
in music, that sort of
is indicative of sadness

00:17:17.278 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:84%
and you're like oh,
that sounds sad--

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
so when you hear these
changes in tone in the forks,

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
it's not intuition
that's telling you

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.089 align:middle line:84%
what it is, it's just your
own senses being like, oh,

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:90%
that sounds sad.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:26.875 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's information.

00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
It's information,

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and you're just responding to
it the same way you do music.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, when they want make
something scary in a movie,

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:84%
they put in this pulsing
quality kind of music, right.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Think "Jaws."

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And actually, when we
feel fear in our body,

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:90%
it produces a pulsing quality.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you get really
scared, that waveform

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
that has a pulsing quality
will make you shake, right.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when we find
areas in the field

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
where there is a record
of fear, the tuning fork

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:90%
will produce a pulsing quality.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:90%
That's very, very evident.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Or if we find something
that is alarm,

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.130 align:middle line:84%
like if somebody
was suddenly rear

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.370 align:middle line:84%
ended and their whole system
had an adrenaline rush

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and they had
experience of alarm,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:84%
you hear this very sharp kind of
high pitch sound that's there.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:15.255 align:middle line:84%
So as we move through the field,
you have these changing tones.

00:18:15.255 --> 00:18:16.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
kind of a dance

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:90%
between those frequencies.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But there's also areas where we
encounter a sense of resistance

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:90%
that's very odd.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you say resistance?

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So how does that, how
do you experience that?

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:25.483 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Well,
so you're moving along

00:18:25.483 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:90%
with the tuning fork, right.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden it feels
like you can't go any further,

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:90%
like you get stuck.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: You're
like, I'm stuck here.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.308 align:middle line:84%
Because you know,
obviously you can

00:18:33.308 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:90%
override that and go through.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
We're just working with
the waves in space.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in that
area, you know, just

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:84%
being sensitive and perceptive
to what you're encountering,

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:84%
then we find these things
that I call tangles

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
where the wave forms
that we produce--

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:90%
we're very chaotic.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.501 align:middle line:84%
You know, you just
found out your husband's

00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:53.239 align:middle line:84%
been having an affair and
he's drained the bank account.

00:18:53.239 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:84%
You're about to go through
your dark night of the soul.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're using
all the blood in your body.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.325 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:18:57.325 --> 00:18:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you start to feel
very chaotic feelings

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:90%
and resistance.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that gets laid
down in the album,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:84%
in the track, the
soundtrack of our life.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And so when we encounter
these, you know,

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.920 align:middle line:84%
let's say somebody is 60,
and that sort of thing

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.050 align:middle line:84%
happened when they were 30, on
the left side of their heart

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:84%
where sadness, grief,
and loss is stored,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
we're going to hit halfway
through their field.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So let me just explain that
the outer edge of the field

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:90%
is gestation.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Just inside that is birth.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you move along
like rings in a tree

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
up until the present time,
which is close to your body.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's very equidistant.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So you know, if somebody is 60
and you find a tangle halfway

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.821 align:middle line:84%
through, that's happened
when they were 30.

00:19:41.821 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the beautiful
thing about the sound

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:84%
is the tuning forks
will initially

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%
resonate with that distortion.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.970 align:middle line:84%
They'll be kind of stuck
with that resistance.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep on introducing
this pure tone into that spot,

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:84%
the body will sort of
spontaneously detangle itself.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It will organize those
patterns into a more

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:90%
coherent expression.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the energy
that has been

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:84%
trapped there, the photons or
the plasma, sort of decouples.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can take
that energy, and you

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:84%
can use the tuning
fork like a magnet,

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and you can bring it
back into the system.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Drop it in the midline
of body where it gets

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:90%
restored into flow.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're really doing
when we comb through the field

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and we find these areas
of chaos and stuckness,

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
is we're liberating
our potential.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the more trauma
somebody has had,

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.240 align:middle line:84%
the more their essential life
force is stuck in the past.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: This is a way
of going back to birth trauma,

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.250 align:middle line:84%
going back to precognitive
under the age of three,

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.420 align:middle line:84%
where you know, you can't
remember what happened.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But we've lost little bits
of ourselves, you know.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:84%
We've leaked light, we've
shed soul fragments, that's

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.115 align:middle line:90%
another way of looking at it.

00:20:51.115 --> 00:20:51.985 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:20:51.985 --> 00:20:53.776 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: We're
sort of defragmenting

00:20:53.776 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:84%
the hard drive that is
us by bringing harmony

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.160 align:middle line:84%
to these dissonant areas and
then bringing that energy back

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:90%
into flow.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I hear from
people all the time

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:84%
that they feel lighter,
that they have more energy.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.317 align:middle line:84%
And people always
report, I went home

00:21:08.317 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:90%
and I busted a bunch of clutter.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I, you know, cleaned
closets that I

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.226 align:middle line:90%
haven't been able to do before.

00:21:13.226 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like
the flow of energy

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.995 align:middle line:90%
was restored in their being.

00:21:15.995 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
Was restored, yeah.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Energy goes up.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.498 align:middle line:90%
Well, it makes perfect sense.

00:21:19.498 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed
other people

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.990 align:middle line:84%
who use the sense of
sight, for example,

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:84%
to be able to look at a
person's aura and the colors

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and the distortions
and so forth.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And so from your
point of view, you

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.485 align:middle line:84%
can hear what a person's
life sounds like.

00:21:35.485 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's so amazing about it
and one of my favorite things

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:84%
about this work is
that once we get

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:84%
the distortion and the
noise out of the signal,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:90%
the true signal emerges.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's just so beautiful.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.756 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I first
started doing this work

00:21:49.756 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and I started discovering this
underlying harmony in everyone,

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.700 align:middle line:84%
this underlying beauty, I had
a lot of cognitive dissonance

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't understand why I was
having a hard time with what

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:90%
my senses were showing me.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
My senses were showing me
beauty, harmony, greatness,

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:90%
order, you know, magnificence.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.107 align:middle line:84%
And I really had to struggle
and puzzle over that, you know.

00:22:13.107 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Why am I having a
hard time with this?

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
that even though I

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:84%
have been raised in a
non-religious home, that I

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.160 align:middle line:84%
still had been really programmed
with the idea of original sin

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and guilt. And that we're
like guilty sinners,

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:90%
we've fallen from grace.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That then made you
feel less than on every level.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.358 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Less
than on every level.

00:22:29.358 --> 00:22:32.384 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, to discover
that that wasn't true

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:84%
at all, that we're like
actually magnificent beings,

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.650 align:middle line:84%
you know, I kept coming home
to my husband and being like,

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.420 align:middle line:84%
that person I worked
on today was great.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.205 align:middle line:84%
Because when that true tone
emerges, it's just beauty.

00:22:41.205 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, what,
is everyone great?

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was like yeah, I
think everyone's great.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
We're just kind of
buried under noise

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and you know, ancestral
burdens and lies, and you know,

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:90%
so many things.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
But so you know, yes, we're
getting into the trauma,

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:90%
we're healing that.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.753 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes that
can be uncomfortable

00:22:57.753 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:90%
and people can have detox.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.120 align:middle line:84%
But what emerges is
so worth it, you know.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:90%
It's that underlying.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you know people, I
always reflect back to people

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:90%
when I hear a beautiful tone.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:10%
You know, like this is you.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:10%
Listen to how
amazing you sounds.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Listen to how beautiful you are.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:90%
And people go yeah, I knew that.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.444 align:middle line:84%
You know, I hear
that and I know that,

00:23:18.444 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't been able
to let myself feel it,

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
because I've been so
programmed to feel unworthy.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the big one for humanity.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Big one.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're passing
the tuning fork through,

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.440 align:middle line:84%
is it fair to say that where
there are kind of distortions

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.270 align:middle line:84%
or incoherence in
the field, does it

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:84%
sound a little more
like minor keys?

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.622 align:middle line:84%
Or is that too
blunt a statement.

00:23:42.622 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, I
think it's hard to say,

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.788 align:middle line:84%
because it's so different,
and everybody's different.

00:23:46.788 --> 00:23:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can really hear all
kinds of sounds, you know.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the Western musical
scale is too limited, really,

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:90%
to compare it to--

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.991 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I wonder.

00:23:54.991 --> 00:23:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: --to the
symphony of the body.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But I really do
see the correlation

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
between things that
happen in people's

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.549 align:middle line:84%
past and the way their body
starts to break down over time.

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm thinking
of a gentleman

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:84%
that I worked on
who was in his 70s.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And he had a really bad
pain in his left hip.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And what we
discovered was that he

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:84%
had had an injury
when he was around 20

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:90%
that was pretty severe.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And so when we went
and untangled his field

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and released the tension
and kind of restored order

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.380 align:middle line:84%
into that area, all
his hip pain went away.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.762 align:middle line:84%
But it was from that
incident, you know.

00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And I find that all the time.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, my
shoulder is going out.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.161 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had a sledding
accident when I was seven.

00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Or my neck always goes out.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, it's these
imbalances in the field.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Because magnetic fields,
magnetic currents

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:90%
guide electric currents.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.570 align:middle line:10%
So our magnetic field is
informing our physical body

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:51.644 align:middle line:10%
all the time.

00:24:51.644 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:10%
You know, you go
to a chiropractor

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:10%
because your bones
are out of whack

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:10%
and they'll put them back.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.647 align:middle line:84%
But then, you know,
you go back out again.

00:24:57.647 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, your bones
or electric, your bones

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:84%
are piezoelectric, they're
carrying an electric current.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.264 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, if you've got
a really strong tangle over here

00:25:05.264 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:84%
in your magnetic
field, it's going

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:90%
to keep pulling your neck out.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.340 align:middle line:84%
But once you adjust
the magnetic field

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and you bring it into order,
then the electric system,

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.146 align:middle line:84%
the body will just
stay in order.

00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.311 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm just kind
of flashing back when you

00:25:18.311 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:90%
said this man's hip pain that--

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and I don't quite
understand this--

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I have kind of a
strange wiring anyway

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:90%
in that I don't create cortisol.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a strange birth defect.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But the way it's
come out is that it

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:84%
seems that the trauma doesn't
hold like it does usually.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Because I've damaged both hips.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Not broken them,
but smashed them

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.980 align:middle line:84%
so badly that the black and
blue bruises lasted for months.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Wow.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Never got any therapy,
never did anything like that.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Never had any pain
afterward, nothing.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
You're really lucky.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On both sides.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.145 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: That's amazing.

00:25:54.145 --> 00:25:56.228 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this happens
because I don't live in

00:25:56.228 --> 00:25:57.190 align:middle line:90%
my body that closely.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I'll tend to bump
around through life,

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.704 align:middle line:84%
but I never-- it doesn't seem
to hold any physical pain.

00:26:02.704 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So what could be happening
with something like that?

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.351 align:middle line:84%
I know it's more of an
oddity, but just to look at it

00:26:07.351 --> 00:26:08.350 align:middle line:90%
in reverse or something.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it might have something
to do with the stickiness

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.560 align:middle line:90%
of your magnetic field.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.080 align:middle line:84%
You might have more fluidity
because your stress response

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%
is not mitigated by cortisol.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm asking.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going to get
into the adrenal question

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.831 align:middle line:84%
in a moment, so I thought
it was good to bring up

00:26:23.831 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the minus
or negative situation.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Which your body has to run
totally differently if it

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.920 align:middle line:90%
doesn't create cortisol.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.720 align:middle line:90%
It's dangerous.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:90%
It has its downside.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.995 align:middle line:90%
But it has its upsides.

00:26:35.995 --> 00:26:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, I'd say.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:38.844 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because my
husband's always saying,

00:26:38.844 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:84%
you bumped into this thing,
there's no lasting pain.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
that seems to stick.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's not usual.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: No.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's look
at what usually happens

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:84%
with a cortisol response,
an adrenaline response,

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening
with our adrenal glands

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and their interaction
within this field.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.406 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people
have fried adrenals now.

00:27:01.406 --> 00:27:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Absolutely.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.889 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's see what
it normally does in a body.

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Well
you know, that's

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:84%
a really good topic as
far as this work goes,

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:11.080 align:middle line:84%
the biofield tuning,
because we work

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.310 align:middle line:90%
a lot with people's adrenals.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:15.040 align:middle line:90%
And I've had to have mine fixed.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.044 align:middle line:84%
I've gone through burnout in
various stages in my life.

00:27:18.044 --> 00:27:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I owned a restaurant
when I was in my 20s that

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.202 align:middle line:90%
got insanely busy.

00:27:21.202 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:84%
I was working 100 hour weeks
on my feet all the time.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was it?

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Where were you?

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: It
was in Connecticut,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.190 align:middle line:84%
a town called
Pomfret, Connecticut.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.990 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.590 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Vanilla Bean Cafe.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.580 align:middle line:84%
I started it when I
was 20 with my family.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:84%
We started with 16 seats and
my mom and two of my brothers.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And within 3 and 1/2 years
we had 90 seats inside,

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.066 align:middle line:84%
50 seats outside, doubled
the size of the kitchen,

00:27:39.066 --> 00:27:40.565 align:middle line:84%
tripled the size
of the dining room.

00:27:40.565 --> 00:27:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's stress.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.202 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: 32 employees.

00:27:42.202 --> 00:27:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And I had been working
seven days a week.

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:44.710 align:middle line:90%
It was just nuts.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.215 align:middle line:90%
And I really burned out hard.

00:27:47.215 --> 00:27:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what actually
brought me to sound.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.232 align:middle line:84%
Because I took a
leave of absence

00:27:51.232 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and went to massage
therapy school.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Because my back was ruined,
my adrenals were ruined,

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.590 align:middle line:90%
I had TMJ.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I had all these
digestive issues.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.970 align:middle line:90%
It was just-- I was a mess.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been interested in
natural health and wellness

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So I went and got my massage
therapy certification.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And then started playing with
the tuning forks in my massage

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.270 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, you know,
just as a hobby.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:84%
But it was my own drive
towards recovery, you know,

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.350 align:middle line:84%
that has brought me down
this road, my own quest

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
for understanding
not just health,

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.280 align:middle line:84%
but also human
potential, you know.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: So but what
happens when we work 100 hour

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:84%
weeks, when we're constantly
discharging and not recharging,

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is that our adrenal
rhythm becomes

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.500 align:middle line:90%
very high and very fast.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we're just
running on adrenaline.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's sucking energy
out of our kidneys

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:46.180 align:middle line:90%
and out of our bones.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if you
go to a naturopath,

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:84%
they're going to push a
lot of bottles of things

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.390 align:middle line:90%
across the counter at you.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.432 align:middle line:84%
You know, Ashwagandha,
this, that, and the other.

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:55.231 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: If you go see
a biofield tuning practitioner,

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:84%
what we will do is we will lock
phase with your adrenal rhythm

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
at the outer edge of
your adrenal field, which

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:90%
extends past your fingertips.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a minor
plasma membrane there,

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:84%
because the adrenals
throw a pretty big field.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Once we hit that
information zone,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.720 align:middle line:90%
we just focus on the adrenals.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:10%
And we move in slowly,
letting the adrenal

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.282 align:middle line:10%
listen to and hear itself.

00:29:22.282 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:10%
And then we get
right over the body

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:10%
and we just hang out with it.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that that
rhythm starts to ratchet down.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to come into
a more factory settings

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.350 align:middle line:90%
kind of expression.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And once your rhythm
is running properly,

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:84%
then you don't need all of
those pills and supplements

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.140 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Will the
adrenal glands then

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.756 align:middle line:84%
re-establish themselves
to a healthy output?

00:29:47.756 --> 00:29:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Absolutely.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.684 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:49.684 --> 00:29:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of
the first people

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.890 align:middle line:84%
that I was developing
this work with.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And when I was evaluating
his rhythms, you know,

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.740 align:middle line:90%
his left side sounded so awful.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I was like, usually the right
sounds worse than the left,

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.290 align:middle line:84%
because they seem to respond
to different stressors.

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:84%
The right one is
more social stress

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and the left one is
more my organism is

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.477 align:middle line:90%
under threat kind of stress.

00:30:13.477 --> 00:30:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, in our
culture, most people

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:84%
it's office politics, it's
family stress, it's money

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:90%
stress, it's more right adrenal.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Left adrenal is more
like battle zones

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and you know, physical abuse
and that sort of thing.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.632 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like wow, if you're
left adrenal sounds this bad,

00:30:29.632 --> 00:30:32.090 align:middle line:84%
I can't even imagine what you're
right adrenal sounds like.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.756 align:middle line:84%
And I came around and I listened
to it, and there was no signal.

00:30:34.756 --> 00:30:36.680 align:middle line:84%
It was like, it
felt like pudding.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.689 align:middle line:84%
It had just gone
completely offline.

00:30:38.689 --> 00:30:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And I was able to resurrect it.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I was able to give it CPR with
sound and get it back online.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
person, he was almost dead.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had so much
stress in his life

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and was really at
the end of his rope.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And after five or six sessions,
he completely changed.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.990 align:middle line:84%
He sold his business,
he sold his house.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:84%
He created a
lifestyle for himself

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.620 align:middle line:84%
that was life supporting
instead of life sapping.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:84%
But he also had generations
of that pattern in his field.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:84%
His father was a Native
American alcoholic

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.352 align:middle line:84%
who'd been in the
military, who beat him.

00:31:11.352 --> 00:31:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And his father had been
the same and his father

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.850 align:middle line:90%
had been the same.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at
multiple generations

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.230 align:middle line:84%
of just these shattered
fields and completely

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:19.230 align:middle line:90%
stressed out adrenals.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: You know, never
mind the morphic field of what

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.400 align:middle line:84%
all the Native Americans
had been through,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.059 align:middle line:90%
which also informs people.

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look at
it now from the glands

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:90%
don't operate solo either.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the other master
glands working with them.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:10%
We have the pituitary,
for example,

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:10%
a kind of a magical,
master gland that is also

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:10%
responsible for overseeing
some of the function

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.675 align:middle line:10%
of the adrenals, right.

00:31:44.675 --> 00:31:44.975 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Absolutely.

00:31:44.975 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
do the tuning forks

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.349 align:middle line:84%
work with these
amazing master glands?

00:31:49.349 --> 00:31:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Well, the
same with the thyroid, right.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.991 align:middle line:84%
That's a big part of
people's issues today.

00:31:53.991 --> 00:31:55.990 align:middle line:10%
You know, we do a lot of
work in biofield tuning

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.650 align:middle line:10%
with the thyroid.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:57.472 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would guess.

00:31:57.472 --> 00:31:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
And so much of that

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.820 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
speaking our truth.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and we're
going to get to that too, yeah.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And so, you
know, every system in your body

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:90%
has its right rhythm.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're really just a
collection of instrumentalists,

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:11.570 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:90%
You're an inner orchestra.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's got
the right sheet music

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and is playing in
time, you know,

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.420 align:middle line:84%
or things are kind
of a chaotic mess.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So basically we're
either making music

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.580 align:middle line:84%
or we're making noise, you
know, in our own inner symphony.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's really just a
matter of everything having

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.620 align:middle line:90%
its right rhythm and flow.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Well so, you were going to
get to that a moment ago,

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
notion of expression.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So in the thyroid, you're also
talking about the fifth chakra,

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:84%
the chakra having to
do with expression

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.640 align:middle line:90%
and verbalizing our truth.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to hold
back our truth.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at how the
emotions and behavior are

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.676 align:middle line:90%
feeding in with these systems.

00:32:49.676 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah,
it's really huge.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:10%
I say that the throat chakra
is probably the most important

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.160 align:middle line:10%
chakra that I work on.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.420 align:middle line:10%
Because it's by our word
that we create our life.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not
speaking our truth,

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.420 align:middle line:84%
we're creating a life that isn't
in alignment with who we are.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.314 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:07.314 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And so
I think in our culture,

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, we've been told
to not speak our truth,

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.300 align:middle line:90%
to not express our emotions.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, what
I've seen, for example,

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:84%
in people who have
chronic fatigue,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.950 align:middle line:84%
this is just a pattern
that I've observed,

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.810 align:middle line:84%
is that they have a
big build up of energy

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:25.700 align:middle line:84%
on the left side
of their throat.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.094 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
advocate for themselves,

00:33:28.094 --> 00:33:29.510 align:middle line:84%
they don't speak
their truth, they

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:90%
don't express their emotions.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, they tend to say
what other people want to hear.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Or when they do try to express
themselves, they're not heard.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.657 align:middle line:84%
You know, they have
a belief that nobody

00:33:39.657 --> 00:33:41.240 align:middle line:84%
cares what I have
to say or it doesn't

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:90%
matter if I express my needs.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or perhaps they don't
ask for help when they need it.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.491 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Or they
don't ask for help.

00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:47.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, women especially
have been really conditioned

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.380 align:middle line:90%
to put everybody ahead of them.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And if you
take that advice hook, line,

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and sinker, you're going
to get chronic fatigue.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.930 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
get fibromyalgia.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
Epstein-Barr, you know.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.321 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:59.321 --> 00:34:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And getting to
a place where we are actually

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.810 align:middle line:84%
able to speak truth, you
know, this is my truth.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.440 align:middle line:84%
If we're upset about something
to express it without charge.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.830 align:middle line:84%
To approach any kind of issue
that it's not confrontation

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:14.630 align:middle line:90%
that we can--

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:19.219 align:middle line:84%
I believe in win-win, that I
can use respect and kindness

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:23.659 align:middle line:84%
and diplomacy to communicate
to you how I feel

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:24.800 align:middle line:90%
and what my truth is.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And we can have a
win-win encounter.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.739 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people do
what I call stuff and blow.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:32.719 align:middle line:84%
Where they suppress and
they suppress and they

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:34.980 align:middle line:84%
suppress till they
can't hold it anymore.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.389 align:middle line:84%
And then they overreact
to a particular situation

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.699 align:middle line:84%
where they discharge a
whole lot on somebody

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:43.210 align:middle line:84%
inappropriately and
get push back from it.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they go oh, I
don't like confrontation.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they go back
into stuffing and blowing.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.639 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile,
their whole center

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:52.429 align:middle line:84%
of their throat chakra
and their thyroid

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:54.139 align:middle line:90%
is not being stimulated.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:57.157 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
coming through from here.

00:34:57.157 --> 00:34:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do you think
that the almost epidemic

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.520 align:middle line:84%
levels of thyroid
problems now have

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.620 align:middle line:84%
as much to do with
our own inability

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.865 align:middle line:84%
to express than anything,
quote, chemical?

00:35:05.865 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: I do.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.380 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.180 align:middle line:90%
I think that--

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very hard to
commit to speaking truth.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that again,
that self-worth issue

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.960 align:middle line:90%
gets in the way of that.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to
know how to express

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.490 align:middle line:90%
our emotions appropriately.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.640 align:middle line:84%
We're not given models
of appropriate emotional

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:90%
management.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, men are
allowed to get angry.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Women are allowed to get
sad, and that's really it.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And so you
know, when a woman gets angry,

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:36.420 align:middle line:84%
men try to shut
her down, you know.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Instead of what my
husband has learned

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.020 align:middle line:84%
to do over the years is whenever
I have an emotional experience,

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.190 align:middle line:90%
he will listen to it.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.272 align:middle line:90%
He will validate it.

00:35:45.272 --> 00:35:46.230 align:middle line:90%
He won't try to fix me.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.209 align:middle line:90%
He won't shut down.

00:35:47.209 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And he'll allow me
to work through it

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.604 align:middle line:90%
and we digest it together.

00:35:50.604 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's a functional
way of approaching emotions.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Took a long time to learn it.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.634 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we have very
dysfunctional approaches

00:35:58.634 --> 00:35:59.675 align:middle line:90%
to managing our emotions.

00:35:59.675 --> 00:36:01.841 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not only that,
take the reverse of it,

00:36:01.841 --> 00:36:03.600 align:middle line:84%
men becoming sad and
women freaking out

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.080 align:middle line:90%
because the guy is losing it.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's losing
his stuff, you know.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And that whatever strength
she thought he had she thinks

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:90%
is dissipating.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And so women are as guilty as
men in terms of this projection

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.510 align:middle line:90%
onto the other, oftentimes.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that's interesting
about the thyroid.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because most people
I know after they hit 45

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:84%
or so, it's like
women in particular,

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.300 align:middle line:84%
seem to have all
these thyroid issues.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:84%
But again, as you
said, it's often

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.925 align:middle line:84%
women who are stuffing
that truth down.

00:36:31.925 --> 00:36:32.925 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:36:32.925 --> 00:36:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're resisting everything
about who they are, you know,

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.300 align:middle line:84%
their own natural inclinations,
their own desires.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.760 align:middle line:84%
We've become very
programmed into we

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.440 align:middle line:84%
have to make
everyone else happy,

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, we have to
do the right thing,

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.780 align:middle line:90%
we have to do what we're told.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
getting to a place where

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.201 align:middle line:84%
you do what you feel like and
you speak your truth, you know,

00:36:51.201 --> 00:36:52.620 align:middle line:84%
you've got to be
kind of a rebel--

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: --to like that.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To really take
one some sovereignty there.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.845 align:middle line:84%
And that's breaking
many generations.

00:36:59.845 --> 00:37:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.863 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Many, many
generations of patterns

00:37:01.863 --> 00:37:02.970 align:middle line:90%
that we've inherited.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.095 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Absolutely.

00:37:04.095 --> 00:37:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And those inform us so
much more than we realize.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.530 align:middle line:90%
They really do, you know.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:09.514 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: We
look at dog breeding

00:37:09.514 --> 00:37:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and we can see temperament and
body types and all that, but we

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.609 align:middle line:84%
don't necessarily recognize that
we're the same way, you know,

00:37:15.609 --> 00:37:17.400 align:middle line:84%
that we're bred with
a certain temperament,

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.960 align:middle line:90%
with a certain body type.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.870 align:middle line:84%
That the genetic structure
and those temperaments

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:22.987 align:middle line:90%
get passed along.

00:37:22.987 --> 00:37:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So have
you seen once people

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.944 align:middle line:84%
have gone through this tuning
process people with thyroid

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:30.210 align:middle line:84%
problems, for example, and who
have taken it upon themselves

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.490 align:middle line:84%
to start expressing
themselves, does the thyroid

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:33.990 align:middle line:84%
start straightening
itself back out?

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.365 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
It does, it does.

00:37:35.365 --> 00:37:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I've seen people
have to cut back thyroid meds.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people go
off thyroid meds.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.702 align:middle line:84%
Well, since we're on
the subject of chakras,

00:37:43.702 --> 00:37:45.160 align:middle line:84%
why not go through
a couple others.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.625 align:middle line:84%
What about heart disease, broken
heartedness, heavy heartedness?

00:37:48.625 --> 00:37:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that's all
tonal as well, you know.

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.260 align:middle line:84%
For example, when
people have depression,

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:84%
when you get into this
left side of the heart,

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.380 align:middle line:84%
the tuning fork will emit
an undertone kind of whoa.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Makes me think of Eeyore, gray.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:05.291 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:05.291 --> 00:38:06.831 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And
it will be almost

00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:08.580 align:middle line:84%
like there's a low
pressure system

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:84%
of undigested, unexpressed
energy just sitting

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:84%
there, kind of wet,
heavy quality that has

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.114 align:middle line:90%
this particular tonal quality.

00:38:18.114 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
with the tuning,

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.330 align:middle line:90%
we hang out where that tone is.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:25.650 align:middle line:84%
The body recognizes it, kind of
lifts itself up, brings itself

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.510 align:middle line:90%
into a more harmony.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
center that energy,

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.800 align:middle line:84%
then it starts to
flow the way that it's

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.522 align:middle line:84%
meant, to which is
to actually have

00:38:33.522 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
open heartedness,

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.430 align:middle line:84%
being able to really love,
even if it's a sunset or a dog,

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:39.573 align:middle line:90%
you know, those are easy.

00:38:39.573 --> 00:38:40.572 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just to feel--

00:38:40.572 --> 00:38:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Just to feel.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that
expression again.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:43.344 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:38:43.344 --> 00:38:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I remember working on somebody
when I came to his heart,

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.379 align:middle line:84%
and I just felt like
his heart was hard.

00:38:48.379 --> 00:38:50.045 align:middle line:84%
Like you know, there
was this stiffness.

00:38:50.045 --> 00:38:52.050 align:middle line:84%
You heart is supposed
to be squishy, you know,

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.460 align:middle line:90%
and it was like--

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.770 align:middle line:90%
and he had hardened arteries.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.170 align:middle line:84%
But what I found was there
was a very specific place

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.770 align:middle line:84%
in his timeline where that
started, where he got divorced

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and he became estranged
from his children

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
relationships went south.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when we got
in there and we

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.300 align:middle line:84%
started changing that
tonal expression,

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and softening it, and pulling
out those strong tones,

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.530 align:middle line:90%
his heart started to act better.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up healing those
relationships, which was

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.531 align:middle line:90%
such a beautiful thing to see.

00:39:21.531 --> 00:39:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that is.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.630 align:middle line:90%
That's really a lovely story.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's go, let's continue on
down through the chakras then.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:28.384 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Sure.

00:39:28.384 --> 00:39:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So your solar plexus is this
is our power center, our will

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.220 align:middle line:84%
center, you know, where we
set goals and achieve them

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.450 align:middle line:90%
or where we get to yes.

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Kind of how we interact
with the world.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.910 align:middle line:84%
If people are-- for
example, I had a client

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:46.620 align:middle line:84%
who was an Iron Man triathlete
and a CEO of a large company.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And he had very strong
solar plexus energy.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's
very, very driven.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.290 align:middle line:84%
I worked with somebody
who had chronic heartburn.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And she had a mate who is
always imposing his will on her.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:84%
He was always doing
this energetically

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to her, which was then sending
this sort of reflux up.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And so when we strengthen
this particular area,

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.450 align:middle line:90%
it's strengthens our will.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And she started to
notice that every time he

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.770 align:middle line:90%
did that, she'd have reflux.

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And so she started to learn
how to push back, right.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Our parents' energy also really
informs the solar plexus.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I've discovered these
fixed plasma structures

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.085 align:middle line:90%
in the field that are like this.

00:40:32.085 --> 00:40:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And this one holds
the energy of mother

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:35.552 align:middle line:84%
and this one holds
the energy of father.

00:40:35.552 --> 00:40:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So I can stick a
fork in that zone,

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you all about the
character of your mother.

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I read that
in the book, the temperament

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.010 align:middle line:90%
of your parents.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, exactly,
their vibrational profile.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And
so sometimes I'll

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:47.120 align:middle line:84%
be coming in, I'll
get stuck on mom.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.786 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have to work
on mom for a while

00:40:48.786 --> 00:40:51.530 align:middle line:84%
before I can come and
work with my client.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we
hear things that

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.124 align:middle line:90%
happen that the parents change.

00:40:55.124 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
That the work actually goes
upstream and downstream.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Because DNA is an
unbroken resonant chain,

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:03.050 align:middle line:84%
you know, from the beginning
of life, really, you know.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
sort of operates

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.840 align:middle line:90%
in this resonance sort of way.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So when we switch the tone of
it in this particular zone,

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:13.924 align:middle line:84%
it's going to resonantly go
upstream and also downstream.

00:41:13.924 --> 00:41:14.840 align:middle line:90%
It's just fascinating.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.344 align:middle line:84%
Let's continue downstream
in the chakras, OK.

00:41:18.344 --> 00:41:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
So but I just want

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.135 align:middle line:84%
to say one more
thing about this.

00:41:21.135 --> 00:41:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Is that if we have a
lot of energy that's

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.994 align:middle line:84%
tied up in our parents, if dad
is an alcoholic or mom is crazy

00:41:25.994 --> 00:41:28.160 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that was, you
know, and we didn't really

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.100 align:middle line:84%
get the support that
we needed from them,

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.830 align:middle line:84%
you can end up with what
I call 80% syndrome.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Where you just don't
have the gumption

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.610 align:middle line:84%
to follow through and
complete tasks, right.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.210 align:middle line:90%
We all know people who have--

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.501 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many friends who
are carpenters and there's

00:41:44.501 --> 00:41:45.800 align:middle line:90%
no trim on the windows.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, people who have
motorcycle projects in a garage

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.300 align:middle line:90%
that they never finished.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, for me, it showed
up with I'd wash the laundry,

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.890 align:middle line:84%
dry the laundry,
fold the laundry,

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:57.070 align:middle line:84%
leave it on top of the
bureau and not put away.

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and not
put it in the drawers.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: You
know, that sort of thing.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.125 align:middle line:84%
It's like or not close
cupboard doors all the way.

00:42:01.125 --> 00:42:02.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So classic
procrastination?

00:42:02.695 --> 00:42:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: It's
just-- it's a lack of flow

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.326 align:middle line:90%
through the solar plexus.

00:42:06.326 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lack
of will, really.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:08.954 align:middle line:90%
It breaks our own will.

00:42:08.954 --> 00:42:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Because it's
stuck in our field, you know.

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:13.419 align:middle line:84%
If you had so much tension
because your father is

00:42:13.419 --> 00:42:15.710 align:middle line:84%
an alcoholic and he was always
raging through the house

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and you're holding your
breath or cringing,

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.137 align:middle line:84%
you know, you got
all this life force

00:42:21.137 --> 00:42:22.970 align:middle line:84%
that's stuck in your
field on the right side

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.140 align:middle line:90%
of your solar plexus.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not flowing
through your center.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: You know, you
just don't have the energy

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's not your fault.
It's just not there.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.400 align:middle line:90%
But we can fix it.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can tune it.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:35.925 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:42:35.925 --> 00:42:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I always put the laundry
in the drawer now.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:45.800 align:middle line:84%
The second chakra has to do
with sexuality, with creativity,

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.750 align:middle line:90%
with self-worth.

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this
is the chakra that's

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.790 align:middle line:90%
the messiest on everybody.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
doing this work,

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I found that people's energy was
just spread like peanut butter

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:01.400 align:middle line:84%
across this part of the field
instead of being focused.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And in my classes,
you know, I ask

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.250 align:middle line:84%
my students, who feels
comfortable receiving pleasure,

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.700 align:middle line:84%
receiving money,
receiving personal power?

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.442 align:middle line:84%
And you know, what percentage of
hands do you think I see go up?

00:43:14.442 --> 00:43:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A small percentage.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:17.316 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: It's
a small percentage.

00:43:17.316 --> 00:43:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Men are more better
at it than women.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.490 align:middle line:84%
But most women don't
feel comfortable

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:26.900 align:middle line:84%
receiving or expressing
personal power, you know.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the health
of our second chakra

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:32.720 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with do we
allow ourselves pleasure,

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.820 align:middle line:84%
do we allow
ourselves creativity.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, do we feel good
about providing services

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:42.370 align:middle line:84%
to the world that enable us
to have sufficient cash flow,

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.370 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:45.525 align:middle line:84%
What is our overall
self-worth like?

00:43:45.525 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And most people's
energy is tied up

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:51.390 align:middle line:84%
in what I find on the right
side is guilt and shame,

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:52.279 align:middle line:90%
so much, so much.

00:43:52.279 --> 00:43:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it makes sense.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.420 align:middle line:84%
That goes back to the very
beginning of this conversation.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a chronic condition
of being human.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And every system reinforces
our unworthiness.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: It does.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.534 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a lie.

00:44:02.534 --> 00:44:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is a lie.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: It's such
a huge lie, you know.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Really at the kernel of
almost every dysfunction

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I've encountered on anybody,
it's some kind of story

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.610 align:middle line:90%
around not being good enough.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:14.068 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're good enough,
you go into a state of flow,

00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:14.900 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I am that, you know.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Everything is the
universe, it's all the one.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And I am that and
I'm mostly space.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And so if I'm in a
harmonic relationship

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.457 align:middle line:84%
with my environment,
everything in me flows.

00:44:25.457 --> 00:44:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But if I believe I'm
not worthy in some way,

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.956 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw
up resistance and I'm

00:44:28.956 --> 00:44:30.440 align:middle line:90%
going to block that flow.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's that arresting of
flow that creates disease.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So then on the other
side of the second chakra

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.010 align:middle line:84%
we find frustration
and disappointment.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And you know, most
people are chronically

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.565 align:middle line:84%
frustrated about
whatever, you know.

00:44:43.565 --> 00:44:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And disappointed.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And
disappointed over unmet needs,

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:47.908 align:middle line:90%
you know, that sort of thing.

00:44:47.908 --> 00:44:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I found that this very
interesting pattern

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.840 align:middle line:84%
in baby boomers who were bottle
fed on a schedule instead

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.640 align:middle line:90%
of breastfed on demand.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's
tremendous distortion

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:01.580 align:middle line:84%
in the second chakra because
of intense frustration

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.410 align:middle line:84%
over unmet needs,
you know, babies

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.530 align:middle line:84%
that are left to cry it
out between feedings.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.373 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dr. Spock's
theories, yeah.

00:45:08.373 --> 00:45:09.248 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:45:09.248 --> 00:45:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And don't get that
skin to skin contact

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and don't get the
nutrition of breast milk.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.900 align:middle line:10%
And so what I see, you
know, in baby boomers,

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.950 align:middle line:10%
is chronic frustration over
unmet needs, many digestive

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:24.130 align:middle line:10%
issues, the inability
to really connect

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:26.415 align:middle line:10%
and bond well with
others, you know,

00:45:26.415 --> 00:45:31.870 align:middle line:10%
and feeling a sense of satiety,
of satisfaction, of intimacy.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:34.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a lot of--
and it all goes from birth.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And sugar addiction
or wine addiction

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:37.886 align:middle line:90%
because they were fed.

00:45:37.886 --> 00:45:39.511 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
makes total sense.

00:45:39.511 --> 00:45:42.880 align:middle line:84%
That was the age where
convenience became the mantra.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.750 align:middle line:84%
TV dinners and like I said, Dr.
Spock and his views on raising

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.242 align:middle line:90%
children was very sterile.

00:45:48.242 --> 00:45:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Very sterile.

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
now you're seeing--

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:52.900 align:middle line:84%
where before that
there wasn't that.

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.720 align:middle line:84%
It was the extended family,
and you had your breast milk,

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.190 align:middle line:84%
and you know,
grandpa and grandma

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.232 align:middle line:90%
were probably around too.

00:45:58.232 --> 00:45:59.106 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:45:59.106 --> 00:46:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then now
where the younger mothers

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.490 align:middle line:84%
are understanding the
absolute necessity

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.910 align:middle line:90%
of that kind of bonding.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.134 align:middle line:90%
But that whole generation--

00:46:06.134 --> 00:46:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: They didn't.

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --was really
shoved aside, in that sense.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
PTSD after World War II.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the
40s and the 50s,

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.530 align:middle line:84%
everyone was
drinking and smoking

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.736 align:middle line:84%
and really sort of emotionally
and energetically disconnected.

00:46:17.736 --> 00:46:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
this, because you have boomers

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.480 align:middle line:84%
watching this show
that are saying wow,

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard
it put that way.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: I'll tell you--

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they know
that among their friends

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and their sisters and their
brothers, it's the same.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So before we move on to
a couple of other topics,

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:37.990 align:middle line:84%
what would you say are some
of the best self-healing ways

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to introduce tone or sound
into their lives, our lives,

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:46.030 align:middle line:84%
as boomers, you know, to start
correcting these frequencies?

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.287 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone can find someone
who tunes for a living.

00:46:48.287 --> 00:46:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Well, you
know, all of our practitioners

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.000 align:middle line:84%
are trained to do
work at a distance.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So even if you don't
live near anybody,

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:58.510 align:middle line:84%
you can find a practitioner
who can do work at a distance.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've created a
number of recordings

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.600 align:middle line:84%
as well that people
can listen to.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.773 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: But
I think, you know,

00:47:04.773 --> 00:47:07.360 align:middle line:84%
what I've come to see in
observing this pattern is

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.730 align:middle line:84%
it's really easy to see
why the baby boomers drove

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:11.049 align:middle line:90%
the self-help movement.

00:47:11.049 --> 00:47:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they needed it.

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.509 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And how
the question is wrong.

00:47:14.509 --> 00:47:16.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not about what's
wrong with you.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
not bad or wrong.

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:19.000 align:middle line:90%
You had a horrible birth.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Your mom was knocked out.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:23.080 align:middle line:84%
You were pulled out
with forceps, likely,

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.790 align:middle line:90%
after being heavily drugged.

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, you were
poked with vaccines.

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:30.949 align:middle line:90%
You were fed muck from a bottle.

00:47:30.949 --> 00:47:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From a young
age, very early age.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And introduced
into a very sterile,

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.080 align:middle line:84%
emotionally barren
kind of environment.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.460 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Your inputs were not good.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.794 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I think people are
really relieved to hear that.

00:47:46.794 --> 00:47:47.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:47:47.835 --> 00:47:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: They're
like, oh, it's not my fault.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:49.660 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm not bad.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.993 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go kind of
down the standard self-help

00:47:51.993 --> 00:47:54.320 align:middle line:84%
stuff about change your
thinking, change your life,

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:57.510 align:middle line:84%
it's insufficient to really
deprogram that early stuff.

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:47:58.310 --> 00:47:59.768 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
You know, age three

00:47:59.768 --> 00:48:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and under, the birth
trauma, those early inputs,

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.950 align:middle line:84%
those early beliefs
that your formed.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Crying it out.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Crying it out.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:06.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I see
this all the time.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:09.490 align:middle line:84%
The right side of the throat
has to do with speaking and not

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:10.450 align:middle line:90%
being heard.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And those babies that
were left to cry it out

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:16.960 align:middle line:84%
formed beliefs that what they
had to say wasn't important

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.270 align:middle line:84%
or you know, it doesn't
matter what I say or do,

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.770 align:middle line:84%
my needs are not
going to get met.

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.136 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Right.

00:48:22.136 --> 00:48:24.389 align:middle line:84%
And so then you carry
that belief with you

00:48:24.389 --> 00:48:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and you experience
life through that.

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You talk with a tone that
supports that belief.

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So that when I hear you
in that tone, you know,

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that's subtly saying it
doesn't matter what I say,

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:35.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to override you.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: You, know I'm
going to respond to that tone.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:40.587 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's absolutely
fascinating.

00:48:40.587 --> 00:48:43.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I'm sure a lot of
people who just heard that are

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.401 align:middle line:90%
thinking I need to fix that.

00:48:44.401 --> 00:48:45.400 align:middle line:90%
I need to do what I can.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.000 align:middle line:84%
It's never too late to
adjust your frequency.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: It's never
too late, never to late.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
think that's the part,

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:52.090 align:middle line:84%
because it starts turning
into a chronic disease.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:55.480 align:middle line:84%
The longer we live, these
things become more disharmonic

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.860 align:middle line:90%
in the body as well.

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: They do, yeah.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.110 align:middle line:90%
It's like a car.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:59.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, if a noise
starts, it just

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:02.380 align:middle line:84%
gets bigger and bigger and
bigger until you correct it.

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:03.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:03.595 --> 00:49:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And let's move on
from that area and go

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to the notion of
being in resonance,

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.360 align:middle line:84%
again, the above, below
thing, going into resonance

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.250 align:middle line:84%
with the earth itself,
the Schumann waves,

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and the standing waves
there are interfacing

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.119 align:middle line:84%
with nature, what that does
for us, how that helps tune us.

00:49:19.119 --> 00:49:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Oh, absolutely.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:22.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are so
many different frequencies

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:26.630 align:middle line:84%
flying around out there,
right, cell phones and Wi-Fi.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.221 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: There's
a tremendous amount

00:49:29.221 --> 00:49:31.360 align:middle line:84%
of information in the
airwaves around us.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it
hard for us to be

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:38.840 align:middle line:84%
informed by the fundamental
frequencies of the planet.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So the Schumann resonance is
a sort of background radiation

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.970 align:middle line:84%
that is happening in
the ionospheric cavity

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:50.260 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.259 align:middle line:84%
And it's generated by all
the electrical activity

00:49:53.259 --> 00:49:54.550 align:middle line:90%
that's happening on the planet.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:57.250 align:middle line:10%
So all of the thunder,
all of the lightning, all

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:00.100 align:middle line:10%
of the electrical discharge
that's taking place

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:04.910 align:middle line:10%
creates a sort of fundamental
tone that's variable,

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:07.629 align:middle line:10%
but in the range of
around 7.83 Hertz.

00:50:07.629 --> 00:50:09.670 align:middle line:10%
That's sort of the mean
that they've established.

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:12.150 align:middle line:10%
And then there are
higher harmonics of that.

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:13.720 align:middle line:10%
Anytime you have
a fundamental tone

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.390 align:middle line:10%
that's an acoustic
frequency, you're

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:18.180 align:middle line:10%
going to get multiples,
so 7.83 times 2,

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.710 align:middle line:10%
times 3, times 4, and so on.

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of life formed with
this sort of pulse going on.

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Our brain waves are
also in that range.

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:32.550 align:middle line:10%
That is sort of a meditative
state in brainwave frequency.

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:33.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Alpha.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:36.960 align:middle line:10%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, the
alpha/theta cusp, exactly.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And so when we are in nature, we
are exposed to that frequency.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.310 align:middle line:90%
And we become entrained to it.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:45.120 align:middle line:90%
It relaxes us.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.960 align:middle line:84%
It takes us out of that
beta, you know, busy mind.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.946 align:middle line:84%
Which is often just
nonsense, you know.

00:50:50.946 --> 00:50:52.320 align:middle line:84%
What I've observed
in most people

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.720 align:middle line:84%
is that they spend a
lot of time and energy

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.810 align:middle line:84%
indulging their inner critic
and beating themselves up.

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And that inner division of sort
of self versus self, I think,

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.110 align:middle line:84%
underpins a lot of autoimmune
diseases that people have,

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:07.122 align:middle line:84%
because they become
inwardly divided.

00:51:07.122 --> 00:51:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But when we're able
to be in nature

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to settle down
into that reflective, you know,

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:17.010 align:middle line:84%
harmony, we go into
harmony with nature.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.260 align:middle line:90%
And nature is not frantic.

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not nuts.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of the times
after a nice hike or so--

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: You feel better.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.156 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but you
also might feel sleepy

00:51:26.156 --> 00:51:27.390 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, I need a nap.

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Because all of the
monkey brain activity

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.260 align:middle line:84%
has essentially
ceased by that time.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: That's right.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
especially if you

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:35.100 align:middle line:84%
haven't been doing a lot of
that and you're out of touch

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.330 align:middle line:84%
with nature, it can almost
seem like, oh god, it's

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:38.460 align:middle line:90%
so fatiguing.

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.540 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not fatiguing.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.805 align:middle line:90%
It's relaxing and calming.

00:51:40.805 --> 00:51:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: That's right,

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:42.484 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
don't understand

00:51:42.484 --> 00:51:43.620 align:middle line:90%
what that means anymore.

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:44.786 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: That's true.

00:51:44.786 --> 00:51:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And people are just so jacked up
and amped up and stressed out,

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and you know, not able
to receive and entrain

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.830 align:middle line:90%
to those frequencies.

00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
One of the things

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.700 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing
for a few years

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.020 align:middle line:84%
now that has completely
changed my life,

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and I was really stunned
by how much it affected me,

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.620 align:middle line:84%
was the practice of
earthing or grounding.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Getting rid of the rubber soles.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And getting
out in bare feet or I

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:10.530 align:middle line:84%
bought a bunch of
leather soled moccasins.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: And I wear
them most of the time.

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered from
doing that is that it brings us

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:19.794 align:middle line:84%
into electromagnetic equilibrium
with our environment.

00:52:19.794 --> 00:52:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you
go to the beach

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and you're walking
on sand and you're

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:27.600 align:middle line:84%
exposed to all those ions,
free ions, you become relaxed,

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.400 align:middle line:90%
you become more content.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the rubber soles
stop us from grounding.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
our natural tendency

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.750 align:middle line:84%
to discharge into
the earth and to also

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.370 align:middle line:90%
receive energy from the earth.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:43.609 align:middle line:84%
It's a flow going
down and coming up.

00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you're wearing rubber
soled shoes or insulators,

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.125 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't happen.

00:52:47.125 --> 00:52:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And so people end
up accumulating

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:51.000 align:middle line:84%
a lot of electrostatic
energy, which turns

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.235 align:middle line:90%
into inflammation in the body.

00:52:53.235 --> 00:52:54.414 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:52:54.414 --> 00:52:55.330 align:middle line:90%
And then you can tune.

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But you could tune
it out, right?

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Well, I can.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But still, why
gather it to begin with?

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Why allow these
disturbances to happen?

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Exactly.

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that
takes us to the subject

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.770 align:middle line:84%
of the magnetic field
of the Earth itself.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, it's
stated in the book.

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And this was Gregg
Braden's early work.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:12.300 align:middle line:84%
It's what brought him
to people's attention

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.227 align:middle line:84%
was this notion
of the dissipation

00:53:14.227 --> 00:53:15.810 align:middle line:84%
of the magnetic field
around the Earth

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:17.370 align:middle line:84%
over the last few
thousand words.

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:19.665 align:middle line:84%
In your book you
say, it's occurred up

00:53:19.665 --> 00:53:23.070 align:middle line:84%
to really the area
of 80% to 90% by now.

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Our brain functions on that
resonant magnetic frequency.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:31.124 align:middle line:84%
What is happening to us with
this dissipation in this field?

00:53:31.124 --> 00:53:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
This is very huge.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:33.550 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's important--

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's huge and no
one talks about it anymore

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: --that
people understand it.

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So a woman researcher did
these experiments in a room

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:43.140 align:middle line:84%
called a mu, M-U
room, where they

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.830 align:middle line:84%
were able to take out all
electromagnetic ambient

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:47.780 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, there was
no magnetic field at all.

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And so people in
this environment

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.066 align:middle line:90%
started just going to pieces.

00:53:54.066 --> 00:53:55.440 align:middle line:84%
They were just
falling apart, you

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.060 align:middle line:90%
know, for no apparent reason.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
reading those studies, yeah.

00:53:57.970 --> 00:53:59.095 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:59.095 --> 00:54:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And then when they restored
it, they were fine again.

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of
what we're seeing,

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:08.040 align:middle line:84%
they've seen in
geological records

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.400 align:middle line:84%
this decrease in the magnetic
field over the last 4,000

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.200 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.783 align:middle line:84%
And we've had
technology to measure it

00:54:12.783 --> 00:54:14.730 align:middle line:90%
for about the last 125.

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's just going down
and down and down and down.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.334 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in advance
of a pole shift.

00:54:19.334 --> 00:54:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's what a
Gregg Braden's original work

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:22.810 align:middle line:90%
was 25 years ago.

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah,
although it does

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.020 align:middle line:90%
seem to be accelerating.

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: You
know, since he started

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.100 align:middle line:90%
going into that research.

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's part of
why everybody kind of feels

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.880 align:middle line:84%
like they're falling
apart, you know.

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.213 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been reading
thing after thing about brawls

00:54:35.213 --> 00:54:37.860 align:middle line:84%
breaking out on airlines
and cruise ships

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and you know, people
just loosing it.

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In England last
week they put Nutella--

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.900 align:middle line:84%
no, in France-- put
Nutella on deep discount

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.490 align:middle line:84%
at this particular
supermarket chain.

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:51.450 align:middle line:84%
People were literally fighting
in the aisles over Nutella.

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Loading up their carts
like it's doomsday scenario

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're not going
to get enough Nutella.

00:54:58.850 --> 00:55:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But this, you know, same
with the Chuck E. Cheese,

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.930 align:middle line:84%
you know the Chuck E.
Cheese video about parents

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:06.210 align:middle line:90%
brawling at Chuck E. Cheese.

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:07.410 align:middle line:90%
We are losing it.

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:08.743 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: We're losing it.

00:55:08.743 --> 00:55:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I remember,
my primary intuitive source

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:13.950 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of information
over the less 30 years

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.990 align:middle line:84%
had said to me
about 10 years ago,

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:18.840 align:middle line:84%
this decrease in
the magnetic field

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.810 align:middle line:84%
is really going to
have a very noticeably

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:24.240 align:middle line:84%
serious impact on people's
functioning, their brain

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.350 align:middle line:90%
functioning.

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And they said, first it
comes out as incoherence.

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:29.962 align:middle line:84%
People start behaving
in an incoherent way.

00:55:29.962 --> 00:55:31.169 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: That's right.

00:55:31.169 --> 00:55:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they said, by
the time this increases really

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.650 align:middle line:84%
to its maximum, there will be
an inability to distinguish

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:38.580 align:middle line:90%
between what's real.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Dream time and
waking time, there'll

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:44.320 align:middle line:84%
be no way to distinguish
between them any longer.

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And that this is happening
en masse as a result.

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:51.250 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing was I said
yikes, what can we do about it?

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And they said, that's where it's
good, those technologies that

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:56.187 align:middle line:84%
come out with these
little magnetic devices,

00:55:56.187 --> 00:55:58.020 align:middle line:84%
putting them on your
body and so forth, they

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:00.097 align:middle line:90%
said they actually do help.

00:56:00.097 --> 00:56:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yes.

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
more coherent we are,

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:08.760 align:middle line:84%
the more we will be able
to withstand this decrease

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.680 align:middle line:90%
in the magnetic field.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.555 align:middle line:84%
If you're own magnetic
field is strengthened,

00:56:11.555 --> 00:56:13.470 align:middle line:84%
if your own inner
voltage is high,

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.450 align:middle line:84%
if your own degree
of inner order

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:21.000 align:middle line:84%
is high, because you're
a generator of that,

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.960 align:middle line:84%
so that can help
mitigate the influence

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.570 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening
in the outer.

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Now what I think will
most likely happen

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.340 align:middle line:84%
is that we will see this
magnetic field shift,

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and then the field will
come back stronger.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:37.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just this
period of dissipation

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and then reestablishment
that we all chose for.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.290 align:middle line:84%
We chose to incarnate
during this crazy time.

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:45.280 align:middle line:90%
And it is truly crazy making.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can say, it's
almost not people's faults.

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Exactly,

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
sense that they do not

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.140 align:middle line:84%
have the proper magnetic
brain support any longer.

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And you see it on the
road all the time.

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:58.166 align:middle line:84%
People are just--
people are losing it.

00:56:58.166 --> 00:56:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.123 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, we go
out on the road and say,

00:57:01.123 --> 00:57:04.570 align:middle line:84%
is this going to be a total kind
of like crazy day on the road?

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.109 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to be
an aggressive day?

00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Because you start seeing
patterns of behavior in people

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.070 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day on the roads
and the freeways in particular.

00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, and
Friday afternoons are the worst.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're the worst.

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:14.670 align:middle line:90%
So we have to be aware.

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And then also, I think
it's also hopeful to know

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:21.080 align:middle line:84%
that people who are
doing the science on this

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.700 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to create at
least a little devices here

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:24.600 align:middle line:90%
and there.

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.090 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to understand
we can't bombard ourselves

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:30.540 align:middle line:84%
with Wi-Fi and these
kinds of artificial waves.

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.760 align:middle line:84%
We can maybe wear a
little magnetic device

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.730 align:middle line:84%
on our body that helps draw
that magnetic field back

00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:38.806 align:middle line:84%
close in again so our brains
can function a little better.

00:57:38.806 --> 00:57:39.930 align:middle line:90%
There are things we can do.

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: There are
definitely things we can do.

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:43.454 align:middle line:84%
And I think just knowing
that it's not you.

00:57:43.454 --> 00:57:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Knowing
it's not you, yeah.

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: It's a
big relief for people.

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That this
is a problem en masse.

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And people will say, are
things getting weirder?

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they're getting weirder.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going to
get better anytime soon.

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:57.489 align:middle line:84%
Don't think that this is just
a blip on the screen, It's not.

00:57:57.489 --> 00:57:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's-- we only have
a couple of minutes left.

00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead and share
with us the best thing

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:04.980 align:middle line:90%
we can do for ourselves.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:06.510 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
some, little tick

00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:09.660 align:middle line:84%
list we can do to start bringing
the frequencies of sound

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:13.200 align:middle line:84%
back into our life and
self-healing and then move.

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Well,
easy ones are mantra.

00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:17.120 align:middle line:90%
You know, just toning a mantra.

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:20.580 align:middle line:84%
You know even
going aw, you know,

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:23.040 align:middle line:84%
you're resonating your
thyroid, your you're

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.950 align:middle line:84%
energizing your heart,
you're vibrating your bones.

00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:28.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, so all
of that is useful.

00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Singing, you know, sing in
the car, sing in the shower,

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:33.690 align:middle line:90%
sing in groups.

00:58:33.690 --> 00:58:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Go to kirtan, go
to join a choir.

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:41.280 align:middle line:84%
All of that really
makes a big difference.

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.725 align:middle line:84%
Follow your natural
inclinations.

00:58:43.725 --> 00:58:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Speak your truth.

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
Speak your truth.

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:48.405 align:middle line:84%
Express your emotions
in healthy ways.

00:58:48.405 --> 00:58:51.180 align:middle line:90%


00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I love Jerry
Tennant's description

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:57.520 align:middle line:84%
of electron donors versus
electron stealers, right.

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So you know, don't
hang out with people

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.954 align:middle line:90%
who are electron stealers.

00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to be
drained at the end of it.

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, you want
to have relationships

00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:07.450 align:middle line:84%
that's a two way street,
where it's give and take.

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:09.666 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
Really notice, you

00:59:09.666 --> 00:59:12.270 align:middle line:90%
know, when are you discharging.

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:14.250 align:middle line:90%
When are you recharging.

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:18.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, I talk about
this really simple exercise

00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.260 align:middle line:84%
where if you think
about doing something,

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:24.960 align:middle line:84%
does it make you feel aw or
does it make you feel ew?

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
it's that simple.

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:27.834 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
It's that simple.

00:59:27.834 --> 00:59:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And so if something
feels ew, it's

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.070 align:middle line:84%
going to be an electron
stealing experience,

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:34.530 align:middle line:84%
it's going to suck
the life out of you.

00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if something
feels aw, that's

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.100 align:middle line:90%
going to be an electron donor.

00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:40.230 align:middle line:90%
It's going to give you energy.

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And the more you choose
aw, the more your life

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:47.405 align:middle line:84%
unfolds as a kind
of aw experience.

00:59:47.405 --> 00:59:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it can seem
so totally superficial.

00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And years ago, I was absolutely
fascinated, obsessed with color

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and used to do lectures
on color therapy,

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:58.800 align:middle line:84%
because no one was back
then, this is 30 years ago.

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And I started noticing what
was happening when women would

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:07.440 align:middle line:90%
become overstressed or whatnot.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.320 align:middle line:84%
They would go shopping,
right, as a release valve.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Which is kind of depressing, you
know, when you think about it.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Going into a mall and
looking through things,

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:18.260 align:middle line:90%
it's depressing on one level.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.150 align:middle line:90%
But I realized what it was.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.530 align:middle line:90%
It was really simple.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You were being exposed to a
lot of different frequencies.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.195 align:middle line:90%
In this case, a lot of color.

01:00:26.195 --> 01:00:27.820 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
color coming at you.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So to go buy fingernail
polish or clothing

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:32.960 align:middle line:84%
was bringing a
frequency of color

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.780 align:middle line:84%
in that was breaking up
kind of the dullness of what

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:37.850 align:middle line:90%
you had just been experiencing.

01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the
buying of things, it

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.660 align:middle line:84%
was actually the
looking at things.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Which you can do by going
to museum or anything else.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
It was just kind of a
subconscious common way

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:49.355 align:middle line:84%
for women to go in
self-heal was to go shop.

01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you get in debt
and all that or you have--

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.840 align:middle line:84%
what do you call
it-- buyer's bulimia,

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.042 align:middle line:90%
you take everything back.

01:00:54.042 --> 01:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
Yeah, buyer's regret.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's again, you
know, this whole notion

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
of bringing these other
counter frequencies

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.900 align:middle line:90%
into our experience.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it can feel like
shopping aw, you know,

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.939 align:middle line:90%
an uplifting thing.

01:01:04.939 --> 01:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's not the
shopping, it's the experience.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.063 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Right,
the exposure to tone.

01:01:09.063 --> 01:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To tone and color
and light and so forth.

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Absolutely.

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's really--
yeah, that's really important.

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:14.604 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah.

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:17.930 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, so we can just be mindful
about the tonal inputs you

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:19.474 align:middle line:10%
know that we are experiencing.

01:01:19.474 --> 01:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's somebody who's
always going blah, blah, blah,

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:28.130 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah around us or you
know, music, even clothing,

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:29.450 align:middle line:90%
painting your house, you know.

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
painting a room a color.

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:35.790 align:middle line:84%
But they can also come
to someone like you,

01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
people that do tone
healing as well,

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.775 align:middle line:84%
to get kind of a real
acute bump to get in there

01:01:39.775 --> 01:01:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and start straightening
things out so that then you

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.640 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to
maintain it better.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Yeah, exactly.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's
another thing,

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:47.363 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of people
who discharge a lot,

01:01:47.363 --> 01:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
they are not very good
at asking for help.

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:50.909 align:middle line:10%
So recognizing that
you do need help,

01:01:50.909 --> 01:01:52.700 align:middle line:10%
you do need somebody
to come along and kind

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.490 align:middle line:10%
of tidy up your biofield
for you and just

01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:57.109 align:middle line:10%
help put you in more order.

01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful thing
about the work with sound

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:01.580 align:middle line:84%
is that it's really
efficient, you know.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've had many, many
sessions, and it's cumulative.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But even just a few can
be enough of a leg up

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.946 align:middle line:84%
to get you going in
the right direction.

01:02:09.946 --> 01:02:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, on that note, it's been
a fascinating conversation.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:14.542 align:middle line:90%
I think highly useful.

01:02:14.542 --> 01:02:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I love it when
something is useful.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAY MCKUSICK: Me too.

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Eileen.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAY MCKUSICK:
Thank you, Regina.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.858 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The name
of Eileen's book

01:02:20.858 --> 01:02:22.590 align:middle line:10%
is "Tuning the Human Biofield."

01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:24.230 align:middle line:10%
You can also reach
her on her website

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:middle line:10%
