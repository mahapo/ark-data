>> REGINA MEREDITH:
You're definitely the most

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.140 align:middle line:84%
interesting, trippy
person I have ever met.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.360 align:middle line:84%
It's as though you
live beyond the veil.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MAREN MUTER: Removing our
connection with the natural

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:84%
world, we have turned
ourselves into things.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're sadder,
because we're removing

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:84%
the observation
of life and making

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:90%
it the observation of me.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:84%
No matter how old we are, we
are such a beautiful child

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
that is learning and
doing the very best they

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:90%
can to get through this life.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think I'm going
to raise my vibrational level

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.120 align:middle line:90%
so I can get here.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
actually looking for

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:84%
is harmony, because on the
other side of the veil, that

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:90%
is what it is.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
If I get too far
from the hum, if I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:84%
didn't have that
connection, I think

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.827 align:middle line:90%
I would feel completely lost.

00:01:03.827 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think so too.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.815 align:middle line:84%
And most people do
feel completely lost.

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:07.615 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: When I first brought
Maren Muter on "Open Minds,"

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.350 align:middle line:10%
we spoke about the letters
she wrote beginning at the age

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:10%
of five to a woman she referred
to as the "Flower Lady."

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Their conversations were
deep, even prophetic.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going to dive
into the adult understanding

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.500 align:middle line:84%
of what she was
saying as a child.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Because now we
have science that's

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.280 align:middle line:84%
backed all this
stuff up, all these

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.440 align:middle line:84%
works on quantum
theory and things

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:90%
that you were already seeing.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:84%
You were already seeing
the nature of dimensions

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:90%
when you were a little kid.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I mean,
you're definitely the most

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:84%
interesting, trippy person
I have ever met in the depth

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:90%
of your understanding.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
It's as though you
live somewhere between.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:84%
It's though you live
beyond the veil almost.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.932 align:middle line:84%
And I know I said this
last time, but it's true.

00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's very rare that
people will ever meet someone

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.490 align:middle line:90%
or encounter someone like you.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted
to say, welcome,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.405 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so glad to be
in your presence again.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:03.905 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: Well,
thank you very much.

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And I do want to say
something quickly.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple of
people that have

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
asked me to extend you a
hello and say thank you

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.110 align:middle line:90%
for everything that you do.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.443 align:middle line:90%
And they really enjoy your show.

00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:14.318 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:02:14.318 --> 00:02:16.252 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: So I wanted
to extend that to you.

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I appreciate that.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Well received.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Good.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.882 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I've received it.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So today, we're going to
be going back and touching

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
on some of the letters you
wrote because they're profound.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to start
with one called "Mirrors."

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yes.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.698 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so I've let you
know we're going to do that.

00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's so wonderful.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing the real letters
that you stuffed in the jars

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:90%
all those years ago.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: Yeah, so this is the
real letter of the "Mirrors."

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: "Dear, Flower Lady.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a reason
we cannot see our own faces

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.970 align:middle line:90%
without a mirror.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're not
meant for us to focus

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:90%
on ourselves superficially.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to--" And you
said, superficially, F-I-S-H.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:90%
But you were what, like, seven?

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.576 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Super-fish-ially.

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Exactly.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you might want to--

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But let's
talk about that.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I think the thing about
focusing on ourselves

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:90%
has a lot of baggage around it.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying that
we're not supposed to--

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.110 align:middle line:84%
in this letter-- I
don't think we're

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
supposed to just be
focused on ourselves

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
at the center of our
lives, superficially

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:90%
being the key word there.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yes.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
it because through the last 40

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
years of new age kind
of doctrine and such,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.927 align:middle line:84%
you need to be at the
center of your life.

00:03:29.927 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:90%
You are the center of your life.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, we are.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:90%
It's our experience.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But that's different
than being always self-focused.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Correct.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
that and see what you really

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:90%
mean by that.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yes.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:10%
So in the letter, I was
making observations.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of the letters that
I wrote were observations.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And I came to the
conclusion that observation

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
was key to our
existence here on Earth.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:10%
And it's very hard to observe
our connection with nature

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.220 align:middle line:10%
when we're staring at
ourselves in the mirror.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:84%
When we walk into
a room and we're

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:90%
worried about how we look.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.487 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: And we are comparing
ourselves to other people.

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's called
self-consciousness,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:84%
which isn't really
very conscious.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: So self-consciousness
is a little different,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
or a lot different, than putting
yourself first or putting

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
yourself at the
center of your life.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at what does
it mean to put yourself

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:84%
at the center of
your life, it doesn't

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
mean that you are supposed
to do everything for yourself

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and make yourself the center
of attention of your life.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:84%
We look at your life and that
you are the common denominator

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:90%
in everything around you.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what it means
to be the center

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
or the center of
your own life is

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:90%
you are the common denominator.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm here with
you right now, for me,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:84%
the common denominator
in my life is me.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And you are you.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And I leave this room, my
common denominator in that area

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:90%
is me again.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's still your
observations and perceptions

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: It's your observations
and perceptions of reality.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: So it's very--

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
when we come back to this
letter, and we look at it,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and we say when people
fuss about their hair,

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:84%
they apologize
for how they look.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So they're apologizing
for themselves.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's no need to ever
apologize for who you are.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
They worry about their clothes
and they become a thing.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.122 align:middle line:84%
And more and more,
over the last few--

00:05:42.122 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's like
you're objectifying yourself.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.955 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: You're
objectifying yourself.

00:05:45.955 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And over the last few
decades, we've really

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:84%
had this movement where we
need to focus on the self,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:90%
we need to put ourself first.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And removing our connection
with the natural world,

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
we have turned
ourselves into things.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're sadder, and
we're not as happy,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and our lives
aren't as fulfilled,

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
because we're removing
the observation of life

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and making it the
observation of me, [LAUGHS]

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:90%
rather than the connection.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just think of the culture
that is dominant today--

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:90%
the selfie culture.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.795 align:middle line:84%
It's literally called the
selfie culture, right?

00:06:23.795 --> 00:06:24.595 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yes.

00:06:24.595 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With everybody
putting their super little

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
sizzle reel of themselves
out on whatever platform

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:90%
they're working with.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And the addiction to physicality
in terms of appearance

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.210 align:middle line:90%
is very--

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:84%
to me, I find it
very depressing when

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I see people
posting all of this,

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and their cute little
faces they make

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:90%
and pouty lips and all this.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
It just-- I find the
whole thing so depressing.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yes.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that stems from the
removal of parenting a child.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Let's just dive in.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
We were going to talk
about this later.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: We might as well.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's just get
into it because you're right,

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and people don't
want to hear that.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: No, they don't.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's doing our children
and ourselves a disservice

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:84%
when we try to
befriend our children

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:90%
while we're raising them.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.070 align:middle line:90%
That's not the role of that.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:84%
When we have our children
as our therapists,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.840 align:middle line:90%
when we're putting our--

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:84%
we have our career, and we
come home and our career

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:84%
remains more important
than the family.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter what
your family is made of

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and how it looks, but the family
is essential and important.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we divide
this, what we're doing

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.600 align:middle line:84%
is the children
that are growing up

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:90%
are needing specific parameters.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
They're needing
specific attention.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're needing
specific discipline.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And all of that is a
symbolization of love.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Love is discipline in a sense.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:90%
And love is giving parameters.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And love is loving
unconditionally to your child.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.630 align:middle line:84%
When the child feels that
they're lacking in that,

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:90%
what are we're going to do?

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start behaving in
ways that draw attention to us.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And so we just kind of look
over the last few decades

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.770 align:middle line:84%
that more and more attention
are being brought to the self,

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:90%
to us--

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.365 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: --through the selfies,
through taking pictures,

00:08:29.365 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:90%
through doing shocking things.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:84%
Shocking things to our body,
behaving in shocking ways,

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
because that's how we're
garnering attention.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we're
putting our self-worth.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.429 align:middle line:84%
Where our self-worth
isn't in the mirror.

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.522 align:middle line:84%
The self-worth isn't
behind the camera.

00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:47.105 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you
knew this at seven.

00:08:47.105 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: The self-worth--

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You could
see the dynamic.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: --is who you are.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, it's
who you really are.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Not the reflection
in the mirror you

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
have to keep capturing
to see if you're real.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: That is false.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Because that's false.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.342 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's interesting
because the way this is being

00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
reflected in pop culture
terms, the whole thing about

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:90%
parenting, is in films--

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:84%
when I was a little kid,
they had shows where

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:90%
they were very patriarchal.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:84%
The woman was washing
dishes with their pearls on.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:90%
The family was stable.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And you had a wise father and
usually a wise mother, though

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:90%
never quite as smart and wise.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:84%
But now, it's gone the other
end of the pendulum, where

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:90%
the parents are the idiots.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:84%
They're superfluous to
any deep conversation.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:90%
They're seen as dysfunctional.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.850 align:middle line:90%
The kids are the smart ones.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.380 align:middle line:90%
They're the parents' therapists.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Over and over you're seeing
the same story being propagated

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:84%
that the kids are the wise,
savvy, smart, responsible ones,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and their parents are
morons, essentially.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And what a shame,
disservice that we're

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
doing for our children, because
the children need guidance.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.715 align:middle line:84%
And they're not to
parent the parents,

00:09:59.715 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:84%
but that's literally
what they're doing

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.782 align:middle line:84%
is they're parenting
the parents.

00:10:02.782 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're
parenting the parents.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And so there's some truth in
these portrayals in the media,

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:84%
in entertainment right
now, which, I mean,

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I find it kind of
offensive on one hand,

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
if you're a parent
that is doing your job.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:84%
But these shows are made
mostly for adults not for kids.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.570 align:middle line:90%
But the kids are the wise ones.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So what you're saying is we need
to look at that because there

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:84%
is some truth that the parents
aren't showing up and doing

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:90%
their jobs.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're afraid
of their kids.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
take their devices away

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:84%
because they're afraid the
kid's going to be mad at them

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:90%
and not like them.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And then they have to go on
antidepressants and on and on--

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:90%
the barrage.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:90%
So how do you see it?

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.723 align:middle line:84%
If we could take it back to
something truly functional,

00:10:44.723 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
starting at home, because that's
where it's all going to happen.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: It always
starts at home.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Because that is--

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:84%
when people talk about we
want a solid foundation

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
in our life, first of all,
there is no such thing

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:90%
as a solid foundation.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Foundations always move.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
We look just at the tectonic
plates of the Earth,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to get physical
here, those are always moving.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're never going to
have a solid foundation.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.920 align:middle line:84%
The one solid
foundation you have

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:90%
is you, that common denominator.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the only place
that solid foundation is.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Your body is not even
a solid foundation.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Your body is changing,
and growing up, and aging,

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:90%
and having all of these things.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:90%
So it's really your soul.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.560 align:middle line:90%
That's your foundation.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
family, the family

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
is also then going to
be the closest thing

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that we can get to a foundation
in the fundamental years

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:90%
of childhood.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And when a child can come home--
they might have had a really

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.650 align:middle line:90%
hard day at school--

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.470 align:middle line:84%
they can come home and
they can speak openly

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:90%
with their parents.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Their parents can listen.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But the parents aren't
going to sit there and try

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:90%
to be the child's friend.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
The parent needs to provide
a safe, loving structure

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and environment for that
child to come and process

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
what it is experiencing
outside in the real world.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's bullies.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.830 align:middle line:84%
We're never going to
get rid of bullies.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But what we can do when we have
this home environment, whatever

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that looks like, is it allows
a child to process this

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and to understand this is how
I'm going to react and respond

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
to the bullies that I am
encountering out there.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And it gives the child
empowerment and strength

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:90%
to live their life.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:84%
When we don't have that,
we remove that empowerment,

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:90%
we remove that strength.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's not running around
and being, I'm empowered,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm empowered, and being a brat.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.600 align:middle line:90%
It's subtle.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:90%
It's calm.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:90%
It's peaceful.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.160 align:middle line:84%
That's what we talk
about when we have

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:90%
this strength within ourselves.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Quickly before we
move on from this--

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.070 align:middle line:84%
when we look at a
child coming home

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and they just want to drop their
stuff off and go off and be

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:84%
by themselves, that's a totally
normal and natural thing

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:90%
for a child to do.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But when we have devices that
we can default to-- so now

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:90%
we're coming in the home.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:84%
We have-- we're going to ignore
everybody there because we've

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:90%
had whatever day we've had.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we go in and
get on our device.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, the devices are
the modern day drug.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They are.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: And so
what it's doing--

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.787 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: On a neurochemical
level, they're a drug.

00:13:17.787 --> 00:13:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It's acting as a drug to
mute out everything else.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So the brain actually isn't
even processing the events

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:90%
that took place that day.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And so then they're doing
all of this on their devices

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.882 align:middle line:90%
and not able to process.

00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
But then they go out
into the real world,

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and then there's things that
we can never control out there

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.270 align:middle line:84%
from a bully or someone
we meet that's very kind.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know how to handle
those situations because now

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:84%
we're watching
television shows, we're

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:84%
watching whatever the media is
putting out there on how people

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:90%
are handling this.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So they can come out and be
a rude and obnoxious person

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
or they can succumb
to the pressure.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: And that is
abusing themselves.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So literally when we hand
those devices to the kids,

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:84%
we're teaching them
to abuse themselves.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree with that.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I've talked with many
people on this show

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:84%
from various angles regarding
devices and the brain

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:84%
because I'm very concerned
about the generation that's

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:84%
been raised on the devices,
and especially with really

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:90%
easy and open access.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Because this is a drug.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:84%
It is wiring the brain
in very specific ways.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, it's
deflecting any need

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
to actually have to
mature and integrate

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:84%
all of these challenges in
life on an emotional level.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.747 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Correct.

00:14:44.747 --> 00:14:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, everybody
can see that one.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.215 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think that
we're pretty clear on that.

00:14:49.215 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point
comes down to the self--

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:90%
what would you call it?

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Not self-centeredness.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:84%
The self-consciousness
of the parent

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.570 align:middle line:90%
maybe in wanting to be liked.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
look generationally

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.880 align:middle line:90%
because it's a progression.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the parent
that is needing

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:84%
to be liked by
their child was also

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
trying to search for
acceptance themselves.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: And so they're
looking for acceptance.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And I've got news
for you, your child

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
is going to accept
you and love you

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.700 align:middle line:84%
for who you are because
you are their parent.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't care what your
body shape looks like.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:84%
They don't care if you're going
to yoga or going to the gym.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:90%
They just care that you are you.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And that just innocent
love is so special.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And we each carry
it within ourselves.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And if we remind
ourselves that we

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:84%
carry this innocence within
us and this vulnerability

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:84%
within us, it
doesn't make us weak.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:84%
It makes us remember who we
are at the fundamental level.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is something that's
stunning and beautiful.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It really is.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And your letters, from
when you were a child,

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.100 align:middle line:84%
have that innocence of your
reflection of your parents

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to have tea with
them, or cookies with them,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:90%
and love them and be with them.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And it shows how kids--

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
it's a reminder of how we as
kids felt about our parents.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Exactly.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we
did, we wanted their--

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
yes, I think every child
wants some approval.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.295 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Of course.

00:16:28.295 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to feel like
you count and you matter

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:90%
and your contributions matter.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Exactly.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And right now
it's just one big cloud.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of running
around like chickens--

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: --without a head.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, we are.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So OK, that's one letter
to the "Flower Lady"

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:84%
is about the
self-consciousness and mirrors.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And we could actually
talk about that-- there

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of nuances in
there-- for a long time.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Exactly.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.878 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But let's move on
to the one that's about living

00:16:56.878 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:90%
both sides of choices--

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
--which is again,
this just amazes me--

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:84%
it's a little child, a little
girl writing these things.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And so really if we
look at that letter,

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
it's talking about
quantum superposition.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.089 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: It's talking about
how a single particle can be

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.960 align:middle line:84%
in multiple places
simultaneously at the exact

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:90%
same time.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:90%
One particle.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So that particle
isn't branching off

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.630 align:middle line:90%
like the division of the cell.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.940 align:middle line:90%
The particle is itself.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And it can be in multiple
places at the same time.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So in that letter that I wrote,
I wanted the "Flower Lady"

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:90%
to tell me hi.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So it was my birthday
and I got to pick

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.420 align:middle line:84%
between grasshopper
pie and a yellow cake

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:90%
with chocolate frosting.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I-- me writing the
version, writing the letter

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:90%
was the grasshopper pie.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, I also picked
the yellow cake, I know I did.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.033 align:middle line:84%
And that was a total
different branch--

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You mean-- when
you say you know you did,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:84%
is that more like in
a Mandela effect way,

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:84%
or you wanted both and you
in your heart chose both?

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: In a
Mandela effect way.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: I knew
that I branched.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was observing at
that moment two different life

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.120 align:middle line:90%
trajectories.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't imaginary.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that I had
a split in my brain

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and I had two different
personalities.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:84%
It was literally
that in my brain,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
it was observing-- so we go
back to this word "observation."

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:36.330 align:middle line:84%
It was observing both of the
outcomes of this choice, which,

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:90%
at that time--

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
which there is another follow-up
letter behind that one--

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.970 align:middle line:90%
that says my life is potential.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:84%
My life hasn't even begun
yet, even though I'm

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.510 align:middle line:90%
living it out right now.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
All of this is
potential, which then

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
starts talking about the
principle of least action.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And so in these
letters, I'm talking

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.280 align:middle line:84%
about these things
through child's language

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that I am living out the
principle of least action,

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.700 align:middle line:84%
meaning I'm living out
every single possibility.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I can
do this is because

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:90%
of quantum superposition.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk
quantum theory--

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.070 align:middle line:90%
I say this often--

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:90%
quantum theory is what it is.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a theory.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's the very
tip of an iceberg.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And so whether we mathematically
try to solve these equations

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:84%
or we take it into the lab
and we try to prove them,

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:84%
the mathematical version
and the taking it into lab

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.640 align:middle line:84%
are both observations,
meaning that there's

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:90%
so much more that we don't see.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
The tip of the iceberg
is that observation.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And under that surface is
what's really happening.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into a really
interesting topic to me

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and that is when it has
been put to the test.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:84%
We think we're
making that decision.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:90%
We think we're making it.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, when they've
done scans of the brain,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
they're watching
the brain line up--

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:84%
the decision has
already been made

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
before we even have
conscious awareness of what

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.550 align:middle line:90%
our choice is.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about
that from a quantum view.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So you've put the
question out, right?

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Somehow there's a
question or desire.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Correct.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And now all aspects of
mind, being, possibility

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
have come into play,
and it trickles down,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and boom, you think you
chose the yellow cake, right?

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Correct.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're going to step
way back here really quick

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
look at observation

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
because our life and observation
in our life is paramount.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Our overarching consciousness
doesn't reside in this body.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at this body
as an observational tool

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:84%
for our overarching
consciousness--

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
we're going to put that
over here for a second.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, at conception, when
the sperm hit the egg,

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't have
conception without death.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Meaning at the instant that
that happened, we died.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] OK?

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you wrote about
this when you were little too.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: I did
write about this--

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.262 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:15.262 --> 00:21:16.845 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: --when I
was little as well.

00:21:16.845 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
decision making, when

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:84%
we look at the idea
of having free will,

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
because at conception
we died, that

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
means that everything in between
that conception and that death

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:90%
has already happened.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, we take in the
principle of least action,

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:84%
which means that we
are based-- and this

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.665 align:middle line:84%
is such an abridged version,
so we're taking this

00:21:40.665 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:90%
with a grain of salt.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's OK.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Just make it really visceral
and easy to understand.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.290 align:middle line:10%
>> MUTER: Which means that
our observation of our life

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:10%
experience, how this body, this
combination of sperm and egg

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:10%
reacts and responds
to every stimulus,

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:10%
to every decision or
environmental going

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:10%
on, and then in the end, it
says this is the path that

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:10%
we're going to take.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:10%
But it has to observe every
single one of these options.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So your brain has
already processed that.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.542 align:middle line:84%
So it feels like we
are making a decision.

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
It feels like it hit
us right in the head

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.820 align:middle line:90%
and we are having yellow cake.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we do
that is because our brain

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely amazing.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.650 align:middle line:84%
The brain doesn't
just create the veil

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:32.250 align:middle line:84%
between the earthbound
plane and the ethereal.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:84%
The brain creates a veil between
each one of these trajectories

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.860 align:middle line:84%
because it's important for
it, for our consciousness,

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:84%
to observe each reaction and
response to these stimulus

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:84%
isolated in order to have a
correct understanding of what's

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:51.330 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:84%
So I can't have the grasshopper
pie and the yellow cake

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:84%
at the exact same time
on the same trajectory

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:84%
because it would become clouded,
because those decisions are

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:84%
going to branch off and create
new decisions or new situations

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to encounter.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So the power of observation,
what is our point and purpose

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:90%
here in life--

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and I know it doesn't
sound very sexy,

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:84%
but our important purpose
here is observation

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
of how we react and
respond to these situations

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.458 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetime.

00:23:22.458 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That is
a huge part of it.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, we're
walking right past ourselves.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:90%
We're not observing.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Oh, yeah.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're not
taking the time to observe.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.573 align:middle line:84%
And there we're
living on autopilot.

00:23:33.573 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's where free will--

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: We're
focusing on the mirror.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.762 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --becomes
deeply impacted.

00:23:36.762 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:90%
We're focusing on the mirror.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.590 align:middle line:90%
That was very beautifully put.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, free will
is just a subject

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm passionate
about in all ways.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:90%
And I love your piece of this.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: It's--

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because
Manjir Samanta-Laughton,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:90%
who is in England--

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed her before.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:59.615 align:middle line:84%
Manjir looks at it as
time and reverse time.

00:23:59.615 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And that-- you
have one of those?

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: May I
read this letter?

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And that it is all
already occurred,

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
but yet it's still all
fields of potential--

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --collapsing.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Correct.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, we become kinetic when
this life experience is done.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: And I equate it to
we are building a music note.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.200 align:middle line:84%
This life is a music note
and our consciousness

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.130 align:middle line:90%
is a symphony.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And this music note is
one part of that symphony.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:90%
But it is just potential--

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: --until it is done,
until this physical body is all

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:90%
done.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Until it is written.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: That's done.

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
has been written here?

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: So we're going to
look at time really quickly.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: It says,
"Dear Flower Lady,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.230 align:middle line:90%
this is a quick note on time.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Not on time time,
but about time.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:84%
When we look down time,
it can seem very long."

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So when we are looking
forward, it can seem very long.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:84%
"But when we look backward,
time isn't even there

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:90%
because it doesn't exist.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter when
something happened,

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:90%
just that it happened.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't even
matter that it happened.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.330 align:middle line:90%
It just colored us.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And when we look forward
in the forward time,

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:20.700 align:middle line:84%
we get to use these colors
to paint our future."

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's talking about how we're
going to react and respond

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and how we're going to
use our prior experiences

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%
in the future, but it also shows
that really truly time doesn't

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:33.850 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.730 align:middle line:84%
We can't turn around
and go backwards.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.520 align:middle line:90%
We can't change anything.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.850 align:middle line:90%
We can't do any of that.

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:90%
We can look down this way.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But what time actually
is is a measurement tool.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not its own dimension.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
tool of measurement.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.942 align:middle line:90%
And that's a whole other topic.

00:25:52.942 --> 00:25:53.742 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:25:53.742 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: But it's
absolutely fascinating.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is fascinating.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to one
thing and then get into time.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
talking about living

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:84%
both sides of our
choices, and we already

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:84%
talked about that a bit,
how valuable, or is it

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:84%
valuable, for us to go
back and take a moment

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:16.940 align:middle line:84%
to reflect what we feel a
trajectory would have been

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:90%
had we made the opposite choice?

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it worth it to
even bother to try

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
to analyze, to engage
mentally in that process,

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.180 align:middle line:90%
or just let it be?

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: We need to let it be.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.480 align:middle line:84%
When we look back,
we're always going

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:84%
to have 20/20 vision
no matter what it is.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.410 align:middle line:90%
I should have done that.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:90%
I could have done that.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:90%
I could have said that.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.230 align:middle line:90%
I could have made a decision.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:90%
But what is that actually doing?

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:90%
That's being cruel to yourself.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Saying I'm such an idiot,
I should have done that,

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:90%
and look where I am now.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:53.090 align:middle line:84%
We need to accept where we are
in our life, no matter what

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and no matter how we
got there, because it

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.350 align:middle line:90%
is part of who you are.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everything is an
opportunity for learning--

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Everything.

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --for
experience, for growth.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Everything.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Every bad decision.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: And because you made
a bad decision doesn't mean

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.010 align:middle line:90%
you're a bad person.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.948 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:27:07.948 --> 00:27:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: Because you
made a bad decision--

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:84%
you have to remember that
when you made that decision,

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:84%
you made that decision
with the best knowledge

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and understanding and the
situation that you were

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.780 align:middle line:90%
in at that time.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.020 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have the information
that you are going to have

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:90%
further down yet.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So don't beat
yourself up too hard

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.760 align:middle line:84%
because you did the best
you could with what you had.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And as--

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you
reduce it to this,

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller said, this
is all just one big experiment.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: It's all one--

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This life
is an experiment,

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.573 align:middle line:84%
and next life will be an
experiment, and on and on.

00:27:43.573 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: That's
why observation--

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:84%
this is an observational
experiment.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And even though it
doesn't sound great,

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like, warm and
loving, it actually is.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:90%
It is the epitome of compassion.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:90%
It is the epitome of humility.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:03.320 align:middle line:84%
It is the epitome of something
so much greater than love.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
This observation of
this life experience

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.240 align:middle line:84%
is creating that enveloping
light or that enveloping

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
darkness that people experience
on the other side of the veil,

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and they come back after
a near-death experience

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:84%
or out-of-body experience,
and they well up

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and they can't describe
what they felt.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:84%
But they knew they went home
and they want to go back.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's this love.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Universally, that
seems to be the experience.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: It is created by
the observation of this life

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.760 align:middle line:84%
experience, of your
life experience,

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.010 align:middle line:90%
of everyone's life experience.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:84%
That's contributing
to what you're feeling

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the veil.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:48.088 align:middle line:90%
That's how magnificent--

00:28:48.088 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Our lives are.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: --our lives are.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Truly are.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I'm going
to ask you something

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.940 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't planning on.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: OK.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But let's do it.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So now, if we look at our
lives with that kind of grace

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and say, in one sense, all
potentials have already been

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:84%
laid out from the moment I
was conceived-- potentials--

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I still had a choice
as to what potential,

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.810 align:middle line:84%
but there were factors that
were going to probably lead me

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:11.610 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:13.820 align:middle line:90%
I made that choice.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And now that choice
seems to have burned me.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And now what happens
is you have all

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.860 align:middle line:84%
of the emotions that
start pouring in that we

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.110 align:middle line:90%
need to start reconciling with.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And people who tend to go back
over their lives over and over

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.630 align:middle line:84%
and live in the past is a
very tortured place to be.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Oh, absolutely.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.525 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we all know that
when we've gotten stuck in mind

00:29:32.525 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:90%
loops ourselves.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So now we're talking about
the enfolding, management,

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.850 align:middle line:84%
amelioration-- whatever
you want to call it--

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:84%
of the emotions that
flood in after we feel

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:90%
we've made a mistake.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Like you say in your
book, skinned our knees.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.440 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:84%
When we have these
emotions, there's

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.030 align:middle line:90%
primary and secondary emotions.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And not a lot of
people talk about this.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at anger
and frustration and hate.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And these are going to be what I
would call a secondary emotion.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm not discounting them.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But what they are, they
are protective measures--

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: --to protect that
innocence and vulnerability

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.260 align:middle line:84%
that we were speaking
about earlier.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:90%
So those are protective.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So when you are angry,
when you are frustrated,

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
the best thing to do is
to sit back and say, what

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:90%
is it that I am angry about?

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:35.560 align:middle line:84%
So at first, it's going
to be because so-and-so

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:84%
did this, and blah, blah, blah,
or I made this stupid mistake.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.700 align:middle line:84%
But let's sit back
and say, OK, well,

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.340 align:middle line:84%
why did that make
you feel this way?

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we can come into
our primary emotions.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And our primary emotions really
are the love and compassion

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to have
humility in our life.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that
mistakes happen

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that we
are going to make mistakes.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's a compassion
towards ourselves.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a compassion towards
that inner innocence

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.780 align:middle line:84%
that we really
truly are children.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:18.360 align:middle line:84%
No matter how old we are, we
are such a beautiful child

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:84%
that is learning
and doing the very

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:24.450 align:middle line:84%
best they can to get
through this life that

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.323 align:middle line:90%
can be quite confusing.

00:31:26.323 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It can be quite
confusing because everyone else

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:34.230 align:middle line:84%
has their own individual play
playing out simultaneously

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and our fields intersect
with each other.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And those plays may be
at different stages--

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Exactly.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --at a given time.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Even in relationships,
you meet people

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that you just like instantly,
but their play and your play

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.590 align:middle line:84%
may not be lining up on that
perceived timeline scale,

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.520 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you sit
and say, darn it,

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and missed opport-- no, maybe
it's not a missed opportunity.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:84%
If your timelines
aren't lining up,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.310 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't an opportunity
to begin with.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Correct.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And if we just accept it for
what it is, which is that--

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and so maybe you met
that person and just that

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.725 align:middle line:90%
was a great meeting.

00:32:08.725 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:90%
I really liked that person.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.080 align:middle line:90%
And then you just move on.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:90%
But don't beat yourself up.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really truly--

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So having
compassion for our experience

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.350 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, whatever
decisions we make,

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.110 align:middle line:90%
is so filled with grace.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So we talked earlier,
we alluded to it

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.100 align:middle line:90%
briefly-- shaky foundations.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So part of the
reason people feel

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:84%
this angst and
everything is they

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.960 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's coming next.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, even the
tectonic plates of the Earth

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.130 align:middle line:90%
are shifting.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about connecting
with that pure essence

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.010 align:middle line:90%
at the core of ourselves.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:44.370 align:middle line:84%
For you, as someone
who is able to see

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.937 align:middle line:84%
and function and interact
very clearly with your core--

00:32:47.937 --> 00:32:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't mean you
don't make mistakes,

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:52.395 align:middle line:84%
and have boo-boos, and fall
down, and, well, break things--

00:32:52.395 --> 00:32:53.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:55.560 align:middle line:90%
--like everybody else.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.010 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about it from
that very fine elevated point

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
of view, how we
are able to tap in

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.530 align:middle line:90%
without a near-death experience.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: You want to know
how to tap in to that--

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Divine, everything
is perfect aspect of each one

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:14.850 align:middle line:84%
of us, because the world
around does move, it is shaky,

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and it can be scary, and
we can make bad decisions.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: All right.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So in order for us to connect to
that overarching consciousness

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:33.080 align:middle line:84%
to our divine being
of who we are,

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.050 align:middle line:84%
we need to learn silence
within ourselves.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's easier
said than done

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:41.950 align:middle line:84%
because our brain
has natural chatter.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And we are going
to make mistakes,

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and we are going to
fall down, and we're

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:84%
going to break our
legs, or whatever

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.610 align:middle line:84%
it is that's going to
happen is going to happen.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:84%
But when we can come into this
silence, come into this place--

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and I call it my
chocolate place.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, because
you're the chocolate lady.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: But it would be
like chanting a mantra.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.480 align:middle line:90%
The words don't mean anything.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So it would be like
stepping into the hum.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.239 align:middle line:84%
Start humming to
yourself or whatever

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:84%
it is to create vibration
within your body.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.650 align:middle line:90%
And for me, chocolate does that.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Or just the idea of
chocolate does that.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:90%
It's very soothing.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And when we can come
into that space,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.050 align:middle line:84%
then no matter what
happens around us, what's

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:84%
going to happen is
through that peace,

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.949 align:middle line:84%
through that
silence, through that

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:34.830 align:middle line:84%
stillness, that
touch of our soul

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.320 align:middle line:84%
is going to radiate and
shine right through us.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.130 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come in and you're
going to be able to feel it.

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you need to be
able to touch with the thing

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that brings you not
happiness but joy.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A subtle
sense of joy.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.623 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: Yeah, a
subtle sense of joy.

00:34:51.623 --> 00:34:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And I actually describe
it as a resonance.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
think I'm going

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.145 align:middle line:84%
to raise my vibrational
level so I can get here,

00:34:58.145 --> 00:34:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.440 align:middle line:84%
But what you're actually
looking for is harmony.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Because on the other side of
the veil, that is what it is.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.000 align:middle line:90%
It is harmony.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why I often refer
to it as a symphony

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and we're the music note,
because it's harmonic.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's a melody up there
that is your specific melody.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we can
find resonance-- so

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.760 align:middle line:84%
something that
resonates within you

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that brings you that beautiful,
vibrational note of silence,

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that is what is going to allow
this melody to come straight

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.600 align:middle line:90%
down and say you are OK.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if everybody takes
a moment right now and just

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.200 align:middle line:84%
thinks about it,
where is their true--

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean going out and
having shots with the girls

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and dancing, but the true
quiet, joyful, subtle place

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.512 align:middle line:84%
inside that makes your
heart feel lifted.

00:35:50.512 --> 00:35:51.970 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
each looking for.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And if they want to try an
experiment-- so if people

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.223 align:middle line:84%
are watching at home-- you want
to try and experiment and just

00:35:57.223 --> 00:35:58.920 align:middle line:90%
see how this works.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Pick two words, any
two words you want.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And all I want you
to do is repeat

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.740 align:middle line:90%
these two words to yourself.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to feel like
forever, but there's no time.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:12.502 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:12.502 --> 00:36:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Unless you
have to pick the kids up.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Repeat these two words for
10 to 15 minutes non-stop.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.600 align:middle line:84%
The words are just going to
end up becoming vibration.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It'll
be like a soup--

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:23.550 align:middle line:90%
a vibrational soup.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: It is.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:84%
But what's going to
happen is all of a sudden,

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:84%
you're going to feel sometimes
this "pop rocks" sensation

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that you don't even know
you have within your body

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.250 align:middle line:90%
settle down and calm down.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to be like, wow,

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:middle line:90%
life is actually very quiet.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
try that to find

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:48.950 align:middle line:84%
this stillness or this quiet,
repeat two words over and over

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.450 align:middle line:90%
and over and over again.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And soon you won't have to
repeat the two words constantly

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:84%
in order to get this space
because you'll recognize

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the feeling and
you'll be able to call

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.050 align:middle line:90%
upon this feeling at any time.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's just
identifying the feeling,

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.360 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't already
through meditation practice

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.920 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, just find it.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.100 align:middle line:84%
But the quality of the
words that are bringing you

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.720 align:middle line:90%
a soothing, joyful feeling.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.435 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it could be--

00:37:15.435 --> 00:37:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Chocolate.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Right.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Chocolate.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.500 align:middle line:90%
It could be actually any words.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:22.280 align:middle line:84%
It could be frog mug,
frog mug, frog mug.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.133 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:23.133 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But whatever
makes you happy.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.970 align:middle line:90%
That would make my sister happy.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:26.770 align:middle line:90%
She loves frogs.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:31.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's very simple.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Choose two words that you love
and just say them over and over

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:35.450 align:middle line:90%
and over--

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: Yeah, and they don't
have to have any meaning.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --for
about 10 minutes.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:90%
No meaning.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Just you love them.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.205 align:middle line:90%
They feel good.

00:37:39.205 --> 00:37:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Exactly.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You say them.

00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Turns into a soup, a hum.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.423 align:middle line:84%
And you felt that hum from
the time you were born.

00:37:44.423 --> 00:37:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: Basically,
from the time I was born.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.965 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From the
time you were born,

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:51.120 align:middle line:84%
you were aware of the hum,
the note of your life.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yes.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I hear the melody often.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.927 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So with you and life
going on-- and you have life

00:37:57.927 --> 00:37:58.760 align:middle line:90%
like everybody else.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.380 align:middle line:84%
You have your ups,
and your downs,

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and your stumbles
and skinned knees.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
you just consciously

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.653 align:middle line:84%
can shift into in a
moment now because you've

00:38:06.653 --> 00:38:07.820 align:middle line:90%
lived there your whole life?

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.800 align:middle line:84%
You've known the
hum your whole life,

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.392 align:middle line:90%
so you just go back to the hum.

00:38:11.392 --> 00:38:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: Yep, I just
go back to the hum.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't actually ever
feel myself shift.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to remind myself.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.485 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:38:18.485 --> 00:38:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You don't get too
far from the hum really, do you?

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: No.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.900 align:middle line:84%
If I get too far
from the hum, if I

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.980 align:middle line:84%
get too far from
the melody, I think

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I would collapse because it is
the essence of why I am alive

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.070 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:40.670 align:middle line:84%
It is the essence of
why I make chocolate.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:47.613 align:middle line:84%
It is the essence of why I
go about everything that I

00:38:47.613 --> 00:38:49.780 align:middle line:84%
go about and my connection
with the world around me.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have
that connection,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:58.805 align:middle line:84%
I think I would feel
completely lost.

00:38:58.805 --> 00:38:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think so, too.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.835 align:middle line:84%
And most people do
feel completely lost.

00:39:01.835 --> 00:39:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yeah.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.632 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So on that note,
as we finish our conversation,

00:39:05.632 --> 00:39:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
your fireside chats.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But I want to talk a
little bit about chocolate.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:84%
We have all these ideas
we've imposed upon ourselves

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.490 align:middle line:84%
about what we should
do and shouldn't do,

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.870 align:middle line:84%
which only takes us a further
away from the hum usually.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:21.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's like you said to me
this morning, Regina, go ahead,

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:23.950 align:middle line:84%
have chocolate-covered
orange slices for breakfast.

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:24.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, yes, that's
not what I normally do,

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:29.700 align:middle line:90%
but it's what I'd want to do.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:34.848 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in the hum, how
does that change everything?

00:39:34.848 --> 00:39:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: It's like eating the
chocolate-covered orange slice

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:90%
all day long.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:42.860 align:middle line:84%
There are times and
moments in our life

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.270 align:middle line:90%
that are absolutely devastating.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know we didn't get the
chance to talk about some

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:40:00.590 align:middle line:84%
But when we have situations
that we think we cannot survive,

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:05.750 align:middle line:84%
being able to call upon or find
this melody or find this hum

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:10.730 align:middle line:84%
allows all of the emotion,
allows all of the pain,

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:15.690 align:middle line:84%
allows all of the joy to rush
through your body at a cellular

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:16.490 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:18.365 align:middle line:84%
And we have to remember
that we're not solid,

00:40:18.365 --> 00:40:21.660 align:middle line:84%
so it's literally
flowing right through us.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:90%
And we could feel all of it.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:28.810 align:middle line:84%
But there is-- and I don't want
to use the word appreciation--

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:35.610 align:middle line:84%
but it is, I would say
humility, where you understand

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:41.150 align:middle line:84%
that there is something so
much more powerful out there

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and that what you're
feeling now is

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:47.900 align:middle line:84%
a testament to the
depth of love that is

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the veil.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And that hum or that melody
that flows through you

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.870 align:middle line:90%
is saying you're not alone.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.220 align:middle line:90%
It is saying you are loved.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.350 align:middle line:90%
And you can get through this.

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:07.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like someone coming
and as you're on your knees,

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:13.240 align:middle line:84%
wrapping their arms around you
and holding you and saying,

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm right here.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.400 align:middle line:90%
And that I'm right here is you.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: That is you holding
that innocent piece that is

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:22.987 align:middle line:90%
feeling injured.

00:41:22.987 --> 00:41:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
so important right now

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.412 align:middle line:84%
because suicide rates
have skyrocketed.

00:41:27.412 --> 00:41:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And we were going
to talk about it,

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:90%
but I would like to come back--

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.210 align:middle line:84%
have you come back another
time and go into suicide

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.430 align:middle line:84%
from a much more
elevated level of looking

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.850 align:middle line:84%
at what happens when all
possibilities are there

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and things start
playing out in this way.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Yes.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think suicide is a very
important topic to talk about.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Not many people have studied
what actually suicide is.

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.470 align:middle line:90%
But suicide isn't a choice.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.090 align:middle line:84%
People that are
committing suicide

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:00.495 align:middle line:84%
have no choice, just as you have
no choice that you have cancer,

00:42:00.495 --> 00:42:02.370 align:middle line:84%
you have no choice if
you have heart disease,

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:04.650 align:middle line:84%
you have no choice if
you're getting hit by a car.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Suicide is the exact same thing.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a very natural act.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And it begins with unicellular
organisms commit suicide.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:19.200 align:middle line:84%
At the cellular level,
cells commit suicide.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And animals and plants both
have what is a suicide gene.

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Our body is an animal.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:31.795 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
if we have a chance

00:42:31.795 --> 00:42:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to come back and
talk about that,

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:36.620 align:middle line:84%
we open up with what
is suicide and what

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:40.670 align:middle line:84%
does it look like in the
brain as the brain inflames

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.450 align:middle line:90%
and the people have no choice.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And then when we hear
mediums or someone say,

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:50.300 align:middle line:84%
your person that you loved
that committed suicide,

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.020 align:middle line:90%
they didn't mean it.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, they didn't.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.500 align:middle line:90%
They had no control over it.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.390 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to commit suicide.

00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is, before
we continue, is they are OK,

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and they're safe,
and they're loved.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:06.190 align:middle line:90%
And they're not in trouble.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.810 align:middle line:90%
They're not in time-out.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.030 align:middle line:84%
They're not having
to learn a lesson.

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a very natural
thing that they

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.450 align:middle line:84%
had to go through that was very,
very painful here on Earth.

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.710 align:middle line:90%
But they're out of pain now.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's just an opener
and a tease toward a larger

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.290 align:middle line:84%
conversation next
time I have you on.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But Maren, thank you so much
for everything you've shared.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And just very briefly,
you have fireside chats,

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.820 align:middle line:84%
I learned, where hundreds
of people show up.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Like at a real fireside?

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:35.643 align:middle line:90%
What are these?

00:43:35.643 --> 00:43:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: They started
out as a real fireside.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MUTER: And then when COVID
hit, they moved to online.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've just started
opening them up to Zoom.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I have monthly
fireside chats.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.300 align:middle line:10%
What I do is I
pool the questions

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.540 align:middle line:10%
that I get most
often for a month

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.330 align:middle line:10%
and then I'll answer those
questions during that fireside.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
question off the table.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
that we can't discuss.

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And so once a month, we
get people coming in.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And I have two sessions, two
firesides, one in the morning,

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.460 align:middle line:84%
one in the evening,
that way if you're

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.825 align:middle line:84%
in another part of the
world, you can join in.

00:44:10.825 --> 00:44:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.340 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.735 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Marenmuter.com.

00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All right.

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:16.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, very good.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.195 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much
for letting me know

00:44:18.195 --> 00:44:19.320 align:middle line:10%
that that's even happening.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.240 align:middle line:10%
I've got to join in and see what
some of these questions are.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.115 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:22.115 --> 00:44:23.490 align:middle line:90%
I thank you again, Maren.

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Just absolutely delightful
and joyous having you here.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.728 align:middle line:90%
>> MUTER: Thank you, Regina.

00:44:27.728 --> 00:44:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's no
writing like Maren's.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Her new book is called
"Your Quantum Brain."

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Nothing like it.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.120 align:middle line:10%
It uses baking as a metaphor
for our quantum reality,

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.200 align:middle line:10%
so, of course, I love it.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.970 align:middle line:10%
Stunning, delicate writing.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.890 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.780 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.830 align:middle line:90%
