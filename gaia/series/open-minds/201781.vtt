>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The History Channel's

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:10%
been grinning over their hit
project called "Project Blue

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.870 align:middle line:10%
Book."

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a series of episodes
depicting ET or UFO contact

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:84%
which was then investigated
by the military.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:84%
These cases were often
denied by the government,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:84%
though the experiencers
were clear on what they saw.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
The star of the show is
an astronomy professor

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:84%
from Ohio State
University, Allen Hynek,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:90%
who has long since passed away.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:84%
But his son Paul
is with us today

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to tell us the truth
about his father's life

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:90%
and what he experienced.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:90%
And welcome.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.088 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad to see
you here in the flesh.

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:53.422 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL HYNEK: Thank you, Regina.

00:00:53.422 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Happy to be here.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know, this is
to me such a wonderful project

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
that History Channel took
on, because it shows the dark

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:90%
and the light of it all.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It didn't show it in its
full truth, obviously.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:90%
There are some artistic license.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:84%
But it took real
cases, and it actually

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.397 align:middle line:84%
depicted the bones of
the real cases, you know?

00:01:12.397 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Even though your mom was made
to look a little different

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and your dad, and
so forth, and we'll

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:84%
get into some of
the other intrigues

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.457 align:middle line:90%
that may not have been real.

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But we're in the shadow of
the government at the time.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
What to me is so
fascinating about it

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.693 align:middle line:84%
is that this is what
I call basically,

00:01:29.693 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:84%
everyone's waiting
for disclosure.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:90%
This is disclosure.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Right.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:90%
You say with a little d.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
happening all around us.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:90%
It's been happening for years.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Stop waiting for them to land
on the White House lawn, right?

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into
who your dad was

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and how your dad got hooked into
this project with the military.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:10%
So how my dad got into
his side hustle of UFOs--

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:10%
because he was an
astronomy professor.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And in World War II, he
worked on the proximity fuse,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:84%
which helped stop the
V-1 bombs over London.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Then he worked on
Project Moonwatch,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:84%
which was the first massive,
international citizen science

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.370 align:middle line:84%
approach with 12
observatories around the world

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and more stations to
track the movements

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
of the first
artificial satellites.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So they were the
ones on the ground,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
tracking Sputnik in the very
early days, in the late '50s.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And then he was asked by
the United States Air Force

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:84%
to help them investigate
what they then

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:90%
called flying saucers.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think my father
thought it must

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
be just a couple weekends of
work, easy to dispatch and put

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I think he'd had
no idea at the time

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that his pesky, fourth-born
child would be here

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:84%
some 50 years later,
talking to you about this.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:90%
But he was a patriot.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And back in those days,
when the Air Force asked

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:84%
you to help with something, he
was all too happy to oblige.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And it turned into a 20-year
affiliation with the Air Force,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and then sort of a passion
play of his afterwards.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting,
because most people look at it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:90%
and say, but, OK.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:90%
He was an astronomer, right?

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:90%
And so why did they choose him?

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Why was he uniquely positioned?

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Because he was watching the
artificial satellites in space,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:84%
so he could kind of
detect artificial

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:90%
from natural phenomena.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.485 align:middle line:90%
Was that part of it?

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: It could be.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he had top
secret clearance from his work

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:90%
on the proximity fuse.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And just as
important, I think he

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
was the nearest warm
bodied astronomer

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.840 align:middle line:84%
to Wright-Patterson Air
Force base in Dayton, Ohio,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:90%
while he was in Columbus, Ohio.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure how
picky they were.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
They needed a PhD to give
some academic credibility

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:90%
to the exercise.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I think he fit
the bill quite nicely.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.738 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But yet in the end,
when you start looking at how

00:03:48.738 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:84%
he was utilized,
at least the way--

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
certainly the way
it's been depicted,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.625 align:middle line:84%
because people are going to
go watch this if they haven't

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:56.925 align:middle line:90%
already on the History Channel.

00:03:56.925 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's really good to
get you laying it out,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
have you lay it out
for us to begin with.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.227 align:middle line:84%
So he's brought in after
an event, after a witness.

00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
it actually functioned.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Sure.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, in the first
season, the structure

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:90%
is a real reported case.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And then my father and
his Air Force counterpart

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
go and investigate, and then
have machinations and drama

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:90%
with the higher ups.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing that the
show accurately depicts

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:84%
is that Project Blue
Book really wasn't set up

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to investigate and get
to the bottom of things

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and reverse engineer
propulsion systems for UFOs,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:90%
but was to manufacture answers.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And those answers should be
nothing to see here, folks.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:90%
Please disperse.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:90%
We have this under control.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And you see this argument
going back and forth

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:84%
between the higher
ups and your dad

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and his counterpart
in the military.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Now the counterpart
in the military,

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:90%
what is the man's name again?

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: So the actor is Michael
Malarkey, who actually grew up

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes from Wright-Patterson
Air Force base in real life.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, he did?

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And he
plays Captain Quinn,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of an amalgamation
of the five different Air Force

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:84%
directors of Project Blue Book
that worked with my father.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Now he is set up as a skeptic.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And as sort of a company man
who's loyal to the Air Force.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And in real life,
that was the case.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.200 align:middle line:84%
They were Air Force
people who had

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
NDAs and all this sort
of duty to country,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
worrying about
national security,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
whereas my father was
interested in science.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So even if you had a great
individual like some of them

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:84%
were, they were looking
for different things

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.228 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:05:34.228 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
he was also being

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.180 align:middle line:90%
paid to find different things.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that was his loyalty.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:90%
That was his pay grade.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:90%
That's what he was there to do.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So Project Blue
Book was ostensibly,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
as you say, to really, truly
investigate the phenomena as it

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:84%
was coming into the
military's awareness

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:90%
through various sources.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So as we start down this road,
your father, first of all,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:84%
is he open to the notion
of extraterrestrial life?

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Or is he closed when they first
tapped them on the shoulder

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:90%
for this?

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.608 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: He was quite closed.

00:06:04.608 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was a bunch
of post-war bunkum, just

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:90%
sort of national hysteria.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And so again, he
thought it would be

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:90%
very quick work to dispel this.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, people
say he became a believer.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's a
great word for a scientist.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:90%
I think scientists accept data.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So over time, he came to
accept the accumulated

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:90%
weight of the data.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Not just this case or that
case, but a sort of commonality

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:84%
of cases from around the world,
over the years, that made him

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
feel, there really is a
bona fide phenomena here.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of the insights he had
was he wasn't studying UFOs.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:90%
He was studying UFO reports.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't have a UFO
in a Petri dish to dissect.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:90%
He had the witness accounts.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.667 align:middle line:84%
So he focused on
that, and that's

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
how he came up with
the classification

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.667 align:middle line:84%
system of close encounters of
the first, second, and third

00:06:56.667 --> 00:07:00.580 align:middle line:84%
kind so there'd be a kind
of common, scientific rubric

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:84%
or classification system so
scientists around the world

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:90%
could compare apples to apples.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:90%
And he did a lovely job.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he did his job, right?

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's see what
happens when he first

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
encounters something that he
thinks isn't a bunch of bunk.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: You know, and this
gets to the people objecting

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.660 align:middle line:84%
about mainstream science,
rejecting alternative notions,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
whether it's ancient archaeology
or UFOs or psychedelics,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.640 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's really
that mainstream science has

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
an active wall that they
put up to reject things.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.120 align:middle line:84%
It's really encompassed
or comprised

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of individuals
who are very busy,

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.183 align:middle line:90%
who are seeking grant money--

00:07:41.183 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is key.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.558 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: --and they want to be
consistent with their grant.

00:07:44.558 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really
have time to look

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%
at alternative theories.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:90%
There's no incentive for them.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and maybe
they don't want to lose

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:90%
credibility--

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.387 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Especially with UFOs,
there's the stigma involved,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.640 align:middle line:90%
so we have that as well.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really
a coordinated effort

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
on the part of mainstream
science to reject something.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just that there's no
incentive for the people,

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and there is disincentive
for a lot of them

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
to get involved in some of these
more sort of fringy fields.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now your
dad's in this fringy field.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And by virtue of that,
your mom too, so to speak.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about where
things began shifting for him

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.380 align:middle line:84%
where he started,
through the data,

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:84%
understanding these
people aren't all

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:90%
making this stuff up.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most
compelling witnesses

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
were Air Force pilots
who are calm under fire,

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
literally, who go through
really traumatizing situations

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
with a very calmness
and a checklist,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:84%
whose eyesight is very
good, who have no incentive

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:84%
to report a flying saucer or
an unidentified flying object.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And there can be multiple
witnesses at the same time

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.278 align:middle line:84%
and radar corroboration
or gun camera

00:08:53.278 --> 00:08:55.570 align:middle line:84%
footage like in the recent
disclosures in "The New York

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Times."

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:90%
So they were very compelling.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time that this
sort of case history built up,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
you know, in reality,
Project Blue Book

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:90%
investigated over 12,000 cases.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And even with this
very strong mandate

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:84%
to put them all under
the rug, they still

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:84%
couldn't explain
over 5% or 700 cases.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So my father noticed
that there was

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:84%
this growing body
of compelling cases

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:90%
with highly credible witnesses.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, he saw
the increasingly dismissive

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:90%
attitude from the Air Force.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And those things just
did not go together.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:90%
And you know, there's--

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So if we get into some of
the highly credible evidence

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen, I've
been curious about this.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with
some archival footage that

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:84%
was in one of the episodes where
the military was apparently

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
doing an experimental shot
to the moon with a warhead.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.030 align:middle line:84%
That was actually brought
about in disclosure

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle line:84%
in Steven Greer's
"Disclosure," and they

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.477 align:middle line:90%
showed the original footage.

00:09:59.477 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
It looked the same
as the footage that

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.770 align:middle line:90%
was shown in Project Blue Book.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Did they in cases use some
archival footage like that?

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: In sort of the credits.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But in the show, they
actually recreated it.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And the production value
in the show is so good--

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazingly
well done show.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: It's Robert
Zemeckis' cinematographers,

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
so it's got a really
filmic feel to it.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.858 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's
wonderfully done.

00:10:21.858 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't recommend
it highly enough.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm going to show my
little 12-year-old stepson.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: Oh, you're going to
take them down the rabbit hole.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.043 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he finally
has started reading and going

00:10:32.043 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
to some sites,
saying, you know, I

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:84%
think there are other
species out there,

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.032 align:middle line:84%
and I'm willing to
accept the notion.

00:10:38.032 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought, good.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Can't wait to show
him Project Blue Book.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:40.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: It's nice to have that
sort of openness of spirit.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.017 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's been super closed,
so now he's just opening up

00:10:47.017 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of things all
at once, because he's

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:84%
been very clear on
his point of view

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:84%
on everything politically and
all the way through history.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.315 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: Well, he has a stepmom
as a wonderful resource.

00:10:55.315 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Who listens to their
stepmom anyway, right?

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So now, you were talking
about these pilots

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:90%
that had had these experiences.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Now the way it was
set up in the series,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Captain Quinn had also
had an experience.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was living in deep
conflict with himself.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yes.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.665 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of bubbles
up, and he sees--

00:11:14.665 --> 00:11:16.270 align:middle line:84%
you know, his job
as we talked about,

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:90%
he's the loyal company man.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
strict kind of company.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But then you have this
scientist who's very credible,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
who is not out there in
whack-a-doodle ville.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
He wants to find
the answers as well.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:84%
But when they have these
shared experiences of things

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be perhaps a
threat to national security

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and can't be answered by
this really smart scientist,

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that starts to bring him on
his own character arc as well.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
is to have your dad

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.630 align:middle line:90%
like Indiana Jones-style.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:90%
They're out.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Right after an incident,
boom, they're in their car

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and they're on their
way to an event.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.200 align:middle line:84%
How often did your dad
get out in the field

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.852 align:middle line:90%
and actually talk to witnesses?

00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:84%
How often-- and we
see part of that

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:84%
versus data that had been
gathered and given to him.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Very often.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:84%
He went around the world,
investigating cases.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And my good friend Calvin Parker
of the famous 1973 Pascagoula,

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Mississippi sighting
told me recently

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:84%
that he and Charlie Hickson
finished up their report

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
with the police department about
11:30 PM that Sunday night.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
They both went back to work,
which is amazing enough,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:90%
at the shipyards in Pascagoula.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And my father was
there the next morning

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.808 align:middle line:90%
at 7:00 AM in the HR office.

00:12:30.808 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:90%
So he really was on it.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: So Calvin
to this day does not

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.790 align:middle line:84%
know how my father
got there that fast,

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:90%
because we lived in Chicago.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think he must have
already been on the Gulf Coast

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.397 align:middle line:84%
for some kind of
business and got the call

00:12:43.397 --> 00:12:44.230 align:middle line:90%
and went over there.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
But that's very interesting
how fast he got there.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.897 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
part is true, then.

00:12:48.897 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:84%
We're just laying all this
out so as people watch,

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.522 align:middle line:84%
they know what's
true and what's not.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Now in the show, your mother
is this very glamorous

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and very gutsy and very
self-assured, self-sufficient

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:90%
woman.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.665 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:12:59.665 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And your mom was.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: She was
very much that way.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, the show and the
actors, Aidan Gillen, my TV

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:84%
dad, and Laura
Mennell, my TV mom,

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
they are fantastic actors
and wonderful people.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And I talk with
them quite a lot.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.077 align:middle line:84%
And what they
wanted to do, which

00:13:14.077 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I think is appropriate
for a show like this,

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
is not have everything
be accurate,

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:84%
but to be authentic to the
kernels of the characters

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
sort of transport

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
this understanding of the
main aspects of the characters

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and then play them
realistically in these sort

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.862 align:middle line:90%
of dramatized situations.

00:13:32.862 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And they did a really
good job with that.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And just for the
record, Regina, I

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:84%
want to say that having the
super villain from "Game

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.620 align:middle line:84%
of Thrones" play your TV father
is not super creepy at all.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.270 align:middle line:90%
That's so funny.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, it seemed to me like
he did a really incredible job,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:90%
though, didn't he?

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: He did.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I went to
the set several times,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and I've spent a lot
of time with Aidan.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.630 align:middle line:84%
He has this knack
for observing people.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
scene that was in one

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:84%
of the first episodes of the
first season where he's driving

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.433 align:middle line:84%
and he's chasing what we call
unknown or an unseen man.

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And between takes, he would
come over and talk to me

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.878 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the set.

00:14:14.878 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And one time when
he was walking away

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:84%
from me with that hat
and a trench coat,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:90%
I felt my father there.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
that interesting?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And Paola, who first turned me
on to your dad, because Paola

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:90%
worked directly for your dad--

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.962 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --said the one
thing that was missing

00:14:29.962 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:84%
was we didn't have
his pipe on him.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your dad
always had a pipe, right?

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Bless Paola Harris's heart.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:90%
And she's told me this.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the showrunner
who's a friend of mine,

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and he said that the
issue with that is It

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:90%
can produce continuity issues.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And also, his feeling is
that a pipe sort of connotes

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.140 align:middle line:84%
stagnation, that
you're sitting around.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted this
more sort of frenetic,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.290 align:middle line:90%
out of control feel.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:90%
And they got it.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back to real life,
your dad's involved in this,

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and now he's starting to
see that he's actually

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe a shill for the
military on certain levels.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.790 align:middle line:90%
And he's not feeling respected.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.998 align:middle line:84%
He's feeling there's
some dishonesty going on.

00:15:08.998 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
What happened in
your dad's life when

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.215 align:middle line:84%
he realized they were using
him to quash these stories?

00:15:13.215 --> 00:15:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: That's a
really good question.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think my father felt he
had three groups of stakeholders

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.980 align:middle line:90%
that he had to be mindful of.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.230 align:middle line:84%
One was the government
and the military,

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:84%
another one is
mainstream science,

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and then there are-- called
them believers of UFOs.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.435 align:middle line:90%
These are very different groups.

00:15:29.435 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And I
think he felt he had

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:84%
to be sort of in the Venn
diagram in the middle,

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:84%
keeping each of them at
least mildly unhappy.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And then he was doing
the right balancing act.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, he thought a
lot about, hey, look.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
This is not-- clearly, after
1953 with the Robertson panel,

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:84%
it was clear that this
was more of a PR exercise

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.313 align:middle line:84%
than a bona fide
scientific pursuit.

00:15:52.313 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So he thought quite
a lot, and he talked

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of his friends.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Should he stay involved?

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And over time, he felt,
yes, because if I am here,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I can help influence--
not control--

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:84%
but I can influence which
cases are investigated

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and how they're investigated
and how the data is recorded.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the world will have
access to that data afterwards.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But if I leave now in a huff and
say with righteous indignation

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.250 align:middle line:84%
that this is below my
scientific standards,

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:84%
there will be no science
done there at all.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So he felt he had a duty
to stay there and make

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:84%
it as scientific and
open as possible,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and then to use that data later
in a very "Open Minds" manner.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your mother,
because she was his confidante,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:90%
and she had her own mind.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
not a weak woman.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:84%
How did she factor into this as
his partner and as your mother?

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, explain
how this filtered down

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.440 align:middle line:90%
to the family.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And were you raised on the
subject of UFOs, and so forth?

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So how it filtered
into your lives.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: So this show
in the first season,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:08.613 align:middle line:84%
TV mom is more sort of the
archetypal '50s housewife.

00:17:08.613 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
deliberate decision

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:90%
on the part of the producers.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.589 align:middle line:90%
And we had told them, look.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Our mom was a very strong woman
and became an important figure

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:90%
and ufology in her own right.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted to show that
sort of arc of her character

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:90%
along with my father.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:84%
In real life, she was
a very strong woman.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
My father traveled all
the time, so my mom

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:84%
did a lot of the raising
of us by herself.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And that included all
the physical activity

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:90%
in and around the house.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.960 align:middle line:84%
She would dig holes in the
backyard, fix the plumbing,

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.990 align:middle line:84%
decide where we went to
school, all these things.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we were raised with
an intellectually stimulating

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.067 align:middle line:84%
and versatile
jack-of-all-trades mother.

00:17:52.067 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
interesting combination.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think all
five of us children

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:84%
feel very fortunate to have
had the upbringing that we did.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And how that bubbled down to
us and growing up with UFOs,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:84%
some of my earliest memories
are flying saucer ornaments

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.445 align:middle line:84%
on the Christmas
tree or Father Gill

00:18:08.445 --> 00:18:09.820 align:middle line:84%
from Papua New
Guinea coming over

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.890 align:middle line:84%
for dinner, or Travis
Walton, talking

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:90%
to Calvin Parker on the phone.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember a time when
UFOs weren't part of my life.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And by extension, science,
astronomy in general,

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:84%
sort of having this open
attitude toward science.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think if I can kind
of crystallize the feeling

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:84%
both of my parents
had, there was

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
a sign I saw at a march for
science that's sometimes

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:84%
attributed to Richard Feynman,
which I think sums up the two

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.020 align:middle line:90%
types of people in the world.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather have
questions I can't answer

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.330 align:middle line:90%
than answers I can't question.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And so with UFOs,
this is a riddle and an enigma

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and a conundrum with
eight more layers.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.890 align:middle line:84%
We feel like we're
getting closer,

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:90%
but we never really know.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think for something
like this, you have to be--

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and this gets back to what we
talked about with scientists--

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:84%
you need to be open
when confronted

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:84%
by what seems to be a new
phenomena that can be annoying,

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:90%
against your beliefs, et cetera.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:84%
But just as important,
once you come to feel, hey,

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.720 align:middle line:84%
there is a phenomena
here, you need

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to keep your mind open so
that you don't flail around

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:84%
for the best available answer
at the time and shove that in.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:90%
It's very tempting.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.197 align:middle line:90%
We want instant gratification.

00:19:27.197 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:90%
They wanted answers.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Right.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And even if you
have an open mind,

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
we are pattern matching
mammals, and we want answers.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It's uncomfortable,
the more big questions

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that you have that
you leave unanswered.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's a natural tendency
to try to fill in an answer,

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's important for
something like this

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:90%
to not do that right away.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And the answer may
involve extraterrestrials.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:90%
That may be part of it.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But there are some indications
that my father and Jacques

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Vallée and Paola and others have
believed for a long time that

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial hypothesis
doesn't seem to explain

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.417 align:middle line:90%
the totality of the phenomena.

00:20:03.417 --> 00:20:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're talking
interdimensional and many

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:90%
other phenomena.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.428 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Quite possibly, yes.

00:20:07.428 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is-- and we're
talking about time and space

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:90%
collapsing.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
parallel realities.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.715 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
extradimensional--

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:17.515 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Exactly.

00:20:17.515 --> 00:20:19.223 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, all
these other factors

00:20:19.223 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:84%
are playing in because
our five senses in a sense

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:90%
are so limited.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:84%
We can't discern
necessarily what

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:90%
we've just been exposed to.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:90%
And it does.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.393 align:middle line:84%
It makes it so
much more complex.

00:20:29.393 --> 00:20:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:10%
And you know, my father
called his first book

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.420 align:middle line:10%
on the subject "The
UFO Experience."

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Not "The UFO Sighting."

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the sighting in
UFO reports is often not

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
even the most traumatic
or most important

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.830 align:middle line:84%
part of what the
witness reports.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
They may talk about
communication before, during,

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:90%
and after the sighting.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's this sort of totality
of the overall experience that

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.450 align:middle line:90%
really marks them.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And the sighting is
not a small part,

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's just not
the chief part.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are also issues with
the extraterrestrial hypothesis

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.870 align:middle line:84%
that aren't trivial
problems with that

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
that really lend you to believe
that there is more than that.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And Jacques Vallée has a quote
along the lines of, when we get

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.152 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of this, if
it's only extraterrestrial,

00:21:18.152 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be disappointed.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:90%
And it probably isn't.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.300 align:middle line:84%
There are far too many
other interesting phenomena

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.860 align:middle line:84%
that are being
explored to limit it

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to something such as an artifact
from a third dimensional

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:90%

that they appear and disappear

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:90%
and seem to have a purpose.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And all this
communication really

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
seems to transcend nuts
and bolts visitations

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:90%
from other planets.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you're talking,
again, the mind interface

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:47.663 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:21:47.663 --> 00:21:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
I'm curious about.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:84%
When your father
was out interviewing

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:84%
all of these people
over these years,

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:84%
was there some kind of
common theme that popped up,

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:84%
whether the people were
more filled with just terror

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:84%
or wonder, whether they
felt altered in a good way,

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
in dread for the
rest of their lives?

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.352 align:middle line:90%
What kind of theme popped up?

00:22:09.352 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: I think
it's all of those.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: There's
a whole spectrum

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
of people who had different
beliefs before going into it.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Typically, policemen
and Air Force personnel

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:84%
would be more reluctant to
believe in the phenomena,

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
both by personal disposition
and professional training.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards, I saw
and I talked to many witnesses

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:84%
myself, very different reactions
where people sort of fit it

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.990 align:middle line:90%
into the fabric of their lives.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.270 align:middle line:84%
They felt that they
had been selected

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:84%
for some kind of purpose
that maybe they didn't grasp.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And other ones who were
just flat out terrified.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And would talk about
it with my father

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.730 align:middle line:84%
because he was very
sympathetic, and he

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:84%
talked with thousands
of people about what

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:84%
may have been the most traumatic
experience in their whole life.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.820 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't really
want to dwell on it.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.040 align:middle line:84%
But if they came to the
Hynek house for dinner,

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:90%
that's kind of the quid pro quo.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, a whole spectrum
of how people reacted to it

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and whether they thought
it was good or bad or both.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:84%

peek at a clip, OK?

That's episode one, right?

00:23:26.265 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a peek,
and then we'll

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.807 align:middle line:90%
talk about it afterward, OK?

00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:29.607 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: OK so this is
called "The Fuller Dogfight."

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And it has a lot of
implications, but one of them

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is he was hearing
something from a radio

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:90%
station in his hometown.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Not in his local vicinity.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So tell us the truth
about what was going on

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.150 align:middle line:90%
with "The Fuller Dogfight."

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Right.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.400 align:middle line:84%
That's patterned after the
Gorman dogfight in real life.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.888 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
interesting case where

00:24:12.888 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:84%
the pilot felt that there
was communications that

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:90%
really couldn't be happening.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.605 align:middle line:84%
And so the showrunner
asked my brother and I, who

00:24:18.605 --> 00:24:20.460 align:middle line:84%
were both consultants
on the show,

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
hey, what are the
physics involved

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:84%
in hearing a radio station
from San Diego when

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:90%
you're in South Dakota?

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a bit above my
pay grade as a French major,

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
but my brother Joel said,
well, that could actually

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.607 align:middle line:84%
happen if the troposphere
is low enough,

00:24:33.607 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:90%
and yada, yada, yada, yada.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.952 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't the answer
they were looking for.

00:24:36.952 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:84%
They wanted that
to be impossible.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It turns out it's
not impossible,

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:84%
but highly improbable, which is
often how things go in science.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So we let them know that
it's most likely not

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.000 align:middle line:84%
going to happen, but
that sort of sets up

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.350 align:middle line:84%
this theme throughout the first
season of this communication

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.770 align:middle line:84%
that goes beyond a sighting
and a feeling of control,

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and indeed, of
innate intelligence.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting,
because I know people

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:90%

incapacitated for a time.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:84%
She'd been in the hospital, and
she was hearing things, right?

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.400 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't on drugs,
because she was

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:90%
too sensitive to take drugs.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.530 align:middle line:84%
But she was definitely
kind of in another world.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And she kept listening, just
listening to what was there.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turned out
after this bit was over,

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.470 align:middle line:90%
a song came out on the radio.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.762 align:middle line:84%
She said, that's what I've
been listening-- it was new.

00:25:35.762 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Brand new.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.973 align:middle line:84%
And it was in production
apparently at the time.

00:25:38.973 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And she'd been listening to
it before it was ever debuted.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: While it
was in production?

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:84%
She was hearing it into another
domain, in another place,

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.810 align:middle line:84%
in another location while
it was being created.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.540 align:middle line:84%
But it had not been
released yet on the radio.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:90%
It was brand new.

And she said, oh my God.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:84%
That's the song I have been
listening to in my head,

00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about it, and our
mind works in mysterious ways.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.110 align:middle line:90%
We know that-- your dad knew--

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:middle line:84%
there's this unified
field of consciousness.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Why couldn't you hear
into another place

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.543 align:middle line:84%
if something created
a resonance for you?

00:26:12.543 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of bridge.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A bridge.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.197 align:middle line:84%
So in that case, he may
have been hearing something.

00:26:18.197 --> 00:26:19.113 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:26:19.113 --> 00:26:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They just went
ahead and assigned it

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.870 align:middle line:84%
in a warm and fuzzy way
to what they wished.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, the dogfight
itself was really the point.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
it did to that man.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:30.415 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Mm-hmm.

00:26:30.415 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And then later in
the season, you

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:84%
see Captain Quinn in his
own kind of dogfight.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And he comes away really
changed by feeling

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.910 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence that
came from these orbs that

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:90%
are all around him.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in the way
this one was portrayed,

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:84%
it just seemed to
stop and protect

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:90%
his craft at the same time.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a
protection around him.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I don't know
how I got through this.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's happened
a lot with these reports.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.013 align:middle line:84%
They could overtake
us at any time.

00:27:01.013 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing we could do.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:84%
We felt like it was
suspended animation.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, we
couldn't do anything.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:90%
We were paralyzed.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:90%
And it all ended up OK.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:84%
What's sort of
common in reports is

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.430 align:middle line:84%
this feeling of overwhelming
superiority and power

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:20.750 align:middle line:84%
often accompanied by a fairly
neutral feeling, that they

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:90%
don't often feel--

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
because well,
frankly, if you feel

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:28.350 align:middle line:84%
this overwhelming superiority
and a hostile atmosphere,

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.600 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to be around.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But they feel it's either
sort of neutral or benevolent.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And it is this intelligence--
they sort of grok,

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.490 align:middle line:84%
they sort of feel
all around them.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And so often, they won't
engage with the guns

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
anymore, because they know
it's just completely futile.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what did some of them
go away with from your father's

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.860 align:middle line:84%
rendering in terms of a sense
of what that was all about?

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Did they feel they were
just being given a warning?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:84%
What did some of these
pilots feel afterward?

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Because this is part of what
has been really subsequently

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:90%
in "The New York Times."

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Starting 2017, I believe, "New
York Times" started releasing

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.710 align:middle line:90%
these old, archival stories--

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.110 align:middle line:90%
yeah, bigger D disclosure.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.100 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.985 align:middle line:90%
So what do these pilots--

00:28:17.985 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I know you can't
speak for all of them.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:84%
But what did your
father feel they were

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.360 align:middle line:90%
grokking from the experience?

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.775 align:middle line:90%
What was the point?

00:28:24.775 --> 00:28:26.525 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: There's a
spectrum with that too.

00:28:26.525 --> 00:28:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Some witnesses feel that there
was some kind of message,

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and some other ones
just felt helpless.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.360 align:middle line:10%
One of my good
friends is Kevin Day,

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:10%
who was the radar operator
on the USS Princeton, which

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:10%
is next to the Nimitz for
the famous 2004 sighting.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And I challenge anyone
to talk to Kevin

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and not see the sincerity
that just comes away from him,

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:90%
that comes out of him.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:84%
He's still struggling to come to
terms with the enormity of what

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.090 align:middle line:90%
he saw.

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.540 align:middle line:90%
And he saw it on radar.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.450 align:middle line:90%
The Nimitz saw it on radar.

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of people
saw it on binoculars.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.570 align:middle line:84%
The gun camera footage
at the same time.

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.290 align:middle line:84%
The Navy has verified this
and opted to disclose it

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.760 align:middle line:90%
to "The New York Times."

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.423 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: So you have
all these-- which

00:29:14.423 --> 00:29:16.770 align:middle line:84%
is a completely different
stance than the Air

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Force in the days
of Project Blue Book

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.325 align:middle line:84%
where my father was
who was always saying,

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:90%
we have this under control.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Please disperse.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to see.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:84%
The Navy is saying,
you know what?

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:90%
We see hundreds of these things.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what they are.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
We could use a
little bit of help.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Kevin, his primary
thing, because he

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:84%
is such a wonderful,
caring man, a 20-year Navy

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:84%
veteran, the first
thing he thinks about

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.450 align:middle line:84%
is the danger it
poses to Navy aviators

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.245 align:middle line:84%
who are up there
flying around and who

00:29:44.245 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what's going to
happen with these things who

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.410 align:middle line:84%
are demonstrating
motions that we

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.635 align:middle line:90%
can't do with Earth technology.

00:29:51.635 --> 00:29:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that makes sense,

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.920 align:middle line:84%
because he has to
remain in control,

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:90%
and he's out of control.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.045 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And so he's more
concerned with the safety

00:29:58.045 --> 00:30:00.390 align:middle line:84%
of Navy aviators,
and now he's started

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.590 align:middle line:90%
thinking of what they might be.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And also, he wants to put
together an expedition

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.440 align:middle line:84%
to go to the same spot
in the ocean with a team

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
full of scientists and
very sensitive instruments

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
to see if we can
detect more of these.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.140 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Now let's look at another clip.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.630 align:middle line:84%
This one is called "The
Flatwoods Monster."

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And this was interesting,
because as it

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:84%
was depicted in
the film, the kids

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.670 align:middle line:90%
went away with radiation burns.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the question is,
if they're making this up--

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and the mother, how did
this happen to my children?

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:37.276 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a little
peek at it first, OK?

true story behind this?

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: So there is a
sighting of something monstrous

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:14.620 align:middle line:84%
in the woods, and my father
wasn't sure what it was.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Some people think it was
great large owls in the woods.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.785 align:middle line:84%
But there are the
reports of sort

00:31:19.785 --> 00:31:21.160 align:middle line:84%
of radiation burns,
which are not

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.327 align:middle line:90%
really consistent with owls.

00:31:22.327 --> 00:31:23.620 align:middle line:90%
At least not any owls I know.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: So it's just
one of these cases

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.850 align:middle line:84%
where you have these various
strands that stand out

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:30.650 align:middle line:90%
and say, look.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:33.580 align:middle line:84%
We can't just dismiss it
easily, but then there's

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.317 align:middle line:84%
not that much evidence
to go on after that.

00:31:36.317 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
the burns, and this

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.233 align:middle line:84%
is one of the cases that
helped inspire the movie "Close

no, it's just owls,

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.760 align:middle line:90%
how did he feel about that?

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:84%

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
biggest example of this

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:84%
was in 1966 in
Hillsdale, Michigan,

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:18.790 align:middle line:84%
with swamp gas, where--
and I've actually

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:23.230 align:middle line:84%
found video footage of that
press conference where he says,

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.870 align:middle line:84%
parts of it could be
explained by swamp gas.

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:84%
But nuances aren't often
kept and maintained

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:32.450 align:middle line:84%
by the press in these sort of
highly charged atmospheres,

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and so they said,
Hynek says it's

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.690 align:middle line:84%
all swamp gas, with an overly
dismissive, big paintbrush

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:90%
stroke.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:84%
But that was something he
thought was very unfortunate.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led
then Congressman Gerald

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Ford to pressure the
United States Air

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Force to have a committee to
investigate how Project Blue

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Book was investigating cases.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And that led to the Condon
committee right here in Boulder

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.790 align:middle line:84%
to then say, there's
nothing with UFOs.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:84%
But if anybody looks online
and finds the Condon committee

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:08.050 align:middle line:84%
report, the report itself
makes an overwhelming case

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:84%
for the existence of
UFOs, but the conclusion

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.970 align:middle line:84%
doesn't jive with the
data in its own report.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very controversial.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's now go to your mom.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Now she's been through all
of this, and as you say,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:84%
your mom became a player
in the UFO scene herself,

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.530 align:middle line:84%
so let's talk
about her role now.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Because at the
end of season two,

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.090 align:middle line:84%
you can see she was
starting to get involved.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Your mom is now starting
to get her nose--

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.790 align:middle line:84%
she's poking her nose
around in these affairs,

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.965 align:middle line:84%
and it's pissing
off everybody, OK?

00:33:35.965 --> 00:33:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
your mom really did.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: I think my father
got people interested in UFOs.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Here is a highly credible,
nuts-and-bolts astrophysicist,

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.350 align:middle line:84%
rocket scientist who helped
with the war efforts who says,

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:52.270 align:middle line:90%
yeah, there's something here.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.145 align:middle line:84%
I think people had an
innate understanding

00:33:54.145 --> 00:33:56.020 align:middle line:84%
that he wouldn't say
that unless there really

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.850 align:middle line:90%
was something solid.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But it was my mom who was really
salt of the earth, from Ohio.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And when people
heard her talk, I

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.430 align:middle line:84%
think they would be more
inclined to say, well,

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:11.080 align:middle line:84%
if Mimi Hynek believes
this, I think I will too,

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.150 align:middle line:84%
because she could relate
to people like that.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And my father started,
after the dissolution

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:84%
of Project Blue Book, the
Center for UFO Studies.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.429 align:middle line:84%
And I think my mom was
instrumental with that,

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:24.190 align:middle line:84%
because my father had the
vision for what it wanted to do,

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.710 align:middle line:84%
but my mom was more sort
of the administrator who

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.659 align:middle line:90%
actually made things happen.

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And without her, I don't think
it ever would have taken off.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.402 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so she
continued that for how long?

00:34:34.402 --> 00:34:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Oh, for years.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.050 align:middle line:84%
She was the editor of the
"International UFO Reporter."

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:40.030 align:middle line:84%
She helped organize
UFO conferences.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:45.159 align:middle line:84%
And she drove right in, not just
as that sort of earlier '50s

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:48.250 align:middle line:84%
housewife, but because she was
genuinely interested herself.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.213 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
Columbus, Ohio, right?

00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she didn't
have a lot of natural allies

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.429 align:middle line:90%
in the neighborhood.

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:55.229 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:34:55.229 --> 00:34:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And then in Evanston,
Illinois, where I think you'd

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:00.940 align:middle line:84%
have to go quite a few blocks
to find people who at that time

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:84%
were waving UFO flags
in their front yard.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean, we always
hear about Wright-Patterson Air

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Force base.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:08.560 align:middle line:84%
We hear about a
lot of creepy stuff

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.330 align:middle line:84%
about Wright-Patterson
Air Force base.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.645 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, your dad had
warm blood, he had a PhD,

00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:90%
and he was right near it.

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.110 align:middle line:90%
What's up with Wright-Patterson?

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: I don't know.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Colonel
Robert Friend was

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.180 align:middle line:84%
one of the Air Force
directors of Project Blue Book

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and was my father's favorite.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.050 align:middle line:84%
This guy worked on
Project Blue Book,

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:34.070 align:middle line:84%
he worked on the space shuttle,
and he flew 150 combat missions

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:35.630 align:middle line:90%
as a Tuskegee airman.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:middle line:90%
He's a true American hero.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And I met him through the
production of Project Blue Book

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and spent his 99th
birthday party with him.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: (WHISPER) Wow.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And this man was
asked for a promotional spot

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:56.160 align:middle line:84%
for the show, were alien bodies
ever taken to Wright-Patt?

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.600 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.385 align:middle line:84%
Alien bodies wouldn't
go to Wright-Patt.

00:35:59.385 --> 00:36:00.510 align:middle line:90%
That was a mechanic center.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:04.410 align:middle line:84%
They'd go to the burn
base at Fort Hood, Texas.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Now clearly, the question was--

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.950 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of the question
was, did you see alien bodies?

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Not just to deny
where they were taken.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.623 align:middle line:84%
But he was a skillful
Air Force man.

00:36:15.623 --> 00:36:17.040 align:middle line:84%
He answered the
question directly.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Alien bodies would not
have been taken there.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So he sort of
sidestepped the question.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Now at his 99th
birthday party, I

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:84%
asked him, I leaned
over and whispered

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.710 align:middle line:84%
in his ear, Lieutenant
Colonel Friend,

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm just your former
partner's son.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.430 align:middle line:90%
You can tell me.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Did you see anything
super compelling?

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:44.820 align:middle line:84%
His eyes lit up with
this big sparkle.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So I planned to
follow up with him,

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.840 align:middle line:84%
because he also lived where I
live in Southern California.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he
died soon thereafter.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:57.460 align:middle line:90%
That's horrible.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't want a
book to end that way.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.480 align:middle line:90%
No sequel.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And this is a
guy who even at that point

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:84%
had taken oaths not
to reveal things.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:84%
But he came as close
as he comfortably could

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:16.577 align:middle line:84%
to his friend's son to tell
me that he had seen something.

00:37:16.577 --> 00:37:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was more the
spirit of the question than,

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.250 align:middle line:84%
no, alien bodies
weren't taken there.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.583 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, then you go
to Lieutenant Colonel Philip

00:37:22.583 --> 00:37:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Corso and some of what he
states in his book, "Day

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:90%
After Roswell."

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I also have interviewed
Maurizio Biata.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
what he had seen

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.320 align:middle line:84%
by way of some
film that was taken

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.150 align:middle line:90%
in the '40s from some crash.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.520 align:middle line:84%
It was very emotional
for him to talk about

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.560 align:middle line:90%
as a deep-digging journalist.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Artifacts do exist,
but mostly it's

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.130 align:middle line:90%
in the memory of these older--

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Paola talking to the mortician
at Roswell, the nurse that

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.280 align:middle line:84%
was in attendance
with him that had seen

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.440 align:middle line:84%
the bodies, the
public information

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.970 align:middle line:84%
officer for the
military who said,

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:58.520 align:middle line:90%
we've had a crash at Roswell.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Uh, what are you saying?

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Uh, actually it's
just weather balloons.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, everyone covering
up from the top down.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And it takes so much to
piece these things together,

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.473 align:middle line:84%
but at least you got
a piece of that piece.

00:38:09.473 --> 00:38:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And you
know, Paola's one

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.080 align:middle line:84%
of the few people that
does serious field

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.740 align:middle line:90%
investigations as a journalist.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She is
not given her due.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Partly I think
because she's female

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and she's agreeable.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Paola.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Paola.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Paola lifts everybody up.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.860 align:middle line:90%
She knows everybody.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:90%
She introduced you to me.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.093 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me to you.

00:38:26.093 --> 00:38:28.650 align:middle line:84%
She's introduced me
to virtually everybody

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.800 align:middle line:84%
that has really close
contact with what happened.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: And she digs deep.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Roswell,
some of the things that

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:40.200 align:middle line:84%
are most compelling to me aren't
this or that piece of evidence,

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.908 align:middle line:84%
but it's the behavior
of people involved.

00:38:41.908 --> 00:38:42.708 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:42.708 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: So Roswell and the
Navy I find very interesting,

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:50.490 align:middle line:84%
because Roswell, the air
base commander one day

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.590 align:middle line:84%
apparently felt that
he could understand

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:56.370 align:middle line:84%
the difference between tinfoil,
rubber, and balsa wood,

00:38:56.370 --> 00:39:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and weird shapeshifting
alien alloys,

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and made the decision that
was approved at some level

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:07.230 align:middle line:84%
to tell the press that they
had captured a flying saucer.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:11.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to be pretty
sober and pretty sure

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:90%
about your hand to do that.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, ever since then
they've been walking it back,

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.250 align:middle line:90%
but that's the fact.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Now you have the
Navy saying, we see--

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.790 align:middle line:90%
they call them UAPs and USOs--

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.650 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
to do about them.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.210 align:middle line:90%
How about a hand?

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Those two things you
simply can't dismiss.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you think
about UFOs, you've

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:40.580 align:middle line:84%
got the air army at
that time and the Navy

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:44.690 align:middle line:84%
admitting either we've
captured a flying saucer,

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:47.005 align:middle line:90%
or we see tons of these things.

00:39:47.005 --> 00:39:49.130 align:middle line:84%
To me, those are some of
the most compelling things

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:50.453 align:middle line:90%
ever to happen in this field.

00:39:50.453 --> 00:39:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Now you brought it
up, so let's go there.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.970 align:middle line:90%
So now you're continuing on.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We'll see what happens with the
show, "Project Blue Book," who

00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.440 align:middle line:90%
picks it up.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And I want to see
more of these seasons.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.407 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely love what
the team is doing.

00:40:04.407 --> 00:40:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's wonderful to turn
people on to it and say, hey,

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.570 align:middle line:90%
it's slightly fictionalized, OK?

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:09.740 align:middle line:84%
They're having a
little fun with it.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.000 align:middle line:90%
However, these are real cases.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, it gives
the name of the real case,

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:16.577 align:middle line:84%
shows the real people, shows the
real footage, which is really,

00:40:16.577 --> 00:40:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I think, a brilliant
call, what you've done.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.190 align:middle line:90%
You can have a family.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.122 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one person
believes in UFOs.

00:40:22.122 --> 00:40:23.330 align:middle line:90%
But it's really entertaining.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.950 align:middle line:90%
It's this rip roaring yarn.

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Come for the entertainment.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Stay for the facts.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And it makes the
tent bigger, you know?

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:31.947 align:middle line:84%
We can have almost
an echo chamber

00:40:31.947 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:84%
of people that already believe
things, but like "Close

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Encounters of the Third
Kind," "Project Blue Book,"

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and other pieces of either
some fiction or all fiction

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:44.053 align:middle line:84%
really make the tent bigger
for more people to come in

00:40:44.053 --> 00:40:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and have a responsible
discussion.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And with "Close
Encounters" in the '70s,

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.390 align:middle line:84%
it made it so much more
comfortable for people to say,

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:52.190 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.840 align:middle line:90%
I've seen something like this.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.995 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:54.995 --> 00:40:55.910 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So I say, quit sitting
around, waiting

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.940 align:middle line:84%
for the saucer to land
on the White House lawn.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.523 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure's happening
all around you.

00:41:03.523 --> 00:41:04.482 align:middle line:90%
It's already happening.

00:41:04.482 --> 00:41:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.722 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a fait accompli.

00:41:06.722 --> 00:41:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Now you just see how you want
to plug in, study it, get

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.070 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with
it, or reject it.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.290 align:middle line:90%
That's each individual's choice.

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So now you, you're
continuing on.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, you're the spunky
little monkey of the kids,

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.040 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.370 align:middle line:90%
This is your thing.

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you're continuing
on your own research.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the areas that you're
fascinated with and researching

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:30.710 align:middle line:84%
is USOs, Unidentified
Submerged Objects.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I find this fascinating,
because some of them

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.470 align:middle line:90%
have been caught on tape.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:35.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.777 align:middle line:90%
And I remember about--

00:41:36.777 --> 00:41:38.060 align:middle line:90%
hmm.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.980 align:middle line:84%
It was somewhere
between 2006 and 2010.

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the year
now, was that footage that

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.370 align:middle line:84%
made the evening news
for a couple of days

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.160 align:middle line:84%
off the coast of Los Angeles,
I think off Catalina--

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.870 align:middle line:90%
whew!-- coming out of the water.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:54.920 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
your journey and what you've

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.080 align:middle line:84%
discovered and where the
hotspot-- and it turns out,

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that area where that
was caught on film

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:05.570 align:middle line:84%
or on tape, that's
one of the hotspots.

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Most sightings of USOs.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And USOs were also
part of the week-long sightings

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.560 align:middle line:90%
for the Nimitz incident in 2004.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit south on
the coast, just off San Diego.

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And so Kevin Day, my friend
from the USS Princeton,

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.730 align:middle line:84%
wants to organize an expedition
to go out there on the ocean

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:26.995 align:middle line:90%
and see what we can find.

00:42:26.995 --> 00:42:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are
you thinking you

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:31.640 align:middle line:90%
might find underground bases?

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: You know, I'm
hoping that we find that--

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's not a smoking
gun if it's underwater.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a bubbling gun.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.450 align:middle line:90%
A squirt gun.

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.350 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a great
scientific exercise

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.170 align:middle line:90%
to go there in general.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the underwater
submersible objects

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.070 align:middle line:84%
really helps show that
these craft are masters

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:59.150 align:middle line:84%
of all they survey, any kind
of medium, whether they're

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.580 align:middle line:84%
appearing and disappearing
in the air, in the water

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:06.410 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, in the ground, just
exhibiting so many capabilities

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.630 align:middle line:84%
beyond our Earthly
technology, day in, day out.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:11.890 align:middle line:90%
And so tell us about--

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:16.820 align:middle line:84%
give us a teaser about some
of the USO type of experiences

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that have been
caught or reported

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.020 align:middle line:84%
that really fascinated
you to decide to go down

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:90%
that particular rabbit hole.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: So it was
Kevin Day, really,

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that brought me in on a
personal gut level to these.

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Hearing him and
seeing his eyes kind

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of well up, because this is
such an emotional experience

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:34.980 align:middle line:90%
for him.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it, this
is a very strong, confident

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:38.420 align:middle line:90%
man.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.420 align:middle line:84%
But what he's talking
about something like this,

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.243 align:middle line:90%
he has a very human reaction.

00:43:42.243 --> 00:43:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I look
for in sort of the credibility

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:90%
of a witness.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about seeing these
things come out of the water.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine--

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a
regular looking craft.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Sort of this tic-tac craft.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Imagine-- you know, we're used
to seeing things fly around.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.720 align:middle line:90%
We understand flight in the air.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.390 align:middle line:84%
But we're not used to seeing
things come out of the water.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And when a sighting
starts off that way,

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.090 align:middle line:84%
imagine how shocked you'd
be from the very beginning.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And then you have all
the chirping of confirmations

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:17.313 align:middle line:84%
from all the various
people, eyewitnesses

00:44:17.313 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:84%
or through gun
camera footage that

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.295 align:middle line:90%
see the thing at the same time.

00:44:21.295 --> 00:44:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine what
that would be like.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And imagine if you'd
seen that by yourself

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:28.550 align:middle line:90%
and you have no corroboration.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But here you have hundreds
of people at the same time

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and the Navy and the
Pentagon and "The New York

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Times" all de facto
confirming your experience.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that has been brought up

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:46.570 align:middle line:84%
in other interviews was talking
with Maurizio and Paola.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:51.160 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about
what they'd originally

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.100 align:middle line:84%
been told of by a man
named Ray Santelli,

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:59.530 align:middle line:84%
having to do with footage that
he had acquired from the 1940s.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And in it, he said the
most interesting thing

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:06.790 align:middle line:84%
is this footage of at that time
President Truman stepping out

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:11.920 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of black cars at
the site of a UFO retrieval

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.113 align:middle line:90%
operation.

00:45:13.113 --> 00:45:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And that there were beings
there-- they might have--

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.905 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they were lying
on the ground or alive or dead,

00:45:17.905 --> 00:45:19.160 align:middle line:90%
but they were there.

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.230 align:middle line:90%
And with this craft.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So talking about
government knowledge of.

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm going to do
is extend that question to,

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.260 align:middle line:84%
do you feel or did your dad
feel there was government

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:39.240 align:middle line:84%
collaboration or participation
with extraterrestrial species,

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.660 align:middle line:90%
as has been said by some others?

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: It's a
really good question.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.430 align:middle line:84%
By definition,
there's multitudes

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:52.208 align:middle line:84%
of evidence of
government cover-up,

00:45:52.208 --> 00:45:54.000 align:middle line:84%
just from documents
that have been released

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.375 align:middle line:84%
in the Freedom of
Information Act

00:45:55.375 --> 00:45:56.940 align:middle line:90%
to write whole pages redacted.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's just agree that
there is a cover-up.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:08.940 align:middle line:84%
How far that extends and to
presidents or military upfront

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.760 align:middle line:84%
encounters with
aliens, I don't know.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of credible
people, including

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.860 align:middle line:84%
this video, which I've not
seen that you're mentioning,

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.910 align:middle line:90%
that sort of indicates that.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:22.630 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not personally
aware of these.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder, because
I think Disclosure

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:29.670 align:middle line:84%
was one of the incidences
where I first--

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:30.720 align:middle line:90%
I was at Disclosure.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I was in DC at the Press
Club, National Press Club.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.503 align:middle line:84%
And I met all these
people in the military,

00:46:37.503 --> 00:46:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and I talked to the
various individuals.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:40.380 align:middle line:90%
This is now, what?

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Almost 20 years ago.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Almost 20 years ago.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And the notion that higher-ups
in the military and that

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.240 align:middle line:84%
presidents themselves had been
informed throughout history--

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly the last six
decades or so about the events.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Seven decades now, eight
decades about these events.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:46:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And that one of the--

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I have been told that one of the
prime questions that presidents

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.250 align:middle line:84%
have when they enter office is,
so when do I get to have access

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:12.980 align:middle line:90%
to this kind of information?

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Is there extraterrestrial life?

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I've read about this and that.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: Yeah, I think both
Hillary and Bill have said that

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.400 align:middle line:90%
on the late night shows.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They have said that.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.855 align:middle line:84%
Apparently Carter was said
to have asked the same thing.

00:47:22.855 --> 00:47:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And he said
that he saw a UFO.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
saw a UFO himself.

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.810 align:middle line:90%
But when it came time--

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I think George W. Bush Sr. was
the head of CIA at that time--

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.950 align:middle line:90%
he was denied access.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:37.843 align:middle line:84%
They are not of a sufficient
level of clearance--

00:47:37.843 --> 00:47:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: They're
temporary placeholders.

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:40.802 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're placeholders.

00:47:40.802 --> 00:47:42.020 align:middle line:90%
They don't get the skinny.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.430 align:middle line:84%
The leaders of this world
don't get the skinny.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.860 align:middle line:84%
It's this tightly
held information

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.610 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the military.

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:53.015 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: If you are MKUltra
or whatever this group is,

00:47:53.015 --> 00:47:55.390 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to give that
information to somebody who

00:47:55.390 --> 00:48:00.450 align:middle line:84%
was elected politically who will
have a quite different agenda

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:04.020 align:middle line:84%
about disclosure, and it may
be a short-term objective, when

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:07.470 align:middle line:84%
you've been working with
us maybe 40, 50 years.

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And so now you're talking
about the real bedfellows

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:15.000 align:middle line:84%
at the very top strata
of military, top strata

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.570 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence, and
top strata of business,

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:21.430 align:middle line:90%
the military industrial complex.

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Those industries
work hand-in-hand

00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:24.940 align:middle line:90%
with the other two.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:25.857 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:48:25.857 --> 00:48:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we as human
beings and presidents

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.060 align:middle line:84%
are not on a need-to-know
basis about this.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And then we see sort
of glimpses of indications

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.510 align:middle line:84%
of that with the
famous 1952 UFO flap

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.280 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, DC,
which is featured

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.500 align:middle line:84%
in the 10th episode of
season one of "Project Blue

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Book" where Truman
in reality scrambled

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:48.450 align:middle line:84%
fighter jets for the UFOs flying
above our nation's capital.

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: Now you know, Truman
was, as they derisively called,

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:54.430 align:middle line:90%
a dirt farmer from Missouri.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: I need to see
it to believe it, right?

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:57.780 align:middle line:90%
The Show-Me state.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.140 align:middle line:84%
You know he's not going to fly
off the handle and scramble

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.800 align:middle line:84%
jets when he knows that he'd
get pilloried in the press

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.540 align:middle line:84%
unless there's
something really there.

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So I have always
found it interesting

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.372 align:middle line:90%
that even as president, no.

00:49:12.372 --> 00:49:13.830 align:middle line:84%
You're not on a
need-to-know basis.

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Now just really quickly, you
had a cameo in one of the shows.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yes.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us who
you were, where you

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:20.860 align:middle line:90%
were, where we will see you.

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: OK.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is episode
six of season two.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Season two.

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And this is the
episode about the movie "Close

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.320 align:middle line:90%
Encounters."

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So they do a flash
forward from the '50s

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.900 align:middle line:84%
to the '70s to the set
of "Close Encounters,"

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and they age my
TV mom and TV dad.

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there for the third time
on the set, and they say, OK.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:41.790 align:middle line:90%
We're going put you in this.

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So I have a cameo role in
the show about my father

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:50.310 align:middle line:84%
in the episode about the
movie based on my father's

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.830 align:middle line:90%
work in which he had a cameo.

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And my cameo is
the very last shot

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.510 align:middle line:84%
of the episode
where TV mom and TV

00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:59.850 align:middle line:84%
dad are walking to
the camera, and you

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.880 align:middle line:84%
see this roguishly
handsome guy sitting

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.180 align:middle line:84%
in a crane as a cameraman, being
lifted up towards the ceiling.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I saw it.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And I think I really
nailed it, the way I sat there.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.920 align:middle line:84%
I really pulled that
whole scene together.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You pulled it.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:16.190 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have
worked without you.

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thank you so much.

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:18.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:20.610 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So I really appreciate your
giving us this backstory,

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:25.228 align:middle line:84%
because so many
people watching this

00:50:25.228 --> 00:50:27.020 align:middle line:84%
are going to take it
up with their families

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and go on this raucous, wild,
wonderful, but also truthful

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:30.740 align:middle line:90%
adventure.

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And you know, everybody
involved with the production--

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:36.620 align:middle line:84%
the actors, the
showrunner, the creator,

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.990 align:middle line:84%
the former network
executive of the show--

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:41.560 align:middle line:90%
are all huge UFO buffs.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And they want
people to understand

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:45.870 align:middle line:90%
there's something going on.

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And they want to shine
a brighter light on this

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and bring people along
not only for the drama,

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.360 align:middle line:84%
but they want
people to say, wow.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.920 align:middle line:84%
There really is
something to this.

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: So the show
comes from a place,

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I've said, of
authenticity and trying

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.110 align:middle line:84%
to wrap it in drama to
get as many people to say,

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:04.670 align:middle line:90%
this is really timely.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.200 align:middle line:84%
The real Project
Blue Book is really

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.990 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
instances of fake news,

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:11.270 align:middle line:84%
because this is propaganda
exercise saying,

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.670 align:middle line:90%
don't look over here.

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:14.320 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
going on over here.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.652 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, we're
left with one question.

00:51:18.652 --> 00:51:19.610 align:middle line:90%
This is a big question.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask this and then find
out besides your USO project--

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.910 align:middle line:84%
fascinating-- what are you
going to use technologically?

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to use submarines
or what to get down there

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:29.403 align:middle line:90%
and find out if there are bases?

00:51:29.403 --> 00:51:32.360 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to tell
us just yet, but that's OK.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.205 align:middle line:90%
You guys are going to go for it.

00:51:35.205 --> 00:51:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and see if there are
underground bases.

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: That's right.

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't wait to
hear the outcome of that.

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:41.030 align:middle line:84%
What other projects--
you have a couple others

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:42.140 align:middle line:84%
you're working on
right now, and then I'm

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.670 align:middle line:84%
going to ask you
the big question.

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: The big question.

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So working on
several different TV

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:51.620 align:middle line:84%
shows in early stages
of production now

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:56.270 align:middle line:84%
that are documentaries,
one of which

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:59.630 align:middle line:84%
will investigate cases that
are really solid cases,

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:02.450 align:middle line:84%
but haven't received as
much attention as others.

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:03.720 align:middle line:90%
And we'd go around the world.

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.680 align:middle line:84%
My brother Joel and I
would go around the world

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and help shine more
light on these cases.

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:11.610 align:middle line:84%
The other shows are
an earlier stage,

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and so I don't know exactly
what they'll be yet.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But one of them is with Kevin
to go and search for the bases.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Can't wait.

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Can't wait.

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Your daddy would be
proud of you too.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: I hope so.

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.560 align:middle line:90%
So this is the big question.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: I'm ready.

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are
they trying to hide?

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.680 align:middle line:84%
We are now-- this was in
the '40s this started.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.633 align:middle line:90%
We're in the 2020s.

00:52:36.633 --> 00:52:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: It's like
the modern era.

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 80 years.

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:43.050 align:middle line:84%
What are they still
trying to hide?

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:45.210 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying
to keep for themselves?

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:48.840 align:middle line:84%
What are they not giving
credit to humanity for?

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they just give it
up when most of the world

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:54.140 align:middle line:84%
believes we're not
alone in this universe?

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And when they
finally do give it up

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and they do the
big D Disclosure,

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I think by that time
populations around the world

00:53:02.730 --> 00:53:04.950 align:middle line:84%
will have already
come to the conclusion

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:06.460 align:middle line:90%
that there's something going on.

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And it will be met not with
a shout, but with a yawn.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: OK, finally
you tell us this.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Hey, welcome to the party.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:19.500 align:middle line:84%
There are so many onion layers
to this notion of government

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.382 align:middle line:90%
knowledge and disclosure.

00:53:21.382 --> 00:53:23.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
they're certainly hiding

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.590 align:middle line:84%
is all the things that the
various people involved

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:27.570 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't have been
doing at the time.

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Information
gathering techniques,

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:30.150 align:middle line:90%
very prosaic things.

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:32.350 align:middle line:84%
They're just not used
to disclosing things.

00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:34.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're used to
operating in the shadows.

00:53:34.475 --> 00:53:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Yeah.

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it could be
embarrassing, or just

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:38.670 align:middle line:84%
divulge other
things that are just

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:41.970 align:middle line:84%
general military things that
they don't want to be known.

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:45.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was a
case in the '50s where

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.790 align:middle line:84%
a woman saw something
in Alaska that she

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:49.410 align:middle line:90%
wasn't supposed to see.

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It was an American military
satellite, or actually

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.230 align:middle line:90%
a high-tech weather balloon.

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:57.030 align:middle line:84%
This was actually
a weather balloon.

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:58.650 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't supposed to see it.

00:53:58.650 --> 00:53:59.910 align:middle line:90%
She reported it.

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the Air
Force actually said

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.140 align:middle line:84%
it was unidentified
because they didn't

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.050 align:middle line:84%
want to tip the Russians
to what we actually have.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I. See.

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.608 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: So it's a
really interesting bit

00:54:09.608 --> 00:54:10.940 align:middle line:90%
of disinformation.

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Now if they have these
really juicy secrets,

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.750 align:middle line:84%
which they may well
have, think about it

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:20.280 align:middle line:90%
from their point of view.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.108 align:middle line:84%
They may have reverse
engineered some

00:54:22.108 --> 00:54:23.400 align:middle line:90%
of the propulsion technologies.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.692 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and this is
what Philip Corso's book is

00:54:25.692 --> 00:54:27.960 align:middle line:84%
about really is
back engineering,

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.105 align:middle line:84%
various types of technology
from fiber optics on.

00:54:31.105 --> 00:54:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HYNEK: And if
you do this, it's

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.590 align:middle line:84%
kind of like artificial
intelligence.

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:37.860 align:middle line:84%
If you get a qualitative step
ahead in one of these areas,

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.830 align:middle line:84%
it's game over for
military superiority.

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's a natural
inclination not

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:45.280 align:middle line:90%
to release anything to anybody.

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.270 align:middle line:84%
But a growing number
of people feel--

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Richard Dolan, Stephen
Bassett, and others--

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:56.150 align:middle line:84%
they feel that they can't
keep it secret much longer,

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:57.660 align:middle line:90%
that they just can't continue.

00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:59.272 align:middle line:90%
Secrets are hard to keep, right?

00:54:59.272 --> 00:55:00.480 align:middle line:90%
And if you look at the Navy--

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cat's out of the bag.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HYNEK: Right.

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And also, we tend to think
of the government as this one

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:06.790 align:middle line:84%
monolithic block,
working in concert.

00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:08.560 align:middle line:90%
There are warring fiefdoms.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It's like "Game of Thrones."

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy, I don't
think-- you know,

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:15.702 align:middle line:84%
they obviously see things very
differently than the Air Force.

00:55:15.702 --> 00:55:17.410 align:middle line:84%
The Navy has its own
agenda, and then you

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:19.930 align:middle line:84%
can have different people in
different parts of the Navy

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:21.440 align:middle line:90%
who see things differently.

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think what
could be happening

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:27.210 align:middle line:84%
is that you have the Navy
now and the avant garde,

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:29.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, the spearhead,
and sort of saying,

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.900 align:middle line:84%
we need to make
these things known.

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And other parts of the
government understanding

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that they can't keep it
secret, so maybe they

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:38.620 align:middle line:84%
are sort of priming
the pump and trying

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:41.260 align:middle line:84%
to control the narrative maybe
with some hidden editorial

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:44.980 align:middle line:84%
schedule for this sort of
drip, drip, drop, drop, drop

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:48.460 align:middle line:84%
of steady state of
divulging, let's say,

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:90%
to say away from disclosure.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Divulging more and more
information to get us ready.

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly seems
consistent with an acceleration

00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:02.530 align:middle line:84%
of the frequency of divulging,
and also sort of the severity

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:06.430 align:middle line:84%
or the seriousness of
what is being divulged.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So it seems consistent with
the government feeling, hey,

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.960 align:middle line:90%
these secrets can't be held.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some people have told
them that upon their death,

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:18.290 align:middle line:84%
their estates will
reveal the secrets.

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:22.348 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like we are living
in a time where more and more--

00:56:22.348 --> 00:56:24.640 align:middle line:84%
we are living in a time where
more and more information

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.510 align:middle line:90%
is coming out.

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's really hard to
see that in isolation

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.400 align:middle line:84%
short of some kind
of grander strategy

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:38.870 align:middle line:84%
or reluctant acknowledgment that
the information will come out,

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and there may be advantage in
who discloses that and when.

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
that is probably true.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And still, I look
at it and think,

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.820 align:middle line:84%
is there truth to the
stories like Balfour?

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Are there truth to the stories
where other species have

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:55.600 align:middle line:84%
been collaborating
with our military

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and our military
industrial complex?

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
they've been collaborating

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.080 align:middle line:90%
on things such as AI?

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And to what extent are they
going to keep that secret?

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And can that actually
not be used in the favor

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.290 align:middle line:90%
of the average person?

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:09.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the area--

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:11.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't like shadows.

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:13.535 align:middle line:84%
I like transparency,
because if you're

00:57:13.535 --> 00:57:15.160 align:middle line:84%
going to develop this
stuff, you better

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.133 align:middle line:84%
be very clear why
you're doing it,

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:18.550 align:middle line:84%
what the higher
purpose for it is,

00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:19.900 align:middle line:90%
and how it's going to be used.

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And who your partners
have been, and where

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:22.780 align:middle line:90%
you got this technology.

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.970 align:middle line:10%
>>HYNEK: And if we have
had these interactions

00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:28.390 align:middle line:10%
with other species,
we are then likely

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:31.030 align:middle line:10%
not completely in
control of what

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:32.950 align:middle line:10%
and when things are disclosed.

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:36.700 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I just want
to say, good luck.

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to
hear about the USOs.

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Please come back once you
discover what you discover,

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and I wish you the best on
that and the other productions.

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And I hope "Project
Blue Book" is picked up

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:50.890 align:middle line:84%
by another network,
because I'm absolutely

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:52.068 align:middle line:90%
loving the heck out of it.

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:53.860 align:middle line:84%
