00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.217 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.800 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Some people believe

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.450 align:middle line:10%
that we should leave
the past alone,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.840 align:middle line:10%
while others think there's
no more worthy study.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.790 align:middle line:10%
Whether it be classical history
or history of a more personal

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:10%
kind, our past can lay a more
sensible context for our lives

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:10%
if we're willing to dig a bit.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bruce Goldberg has
taken thousands of people

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:84%
into their deep
past via hypnosis,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and has found a rich and complex
history to the human race.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:84%
In this conversation,
we're going

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:84%
to touch on some key points
in the human experience--

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, Atlantis, and Lemuria--
and how those societies were

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:84%
influenced by time
travelers from the future.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:90%
And welcome back.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUCE GOLDBERG: Thank you.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our last
conversation was a wild ride.

00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:55.410 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely wonderful.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.621 align:middle line:90%
This is the stuff I live for.

00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's a pleasure to
reincarnate with you, Regina.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's start
out and lay a platform

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of this
information has

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:84%
come through people who you
have taken back into time

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and taken forward into time
through progression therapy.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the basic tenet

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:84%
of what has to happen to
be able for us to hook up

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:84%
with, to connect with,
our super-conscious,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:90%
our higher self.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.435 align:middle line:84%
And then, thus, access
these other timelines.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, we're
dealing with-- first,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:10%
hypnosis is a natural
daydream state

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:10%
that we go through for four
hours during the waking

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.970 align:middle line:10%
day and three hours at
night when we dream.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:10%
Driving on the freeway, not
remembering all the exits

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.702 align:middle line:10%
you pass by as you go to
and from home to office.

00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Subconscious
doing the driving.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, your
subconscious is active.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.274 align:middle line:84%
And the defense mechanism
of the ego is put aside.

00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:84%
That's what hypnosis is,
it's a natural state.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:90%
We need it for life.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So absolutely we
have to go through.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly safe.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So we do that for
seven hours a day.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're dealing
with the subconscious

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:84%
mind with hypnosis,
so my approach here

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.520 align:middle line:84%
is in addition to having a
subconscious, which is actually

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:84%
quite imperfect-- people
have problems-- you also

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:84%
have your adviser, the
perfect part of your soul,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:90%
which is called the higher self.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
The technical term is
super-consciousness mind.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Plato named that
2,300 years ago.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.855 align:middle line:84%
Now, in connecting the
subconscious to the higher

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
self, there is a rule of
thumb, a universal law that

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:84%
says you can never
lower the soul's energy.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So the higher self is never
going to be compromised.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But because you're exposed
to a higher form of energy,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
you can now raise the energy of
the subconscious mind or soul.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, grow spiritually.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
the higher self

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
is your gatekeeper
or your librarian

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:90%
to the akashic records.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It's how you get past and
future life information,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:90%
or about parallel lives.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I call that para-regression,
interestingly enough.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So the higher self is what
you want to hook up into.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Anybody gets any spiritual
or any psychic information,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
the higher self is
always relevant.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So the question is the more you
connect with the higher self,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:84%
the more you're going to
have these experiences

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and the more you're
going to benefit by them.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
have to say you do

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful job in your
books of giving really

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
hands-on information as to how
people can begin doing that.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
all have access to you,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
but people can begin
doing this by themselves.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Each of the books
has dozens of exercises.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:10%
And of course, my
home page website

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:10%
has access to CDs and
other things they can do.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.260 align:middle line:10%
But remember, all
hypnosis is self-hypnosis.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.420 align:middle line:10%
And I represent-- two
words, psychic empowerment.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.721 align:middle line:90%
The opposite of co-dependency.

00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people to be
co-dependent on me or anyone

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.754 align:middle line:84%
So I want people to take
charge of their life,

00:03:23.754 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
this is all about.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when they're
with you personally,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:84%
you're just serving
as a facilitator

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:90%
for their own self-hypnosis.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I like
to think of myself

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.958 align:middle line:84%
as the social director
on the karma cruise ship.

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:32.916 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I'm introducing
the subconscious

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:90%
to the higher self.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.948 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of misunderstandings

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
as you've just
touched on briefly.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
misunderstandings

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.890 align:middle line:90%
about hypnosis.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The reality is people hear
about stories such as Manchurian

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Candidates, MKUltra
mind ops projects.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
This is a degree of
abuse and exploitation

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that moves far
beyond any hypnosis.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Let's clarify.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Number one, hypnosis
is not dangerous.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:90%
We do it for--

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --seven hours
a day or else we die.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.051 align:middle line:84%
Number two, it's
not brainwashing.

00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
MKUltra for a moment,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:90%
or the brain-washing techniques.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Manchurian candidates
is example.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, you
have to deny the person sleep

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:90%
for three weeks.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.656 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:11.197 align:middle line:90%
It's torture.

00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Give them
hallucinogenic drugs.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.446 align:middle line:84%
General anesthetics at least,
if not hallucinogenic drugs,

00:04:15.446 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:90%
and then do hypnosis.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Hypnosis by itself may
help them stop smoking,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.384 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going
to brainwash them.

00:04:21.384 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is very different
than-- I'm just stating this.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.380 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, this is
very different than hypnosis.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, in fact, this
is going totally tangential,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
but it was such a sad,
sad thing to listen to.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a recording that
still exists of Sirhan Sirhan.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
He was taken into hypnosis by a
well-known person at the time--

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Southern California--
to start digging

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
into what was his
motivation for doing this.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing in the memory.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he kept
saying-- he was in tears.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
He said, why would I
have done such a thing?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:84%
It's completely against
my religion, my beliefs,

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:90%
and who I am.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So it shows how
deeply these torture

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
techniques, which are not to
be confused with hypnosis,

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.924 align:middle line:90%
can be utilized for ill-purpose.

00:05:05.924 --> 00:05:08.548 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: By the way, the best
hypnotist in the United States

00:05:08.548 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:90%
is Madison Avenue.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boy, is it.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.414 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But
here's the thing.

00:05:11.414 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
You can never do anything
you don't normally do.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.020 align:middle line:90%
And I was wondering that.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: For example, I
don't drink any alcohol ever.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:90%
I watch football games.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.265 align:middle line:84%
I see the Swedish Bombardiers
coming down with the Budweiser

00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%
in the deserts.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.385 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean anything to me.

00:05:24.385 --> 00:05:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I like looking
at the women,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:90%
but I don't drink the beer.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:90%
You don't drink the Kool-Aid.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: The Kool-Aid.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.765 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Jim Jones, 1978.

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:32.723 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:05:32.723 --> 00:05:34.385 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going
to put that aside

00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:36.339 align:middle line:84%
that this is a natural
state and a deep--

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: And positive.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.338 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And positive.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:90%
And deep, deep work can be done.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.054 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
the danger is not

00:05:41.054 --> 00:05:42.737 align:middle line:84%
doing it, because
then people wind up

00:05:42.737 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
just living a
brain-dead life and just

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.477 align:middle line:84%
repeating-- remember
what Einstein said.

00:05:46.477 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
If you do the same thing
over and over again

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and you expect
different results,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.156 align:middle line:84%
that's the definition
of insanity.

00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:84%
OK now, people are able
to hook into timelines

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
that are beyond our
third-dimensional reality.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:84%
They can go to the deep
past, but they can also

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:90%
go to the deep future.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And before we get into the
subjects of Egypt, Atlantis,

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and Lemuria, I want to
brooch at this point

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
the subject of parallel
lives, realities,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
universes because this is
going to play into those.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So we're going to
separate two different terms

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.110 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:84%
One is called parallel self
and then parallel life.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, a parallel life represents
an alternate universe.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
I know they've watched
TV shows like "Fringe"

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and some of the feature films,
but parallel universes actually

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:84%
came out of Einstein's
theory of relativity

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.302 align:middle line:84%
in 1957 in Princeton University,
which is the time travel

00:06:36.302 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:84%
university if you
know the history.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.325 align:middle line:84%
Einstein was there,
Edward Witten, and others.

00:06:40.325 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Hugh Everett III got his
PhD in quantum mechanics

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
on the many worlds
phenomena, which

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
established parallel
universes as a reality.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Mathematically-based.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:90%
And nobody has disavowed it yet.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So parallel universes means
that we have sister universes,

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
sister Earths in
infinite number.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.096 align:middle line:90%
Now, the people are the same.

00:07:01.096 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Your genetics are
going to be the same.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:84%
If you were to see
your parallel self,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.026 align:middle line:84%
you would look exact-- you might
be a little heavier or a little

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
thinner depending
on your eating.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.145 align:middle line:90%
But the DNA is the same.

00:07:10.145 --> 00:07:12.635 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
are the events.

00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:90%
So here's an example.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.665 align:middle line:84%
I work with a young
woman, a young teenager.

00:07:15.665 --> 00:07:17.120 align:middle line:90%
I call her Tanya.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And she uses my techniques
which I described

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.066 align:middle line:84%
in my "Custom Design Your
Own Destiny" approach.

00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:84%
She goes back and
she's doing a science

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:90%
project or a project for school.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.146 align:middle line:84%
She has to write a term
paper on the year 1968.

00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:34.645 align:middle line:84%
A very volatile
year in our history.

00:07:34.645 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So she decides
to cheat a little bit

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and use my techniques
to actually go back

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:84%
there and see if
she can view it.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.872 align:middle line:84%
She does a regression, but
she goes back into 1968.

00:07:45.872 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And in 1968, Robert F.
Kennedy was elected president,

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:90%
was not assassinated.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:90%
There was no Watergate.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
We were pulled out
of Vietnam by 1970.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet Union
collapsed by 1986

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and the economic outlook of the
world was really quite bright.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, she was familiar with
my work and she realizes,

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:90%
whoa, this is not my universe.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.150 align:middle line:90%
This is a sister universe.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So she comes back
to the present,

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and then she goes downstairs
to her mother's-- a teenager

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.484 align:middle line:90%
at home school.

00:08:12.484 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Her mother's going to
prepare a snack for her.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And the mother is acting
very differently than the way

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:90%
her mother acts.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So she realized she's still in
the same parallel universe that

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.210 align:middle line:84%
had Robert F.
Kennedy as president.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So she returned again,
started using my tapes again,

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.035 align:middle line:84%
finally got back into
the proper universe.

00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Well then, she finally
sees her mother again.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.695 align:middle line:84%
She goes, where were
you all afternoon?

00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
I was beside myself.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's she going to say?

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:38.877 align:middle line:90%
That was a parallel universe.

00:08:38.877 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, those are
parallel universes.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:90%
They do exist.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:90%
There's an infinite number.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
My research shows there
are five major categories

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and there's an infinite
number under each category.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a terrible
present right now and terrible

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:90%
future, it's only one option.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
You can actually be
trained to switch paths

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.655 align:middle line:90%
into your ideal path.

00:08:55.655 --> 00:08:57.654 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let me
ask you a question here

00:08:57.654 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
because anyone skeptical
will be wondering this.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:84%
What is to say that that
woman and others like

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:84%
her weren't idealizing an
alternative outcome rather

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.742 align:middle line:84%
than experiencing
a parallel reality?

00:09:07.742 --> 00:09:09.825 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, the math
is correct in the sense

00:09:09.825 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:84%
that we know parallel
universes exist

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.630 align:middle line:84%
thanks to Hugh
Everett and Einstein.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Number two is you can't
prove a negative here.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I can't prove that
Robert F. Kennedy was alive.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But any theoretical
physicist will tell you

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.084 align:middle line:84%
that, yeah, every
option is out there.

00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:84%
In parallel
universes, the British

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle line:84%
win the American
Revolutionary War.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.057 align:middle line:84%
And Joshua is
defeated in his battle

00:09:31.057 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
monotheistic religions.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's all kinds
of options out there.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So you can't really
prove that because it's

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.586 align:middle line:84%
a parallel universe and
you can't bring a tape

00:09:38.586 --> 00:09:40.740 align:middle line:84%
recorder with you or
a camera to do it.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.436 align:middle line:84%
But mathematically
and theoretically,

00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:84%
there's no argument
in the field.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.393 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let me
ask you this then,

00:09:45.393 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:84%
is the hallmark of that
kind of experience,

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:84%
as it is-- and I've been
through many regressions, as is

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
regression work going into
deep, deep past for exploration.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:84%
To me, those experiences
are not only as real, maybe

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
even more real than
being in the moment.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.385 align:middle line:84%
Everything is so
clear are visceral.

00:10:03.385 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But you
can't document them.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:90%
If you go back--

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can't.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --20,000
BC, you can't document.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.325 align:middle line:90%
There's the problem.

00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:07.783 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You cannot
document them.

00:10:07.783 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
The point is they have
that kind of crystal

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:90%
clarity and visceral engagement.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Is it the same with
people who report

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:14.944 align:middle line:90%
these parallel realities?

00:10:14.944 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even more extreme
because they can identify.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
You can actually-- let me give
you a case history example.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So we'll deal with
parallel universes.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Here's an example of
a woman I worked with.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:90%
She was from Detroit, Michigan.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And she was having
a terrible life--

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:84%
arguing with her husband,
hated the weather,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:90%
wanted to get out of it.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
move to Florida, OK?

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So she does some progressions
and she finds out

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.020 align:middle line:84%
that if she's on a
certain path, she

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.669 align:middle line:84%
goes five or six
years into the future,

00:10:47.669 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:90%
everything is going to be good.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.461 align:middle line:84%
She's going to be
living in Florida.

00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:52.293 align:middle line:84%
The husband's going to
get a consulting job.

00:10:52.293 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
She's going to
have-- everything's

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:90%
going to be fine, OK?

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Whereas right now,
everything isn't.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:84%
The only problem with
that is that before she

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
moves to Florida, she's downtown
in Detroit doing shopping.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:84%
She gets shot and killed
one Saturday night

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:90%
by a drive-by gang-banger.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So she goes, well,
that's not the future

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:90%
I want to see doctor.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: And I said, OK.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.744 align:middle line:90%
So we do the other options.

00:11:15.744 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now years go by.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.376 align:middle line:90%
She calls me.

00:11:20.376 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's about maybe
eight years later.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said, doctor,
I have to update you.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.146 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:11:25.146 --> 00:11:28.165 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, my husband
and I moved to Florida.

00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:84%
He got his consulting
assignment, et cetera.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
There are certain differencecs
in the future that I

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
was killed, but
obviously I'm alive.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.700 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to know that I
kept in touch with my hometown

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.344 align:middle line:84%
because I'm from Detroit,
and her family's there.

00:11:40.344 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:90%
Parents and stuff are there.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.112 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I used
to get the paper.

00:11:43.112 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And remember that day that
I was supposed to get shot

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.579 align:middle line:84%
and killed in downtown
Detroit on Saturday night?

00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, yeah.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else was
shot and killed

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:90%
at the exact same intersection.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: How's that?

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking--

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
is really indicating

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.735 align:middle line:90%
something that's real.

00:11:57.735 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And in our last
conversation, you

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
talked about another
client of yours who said,

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:84%
doctor, doctor,
what should I do?

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm booked on a flight
for Europe and I saw--

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: TWA Flight 800.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Flight 800
is going to go down.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that event has
already occurred somewhere.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:90%
That event is a reality.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Pre-cognition has to be
tapping into something

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
of an alternative nature and
a reality that exists, right?

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.339 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Think of the
soul as a light beam.

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:21.255 align:middle line:84%
We can split a light
beam by putting an object

00:12:21.255 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:90%
in front of it.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Every parallel
universe has your soul.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.262 align:middle line:84%
And also, access to
your higher self.

00:12:26.262 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:90%
The difference is the events.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody has
an incurable disease,

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
or they've lost an arm, or
they've lost loved ones,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:90%
or they've lost pets.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.942 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
bunch of factors.

00:12:35.942 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
they can do about it.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is something
they can do about it.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.411 align:middle line:84%
They can switch paths
into another universe

00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:90%
where that didn't happen.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I work with.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I call this the
new you technique.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.221 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I've done this.

00:12:46.221 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, I've done this myself.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I did this way back
in the early '90s

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.440 align:middle line:84%
when I was working on
a TV project with CBS

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.784 align:middle line:90%
doing a movie for television.

00:12:53.784 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And the writer said,
you know something?

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.866 align:middle line:84%
I was authorized
to do treatments,

00:12:56.866 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
going to film it.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.256 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'll fix it.

00:13:00.256 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:84%
He says what are
you going to do?

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
to hear from you.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm not going
to contact them directly.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:84%
He goes, oh, you're going to use
one of your weird techniques,

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, all I know is
not just the fact

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that the movie aired on May 17,
1994, "The Search for Grace."

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.310 align:middle line:84%
But many other things
many years in the future

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
from that that
affected me personally

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.430 align:middle line:84%
that I had no control
over also occurred.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:90%
So I switched paths.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.161 align:middle line:84%
I'm not on the path
I was 20 years ago.

00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a different path.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:90%
A very good one, granted.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That's
how I meet you, right?

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:90%
But anyone can do this.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:90%
That's parallel lives.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's separate another
concept which is even stranger.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.140 align:middle line:90%
This is called parallel selves.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Remember we had the soul?

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, the soul is going to
be occupying the same DNA

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:90%
body in parallel universes.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But in the current universe
that we're in right now,

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.310 align:middle line:84%
your current world that
you have around you,

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:84%
your soul can occupy more
than one body at one time.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:84%
These are going to be different
people, different DNA.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a really
hard one for people to take.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I know,
but it's real.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And these are called
parallel selves.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.221 align:middle line:84%
So here's an example
of a case I report

00:13:59.221 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:84%
in my "Exploring the
Fifth Dimension" book

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:90%
of Charles and Winchester.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Charles and Winchester
are two people.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Charles is an academic, five
foot eight, blonde hair,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:90%
wears little glasses.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Very academic-- a Walter Mitty
type, very meek and mild.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.889 align:middle line:90%
He lives on the East Coast.

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Across the country
he's got a cousin.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.500 align:middle line:90%
I call her Jeanine.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't seen her for a while.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, he describes
a par-- he wants

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
to go into the past
lives and future lives.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But instead, he does what
we call a para-regression

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.625 align:middle line:84%
and he describes a man by
the name of Winchester who

00:14:31.625 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:84%
is a red-necky, six
foot five, wears

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.246 align:middle line:90%
plaids, drives a pickup truck.

00:14:36.246 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
not his alter-ego?

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, OK.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.356 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that
he's very embarrassed.

00:14:40.356 --> 00:14:43.647 align:middle line:84%
He says, if this is me, then
I-- I don't want anything

00:14:43.647 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:90%
to do with this guy.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:84%
With all due respect,
we're the opposite.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.895 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, this is
called a para-regression.

00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:50.140 align:middle line:90%
This is a parallel self.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.354 align:middle line:90%
I says, don't worry about it.

00:14:51.354 --> 00:14:53.020 align:middle line:84%
You're probably never
going to meet him.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:53.830 align:middle line:90%
So don't worry about it.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:54.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.036 align:middle line:90%
So he says, all right.

00:14:55.036 --> 00:14:56.802 align:middle line:84%
So now what happens
is a few weeks later,

00:14:56.802 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't tell anybody
about Winchester.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:90%
He's very embarrassed by him.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I'm not going
to tell anyone, obviously.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So now, a couple of weeks later,
Jeanine on the West Coast--

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:90%
she lives in California.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
She's driving home from a
business trip she was on.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.863 align:middle line:84%
Her car gets stuck
in the desert.

00:15:10.863 --> 00:15:14.480 align:middle line:84%
A guy pulls up in a pickup
truck and he says, ma'am,

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:90%
can I help ya?

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.132 align:middle line:90%
And she says, yes.

00:15:17.132 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And I guess her
cellphone wasn't working.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't get help.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:90%
So he says, I can help you.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So he's going to fix the
car and fix the flat tire.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:90%
And he does his thing.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:84%
He's six foot five,
wearing plaid, red hair.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.779 align:middle line:90%
And she says, who do I thank?

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:32.570 align:middle line:90%
How do I thank you?

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:90%
He says, my name is Winchester.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, she also felt very close
to this guy, like she knew him.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This is
Charles' parallel self.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So people can feel
freaky about it.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And we do-- theoretically,
the average person

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.139 align:middle line:84%
is going to have a
million of these.

00:15:48.139 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
But you know they say
that every person has

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:84%
an exact double
somewhere in the world?

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's fine for genetics.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:90%
But this is different.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:90%
This is the soul.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So we do have parallel
selves, and we

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.834 align:middle line:84%
do occupy more than
one body at one time.

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:84%
The reason being is
because we trace our souls

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
back to what we call
common oversouls.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So Winchester and
Charles can trace them

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:84%
back to a common--
we call a subsoul.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:84%
That subsoul can trace
back to another subsoul.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.004 align:middle line:84%
And eventually it goes
back to an oversoul.

00:16:14.004 --> 00:16:16.045 align:middle line:84%
People use this concept
when they meet soulmates.

00:16:16.045 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Twin flames, so to speak.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.010 align:middle line:84%
People from the same
oversoul concept

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that eventually hook
up in a relationship,

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:90%
and it's an ideal relationship.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also in family
and among friends as well.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And I have this exact same
dynamic-- my son Stuart

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and I have the exact same
predilections in life.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I wake up and I'm
in a mood to make a spicy chili

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.904 align:middle line:84%
soup, I'll find out he just
made one that same morning.

00:16:38.904 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:84%
We'll get a speeding
ticket across the country

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:84%
from each other
the same morning.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now
see, mathematically

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:84%
the odds against that happening,
the standard deviation

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.369 align:middle line:84%
and the permutations are
like a zillion to one.

00:16:47.369 --> 00:16:48.076 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:16:48.076 --> 00:16:49.110 align:middle line:90%
I've always wondered.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And numerologically,
we match up in that

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:84%
we're in the exact same day
cycle our entire lifetimes,

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:90%
both of our lifetimes.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's pretty
freaky when you're

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.810 align:middle line:84%
getting down to actual--
even down to certain thoughts

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:90%
that we're having and plans.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:84%
And I've always wondered,
what's up with that?

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: To me, that would
be very red flag or classical

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.972 align:middle line:90%
of a parallel self experience.

00:17:10.972 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't prove it.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:90%
You can't prove these.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to
have to go meditate on that

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:14.380 align:middle line:90%
and think about it.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk to
him about it, too.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:90%
Let him meditate about it.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But the
point is, is that

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.089 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit
of the universe--

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
remember, as we go along in our
civilization and development

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.349 align:middle line:84%
technologically, eventually
there's a classification

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:84%
called a type
three civilization,

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.855 align:middle line:84%
which is about 2,500
years in the future.

00:17:29.855 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:84%
That means we're
going to harness

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:90%
the energy of the entire galaxy.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we do that,
parallel universes

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:90%
are going to be a given.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Time travel is
going to be a given.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.918 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So let's say the
Earth is going to be exploding

00:17:39.918 --> 00:17:42.675 align:middle line:84%
or it's going to be devoid
of our raw materials.

00:17:42.675 --> 00:17:43.800 align:middle line:90%
We have to get out of here.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.508 align:middle line:84%
We have to terraform
and get out of here.

00:17:45.508 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's too late.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Or the universe
that we're living in

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.773 align:middle line:90%
is going to have a real problem.

00:17:48.773 --> 00:17:50.025 align:middle line:90%
Black holes, whatever.

00:17:50.025 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:84%
By that time-- our
humans, we will

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.110 align:middle line:84%
be able to go right into
the parallel universes

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and go across the galaxy
or go into a completely

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.317 align:middle line:84%
different mentality
dimensionally.

00:18:00.317 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Parallel universes are
the fifth dimension--

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.380 align:middle line:84%
where we would avoid all
the problems that occur.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Just like right now, my parallel
life in 1995-- 6, 7, or 8

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and the universe that I left,
things could be good or bad.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.400 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing to do with it.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.610 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't affect me at all.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.190 align:middle line:84%
One has nothing to
do with the other.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So they're very separate
but equal as we say.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this also starts
getting into the realm--

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.487 align:middle line:84%
so I assume that the oversoul
just gives itself perpetually

00:18:26.487 --> 00:18:27.195 align:middle line:90%
more experience--

00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:27.993 align:middle line:90%
That's how you learn.

00:18:27.993 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to gather and
come back and bring back

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
into the highest aspect
of self by doing this.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's like
franchising yourself.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like
franchising yourself.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, this gets into
the long-held question

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:84%
which is, how, if there
are only so many souls,

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.669 align:middle line:84%
do you have an exploding
population on this planet?

00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
many, many people have asked.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:84%
You're saying the oversoul
notion answers that?

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.213 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you have to
understand there are no virgin

00:18:52.213 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:84%
souls, which means that every
soul that's-- there's 7-plus

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.980 align:middle line:90%
billion people on the Earth.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.054 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those souls--
they're occupying a human body.

00:19:00.054 --> 00:19:00.970 align:middle line:90%
But look at the souls.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.030 align:middle line:90%
You trace them back.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.390 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find
they had past lives.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.090 align:middle line:84%
The average person
out there has had

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:90%
at least a thousand past lives.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:90%
They don't remember them.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.310 align:middle line:84%
They're not gong to get
those regressed because who's

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
going to do a
thousand regressions?

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
then we're talking

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:90%
about parallel universes, too.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how do you explain
the world's population?

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.252 align:middle line:84%
They say, what--
2,000 years ago there

00:19:16.252 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
might have been 20 million
people on the Earth.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Now there's 7 billion.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:84%
If you take one oversoul and
you split it three times so

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.120 align:middle line:84%
it occupies three
different bodies,

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:90%
so it can learn more lessons.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And then each of those
three occupy three more.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:84%
This is called a
geometric progression.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So 1 becomes 3, becomes
9, becomes-- eventually,

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:84%
After 13 generations,
one oversoul

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
will occupy over
1.5 million bodies.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not difficult to get
7 billion in 2,000 years

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%
from 20 million, or whatever
the population was then.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's how we explain it.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And remember, this also fits
into the parallel selves.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It also fits in to the
concepts of soul mates.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Again, we're all mutts.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:90%
There's no pure--

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.468 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, maybe that
also falls into the notion

00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:84%
that now so many people you
meet, it's like, I know you.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Jeez, where do I know you from?

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.082 align:middle line:84%
It's like you've already
met almost everybody

00:20:08.082 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:84%
that you come in any kind
of personal contact--

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:10.525 align:middle line:90%
real personal contact.

00:20:10.525 --> 00:20:11.676 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, you may have
met them in the past, though.

00:20:11.676 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:84%
You may have met
them in past lives.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Either way.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Or you
may have met them just

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.680 align:middle line:84%
from this genetic
little paradigm.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.702 align:middle line:84%
But everything's seeming
very familiar now.

00:20:17.702 --> 00:20:18.451 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, statistically, it's
very odd for that to happen.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Because of 7 billion
people on the Earth,

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.545 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't identify
with anyone, actually,

00:20:24.545 --> 00:20:25.920 align:middle line:90%
when you think of it.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:90%
The numbers are too great.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's take all
this, this portrait

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:84%
that we have now painted,
and we'll take a soul back.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And I want to start having
you reflect back to us

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:84%
what your clients, your hypnosis
clients, in their regressions

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.320 align:middle line:90%
have experienced.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
Lemurian times first.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Talk about it in terms
of the continent,

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
the location, the nature
of the life, the beings,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.045 align:middle line:90%
and case histories.

00:20:51.045 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.794 align:middle line:84%
First, you have to understand,
5 million years ago,

00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:84%
the Aliran ET group came to this
planet, and they were nasty.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to take over
the planet and this and that.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So if it wasn't for the
Syrians, another ET group--

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.700 align:middle line:90%
they were our protectors.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of fights
going on, going on, going on.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Now eventually, Lemuria
is about 200,000 BC.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria was almost
like a perfect society.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:90%
They were very spiritual.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.020 align:middle line:84%
The basic group is
called the Aseens,

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.884 align:middle line:84%
that actually were genetically
related to the Syrians.

00:21:21.884 --> 00:21:23.425 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was a
lot of interbreeding

00:21:23.425 --> 00:21:24.622 align:middle line:90%
involved with the ETs.

00:21:24.622 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
The Alirians and
Syrians interbred.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.205 align:middle line:90%
They interbred with humans.

00:21:27.205 --> 00:21:29.029 align:middle line:84%
So remember, it's
a big mush here.

00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But let's just go
with the Lemurians.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:90%
So 200,000 BC.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
They're the only civilized or
major technologically-advanced

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:90%
society on the planet.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And they decided about 100,000
years into their civilizations,

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:46.052 align:middle line:84%
now 100,000 BC, they decide
to expand their colony,

00:21:46.052 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, to
establish colonies.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Their main colony was Atlantis
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:90%
Lemuria was in the Pacific.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.610 align:middle line:84%
A very large continent, 3,000
miles across, 64 million

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.420 align:middle line:90%
inhabitants.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Where Hawaii right
now is the center

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:84%
of where Lemuria was if you
look at it from point of view.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:04.299 align:middle line:84%
So Atlantis was established
by-- the main people

00:22:04.299 --> 00:22:05.340 align:middle line:90%
there were the Atlantees.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Atlantees were
different than the Aseens.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantees were more
lyran in their mentality--

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:90%
militaristic, greedy, selfish.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were spiritual,
but they had problems.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So Atlantis was established
as the main colony,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and then they had-- they
were OK for a while,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:84%
but then all of a
sudden, Atlantis

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:90%
started getting greedy.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And they started warring,
committing war on Lemuria.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Rama
Empire of Ancient India.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.980 align:middle line:90%
India was another major colony.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You had the
Rama Empire, 25,000 BC.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.895 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear wars-- the
Mahabarata, the epic poem

00:22:37.895 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
from the East Indians, it's part
of their religious scriptures.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.710 align:middle line:84%
They talk about the elephants
vaporizing and the sonic booms.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
These are all nuclear
explosions that they should not

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:90%
know about.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:90%
They also had aircrafts.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:84%
They had the manas
of the Indians.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And they had the valix
of the Atlanteans.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So you had nuclear wars
that were depicted.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So what they also did-- so
Atlantis and Lemuria competed

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:90%
over Egypt.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:90%
This is very interesting.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
saying at this point

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.810 align:middle line:84%
that Lemuria and Atlantis, or
the early stages of Atlantis,

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:16.574 align:middle line:90%
were concurrent?

00:23:16.574 --> 00:23:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:17.847 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:23:17.847 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now,
Lemuria was first.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
But by 100,000 BC,
you now have Atlantis.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.054 align:middle line:90%
So they overlapped?

00:23:23.054 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: They overlapped.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:84%
You don't have your first
cataclysms until about 50,000

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.110 align:middle line:84%
BC when they both went down for
the first time, at least parts

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.702 align:middle line:84%
And then, the second one
was 26,000 BC, give or take.

00:23:33.702 --> 00:23:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And then the third one, the
last one where they sunk,

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:90%
period, was about 11,000 BC.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking
about before that.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it comes
to Egypt now, they

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
decided around 30,000
or so BC-- this

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:90%
was after the first cataclysm.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:84%
They decided to set
up a colony in Egypt.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to use that
as their real primer colony.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.796 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
the northern part,

00:23:57.796 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:84%
which is called Lower Egypt,
because the Nile flows

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:90%
from South to North.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.830 align:middle line:90%
So Lower Egypt is Cairo today.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:90%
That was settled by Atlantis.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
The southern part, which
is called Upper Egypt

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.602 align:middle line:84%
by Egyptologists--
of course, the Nile

00:24:08.602 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:84%
is where the base
of it is-- that was

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:90%
settled by the Lemurians.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So what you had was two
completely different societies

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:15.480 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to get
into how that expressed itself.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But I want to go
back for a moment

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and talk about the people
that are going back

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.334 align:middle line:84%
into the Lemurian
times, and then we'll

00:24:25.334 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:84%
follow this whole thread that
you've just nicely laid out.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.085 align:middle line:84%
What was life like in
the Lemurian times?

00:24:30.085 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.350 align:middle line:84%
They had temples of
wisdom where they

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:84%
were very scholarly and
teaching spiritual techniques.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Their basic religion
was reincarnation.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.030 align:middle line:84%
There was a
monotheistic religion.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.820 align:middle line:84%
They had temples of healing
where they could heal people

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.350 align:middle line:84%
by energy, crystal healing,
which Atlantis eventually

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:90%
copied.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:90%
People were just walking around.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.435 align:middle line:84%
They looked like
spiritual beings

00:24:49.435 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:90%
walking around with togas.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:90%
They had animal life there.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a large continent,
the size of the United States.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:90%
But beautiful rivers.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.141 align:middle line:84%
And their architecture,
their masons

00:24:58.141 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
were brilliant in the
way they constructed

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:84%
their temples,
beautiful temples.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.882 align:middle line:84%
And people had a
really good life.

00:25:03.882 --> 00:25:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And they could do
what they wanted.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.342 align:middle line:90%
There was no real crime, per se.

00:25:07.342 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was before
the warring factions?

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This is
before 100,000 BC.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a
lot of people had

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:90%
their abilities still intact.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Psychic abilities.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Psychic abilities.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.885 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yeah.

00:25:16.885 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:90%
They were empaths.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.660 align:middle line:90%
They were psychic.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Telepathic communication
was a given there.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.917 align:middle line:90%
Very healthy.

00:25:22.917 --> 00:25:23.625 align:middle line:90%
They lived long--

00:25:23.625 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Long lives.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: --periods of time.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Long lives, OK?

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
a pretty ideal society.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, where does the
genetic engineering come in

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.694 align:middle line:90%
from what you have seen?

00:25:33.694 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: OK, well
remember, Lemurians

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:90%
are also genetically interacted.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
To form them, you also had
the Syrians, and the Leerans,

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:90%
and who knows what else?

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.950 align:middle line:84%
There's about 300 ET groups
that have been on this planet.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So we know there's
a big mush here.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.240 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, the
Syrians were more dominant

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:84%
because they were
far more spiritual.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Syrians
were symbolized

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.592 align:middle line:90%
by the dogs and the serpents.

00:25:55.592 --> 00:25:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the Dogon
tribe still honors them, yes.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And the
Dogon tribe, right.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they observed
the moons, et cetera.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:26:00.575 --> 00:26:01.175 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That the
astronomers didn't

00:26:01.175 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:84%
know until many
hundreds of years later.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:07.100 align:middle line:10%
The Leerans were
more experienced

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:10%
with the cats and the
birds, like the idea

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:10%
of the Phoenix, the ancient
bird that dies and rises

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.519 align:middle line:10%
from its ashes every 500 years,
the symbol of reincarnation.

00:26:14.519 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:10%
That's a Leeran symbol,
interesting enough.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And there were
massive birds back then.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, there were.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.072 align:middle line:90%
And very large birds.

00:26:20.072 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, massive.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They were like
8 feet tall and eating us.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.230 align:middle line:90%
They had red hair, too.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were a very
violent species.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.420 align:middle line:84%
They eventually gave rise
more to the Atlantees

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.670 align:middle line:84%
because they were greedy and
selfish and militaristic.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:38.052 align:middle line:84%
We always associate Atlantis
with very-- like Ancient Rome.

00:26:38.052 --> 00:26:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Very militaristic,
very hard-nosed.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Although, they had a
spiritual component too.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was also
a very ideal side as well.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They also
had parts that are ideal,

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.380 align:middle line:84%
but they had the
military component.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.060 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like watching
a "Planet of the Apes"

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.518 align:middle line:84%
where the gorillas
are the bad guys

00:26:48.518 --> 00:26:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and the chimpanzees
are the spiritual ones.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, the
Atlantees dominated.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
actually declared war

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.070 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
like the Lemurians being

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual leaders and they
were jealous of their power,

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and their land, and
everything else they had.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So the Atlantees settled in
the Mayan civilization, more

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Western hemisphere,
as well of course, Egypt,

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.710 align:middle line:90%
the northern part of Egypt.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:84%
The Lemurians were
more into India,

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and parts of South America,
and the various-- Australian,

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.320 align:middle line:84%
the Aborigines, those
were Lemurians bases.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So basically you had the
wars that would exist.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the biggest one
was, of course, in Egypt.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Because now there was a
vying for power in Egypt.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And Egypt had two major
components, the northern part,

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.360 align:middle line:84%
which was Atlantean,
the southern part, which

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:90%
was Lemurian.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you had time
travelers from our future,

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.340 align:middle line:84%
chrononauts that we discussed
a little bit last time.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:84%
They actually came in and
actually made the peace.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:90%
So this is what happens.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.450 align:middle line:84%
The man who developed time
travel was a man named Taatos,

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:90%
that's T-A-A-T--

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the future?

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.223 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: In the future.

00:27:52.223 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:90%
3050 AD, 31st century.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:84%
T-A-A-T-O-S is how
you spell Taatos.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.476 align:middle line:90%
So he has a team.

00:27:58.476 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:84%
The government approves
him, of course.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.015 align:middle line:84%
He's doing research
for the government.

00:28:01.015 --> 00:28:03.320 align:middle line:84%
He says, OK, you've
got this time travel.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:84%
How did we first
establish time travel?

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.801 align:middle line:84%
First, they send back
holograms into the past.

00:28:07.801 --> 00:28:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Remember the Greek oracles, how
they'd read these holograms?

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.674 align:middle line:84%
That was time-traveler
mentality.

00:28:11.674 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Then they sent small objects
back and small animals.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
Taatos and his team.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.690 align:middle line:90%
So what did his team consist of?

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Geb, Horace, Osiris and Isis.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Those are all Egyptian
gods, as well as Taatos.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Taatos was Thoth, actually.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.410 align:middle line:84%
He's pictured as Thoth
or Hermes by the Greeks.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.390 align:middle line:90%
That's Taatos.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.521 align:middle line:84%
Because he was a brilliant guy,
like the Da Vinci of his time.

00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:34.770 align:middle line:84%
They go back into Egypt and
they establish themselves.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.304 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they're going
to be Egyptian gods,

00:28:37.304 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:90%
they're coming in in crafts.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:39.600 align:middle line:90%
They're teleporting.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.160 align:middle line:84%
They're doing all
kinds of things

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.619 align:middle line:84%
that these guys
couldn't relate to.

00:28:42.619 --> 00:28:44.201 align:middle line:84%
They're also dealing
with the enemies,

00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:46.590 align:middle line:84%
meaning the Atlantees who
are really, really nasty.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.280 align:middle line:84%
The Lemurians welcomed them,
but the Atlantees didn't.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.155 align:middle line:90%
They became pharaohs.

00:28:50.155 --> 00:28:51.946 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really want
to become pharaohs,

00:28:51.946 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:90%
but they had to to control it.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.570 align:middle line:84%
The problem was there
were too many problems.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Two wars going at each
other, two cultures

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.183 align:middle line:90%
going at each other.

00:28:58.183 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So in 3100 BC, give or take
a few years, Egyptologists

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.766 align:middle line:84%
will tell you Egypt was
unified as the first state.

00:29:05.766 --> 00:29:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is what happened.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.890 align:middle line:90%
You had the northern people.

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:10.125 align:middle line:90%
They had 500 gods.

00:29:10.125 --> 00:29:11.530 align:middle line:90%
The southern ones had 500 gods.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:84%
They were polytheistic
like you wouldn't believe.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.590 align:middle line:84%
How do you unify people
without killing each other?

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.798 align:middle line:90%
Because they hate each other.

00:29:16.798 --> 00:29:18.060 align:middle line:90%
They were different people.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the concept
of hell was developed.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:10%
In my "Egypt" book I talk about
in details how in 3100 BC,

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.870 align:middle line:10%
the mystery school priests
from northern and southern part

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.770 align:middle line:10%
of Egypt-- upper and
lower as we call them--

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.550 align:middle line:10%
they got together
and said, look,

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.940 align:middle line:10%
we're going to form a state.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:90%
How do we control the masses?

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Now we have 1,000 gods.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.932 align:middle line:84%
So they created one
new god to do it.

00:29:40.932 --> 00:29:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Ra was the main god.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Ra, the sun god.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Every culture worshiped the sun.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So because the Egyptian
mystery school priests

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:48.970 align:middle line:84%
were experts in going
out of the body--

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.261 align:middle line:84%
if you read the Egyptian
"Book of the Dead," the oldest

00:29:51.261 --> 00:29:53.190 align:middle line:84%
religious book in
the world, it's

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.484 align:middle line:84%
chock full of out
of body experiences.

00:29:55.484 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
when they would go out

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.470 align:middle line:84%
of the body-- of course,
these were nasty people.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.750 align:middle line:84%
These mystery school priests,
these weren't time travelers.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:01.916 align:middle line:90%
These were just politicians.

00:30:01.916 --> 00:30:03.741 align:middle line:90%
And they were nasty.

00:30:03.741 --> 00:30:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So they would go to
the lower astral plane

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:06.610 align:middle line:84%
because that's--
when you're nasty,

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:84%
that's where you go
most of the time.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.259 align:middle line:90%
They called that hell.

00:30:10.259 --> 00:30:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And then they would go to the
upper astral plane-- not heaven

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
or nirvana, but to the upper
astral, which is a dimension.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:90%
It's much more positive.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Very, very positive.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.170 align:middle line:90%
They called that heaven.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they
just created hell.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:24.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you can
control the masses with fear.

00:30:24.135 --> 00:30:25.051 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: With fear.

00:30:25.051 --> 00:30:26.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, you got to have a god.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.520 align:middle line:90%
You can't just have hell.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:90%
So who is the god?

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:29.670 align:middle line:90%
They called it Apophis.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Apophis was the serpent.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they got mentality,
the garden of Eden thing.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, he lives
in the fires of hell.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:42.196 align:middle line:84%
That's a direct quote from the
Egyptian "Book of the Dead."

00:30:42.196 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
There was a book
that was written

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:84%
in 1964, a scholarly book
by this guy named Hupert.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And I quoted him
in my Egypt book

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.510 align:middle line:84%
to show that before
3100 BC-- they've

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:84%
done the research-- not one
culture, not one civilization,

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.720 align:middle line:84%
nothing across the world ever
mentioned the hell or devil.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Not until 3100 BC.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
because of Egypt

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:05.140 align:middle line:84%
being the source of
eventually Moses and Israel

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and the Jewish
religion, and then

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Islamic religion
being a kick-off

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.730 align:middle line:84%
of the other two, especially
the Jewish religion.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.817 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
all this idea of hell

00:31:13.817 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:84%
distributed because it
was used successfully

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.150 align:middle line:90%
to scare people into--

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was distributed
across all of the religions?

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:90%
But invented, made up.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Invented.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Just made up by
the Egyptian mystery school

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:22.789 align:middle line:90%
priests.

00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.201 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're in-- so we've kind
of skipped past the lifestyle

00:31:27.201 --> 00:31:27.950 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis, but--

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Atlantis was
basically similar to Lemuria,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.980 align:middle line:84%
except it was controlled
more by the military.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Militarized.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They had
their beautiful gardens.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.773 align:middle line:84%
It was a smaller
continent, of course.

00:31:36.773 --> 00:31:38.090 align:middle line:90%
It was a much smaller area.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.415 align:middle line:90%
But they had their mastodons.

00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:41.350 align:middle line:84%
They had their
beautiful animals.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.170 align:middle line:90%
They did science.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:90%
They had temples of healing.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:43.956 align:middle line:90%
They had the crystals.

00:31:43.956 --> 00:31:45.792 align:middle line:84%
They used the crystals
for energy sources.

00:31:45.792 --> 00:31:46.750 align:middle line:90%
So it was like Lemuria.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.380 align:middle line:84%
They had temples of wisdom
and temples of healing, too.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:84%
The difference was
the basic angst

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.610 align:middle line:84%
of the society was much more
materialistic, much more

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.830 align:middle line:84%
greedy, and much
more militaristically

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:00.132 align:middle line:90%
controlled versus Lemuria.

00:32:00.132 --> 00:32:01.340 align:middle line:90%
That was the only difference.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One woman
I know who was

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:08.070 align:middle line:84%
very adept at going into
past and future lifetimes

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.340 align:middle line:84%
was recalling one
time in Atlantis

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.770 align:middle line:84%
where the people were scattering
to run under trees and canopy

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.140 align:middle line:84%
because they were being
attacked from the air.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And this again, reflecting
the militarization

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:21.780 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.071 align:middle line:84%
Now, when Dolores Cannon
talks about it with the people

00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:27.270 align:middle line:84%
that she's regressed, one story
that keeps coming up a lot

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:84%
are the genetic experiments
that were happening

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:33.120 align:middle line:84%
between cross
species so to speak,

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
which gives way to a lot of the
lore that was later passed down

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:41.100 align:middle line:84%
of these half-animal
and half-human people.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.677 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a
little bit about that

00:32:42.677 --> 00:32:44.510 align:middle line:84%
so we can see where
those legends came from?

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.635 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's like "The
Island of Doctor Moreau"

00:32:46.635 --> 00:32:47.790 align:middle line:90%
here mentality.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.682 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria wasn't doing
that, but Atlantis was.

00:32:49.682 --> 00:32:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I told you, Atlantis
had a problem.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:84%
They had people that
were very greedy.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of like the
Nazis during World War II

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:84%
doing genetic
experiments and trying

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.480 align:middle line:84%
to create the super-race,
that kind of thing.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Except they were doing
it with different animals

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.419 align:middle line:90%
and cross-breeding.

00:33:02.419 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were
violating a lot of laws

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.640 align:middle line:84%
of nature, which was one of
the problems where the energy

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.890 align:middle line:84%
levels among Atlantis was like,
you guys have-- you just broke

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:13.830 align:middle line:90%
too many rules.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:84%
They had nuclear power, so
they were doing experiments

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:84%
with nuclear power,
atomic power.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.707 align:middle line:84%
Both Atlantis and Lemuria
were above gas belts.

00:33:20.707 --> 00:33:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reasons why they
both eventually collapsed

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:84%
in three different
major occasions

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:84%
is because the gas
belt simply exploded.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, why they
exploded is debated.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.299 align:middle line:84%
We feel that it was not just
negative energy of the universe

00:33:31.299 --> 00:33:32.840 align:middle line:84%
because they violated
universal laws.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:84%
But we also feel that
there were comets.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.980 align:middle line:90%
There were pole shifts.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And there were, of
course, the experiments

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.332 align:middle line:84%
with atomic power that would
cause major problems-- sort

00:33:40.332 --> 00:33:42.540 align:middle line:84%
of like if you're above--
if you're living on the San

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.925 align:middle line:84%
Andreas fault, you better
be prepared for earthquakes

00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:48.300 align:middle line:84%
because you've
going to get them.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Or you live in Hawaii
or Japan-- islands.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.280 align:middle line:84%
They get earthquakes
all the time.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:90%
So we feel it's a combination.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.410 align:middle line:84%
But there were
geophysical events.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:57.120 align:middle line:90%
There were pole shifts.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:57.690 align:middle line:90%
There were comets.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.189 align:middle line:84%
There were other things that
could have also facilitated it.

00:34:00.189 --> 00:34:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't be difficult
to decompose or just destroy

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.950 align:middle line:90%
a continent.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But especially if
you're above a gas belt.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
that theory-- why

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.713 align:middle line:84%
it was laughed at and
mocked many years ago,

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:09.860 align:middle line:90%
about 50 years ago.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Recently, in the last 10 years,
geologists and geophysicists

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.040 align:middle line:84%
have confirmed the
gas belt theory.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So they're not going to say
Atlantis and Lemuria existed,

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:84%
but they're going to
say the theory behind

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.940 align:middle line:90%
it is quite sound.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.159 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
knowledge and technologies

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:26.862 align:middle line:84%
and such-- some of
them, not a lot.

00:34:26.862 --> 00:34:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But some of them
actually then were

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.750 align:middle line:84%
preserved in the
upper days of Egypt,

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.880 align:middle line:84%
when we're going back
30,000, 35,000 years ago.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, John Anthony West
will say that he believes

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.210 align:middle line:84%
some of the ancient
monuments that

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.230 align:middle line:84%
are very well-known,
such as the Sphinx,

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.929 align:middle line:84%
may date back as
far as 35,000 years.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.896 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is more
or less in alignment

00:34:46.896 --> 00:34:48.854 align:middle line:84%
with what you're saying
with the establishment.

00:34:48.854 --> 00:34:49.199 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:50.570 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
that, first of all,

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.069 align:middle line:84%
Tibet was also a
location where they

00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:90%
would keep the secret knowledge.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.139 align:middle line:84%
The crystals of
Atlantis, they would

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:90%
have certain compartments.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.540 align:middle line:84%
You know how we found
The Dead Sea Scrolls

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and they were preserved in
these vases in the caves

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.405 align:middle line:84%
because they preserved
in the desert?

00:35:03.405 --> 00:35:05.030 align:middle line:84%
They did preserve
the knowledge or else

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:06.488 align:middle line:84%
we would all be
very primitive now.

00:35:06.488 --> 00:35:08.710 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have any of the
technology we have today.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.130 align:middle line:90%
So Tibet was another location.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
because the Sphinx represents

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.630 align:middle line:84%
the body of a lion, people
go back and they say,

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:16.470 align:middle line:90%
well, 11,000 BC--

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Leo.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.913 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: --and this and that.

00:35:17.913 --> 00:35:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, in reality, there were
too man things going on then.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.503 align:middle line:90%
That wouldn't be relevant.

00:35:21.503 --> 00:35:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back
to about 35,000--

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.760 align:middle line:84%
if you trace all the
astrological periods,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.810 align:middle line:84%
they average about
2,000 years per sign.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:84%
If you go all the way
back, 24,000 and add 11,

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.510 align:middle line:90%
that's 35,000 BC.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:90%
That's more likely.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.050 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
some of the people

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.591 align:middle line:84%
in the field don't
like to hear that.

00:35:38.591 --> 00:35:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the 10,500
BC or 11,000 BC

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.517 align:middle line:84%
gets so much press in so many
books and so many scholars--

00:35:44.517 --> 00:35:46.350 align:middle line:84%
or at least what people
think are scholars--

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.050 align:middle line:84%
that when you go back 35,000,
they say, my goodness.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.520 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.100 align:middle line:84%
The kings list that
we get from Egypt

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.350 align:middle line:90%
came from a man named Manetho.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Most of it came from Manetho.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.870 align:middle line:84%
He was a scholar in the third
century BC in Heliopolis.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:35:58.650 --> 00:35:59.995 align:middle line:90%
He talks about Zep Tepi.

00:35:59.995 --> 00:36:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Zep Tepi is the first time.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's 35,000 BC.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.020 align:middle line:90%
They do the numbers on that.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:05.900 align:middle line:90%
People say, oh, he's ridiculous.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you accept
his kings list,

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.240 align:middle line:84%
which has been corroborated
by independent sources.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it has.

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But now
you're making fun of him

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.976 align:middle line:84%
because he's talking about
something that just because you

00:36:12.976 --> 00:36:14.529 align:middle line:90%
can't believe in it.

00:36:14.529 --> 00:36:15.320 align:middle line:90%
You can't prove it.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.225 align:middle line:84%
It's before the
flood, so we don't

00:36:16.225 --> 00:36:17.420 align:middle line:90%
have any evidence of that.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:22.570 align:middle line:84%
But Zep Tepi was about the time
of the Leo constellation, which

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.610 align:middle line:90%
would be about 35,000 BC.

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So West is most likely
right, and I agree with him.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He is.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And very few Egyptologists
will step out on that limb.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:84%
We know Robert Chalk has
done some wonderful work just

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.860 align:middle line:90%
looking at the water erosion.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's putting it back to
between 10,000 and 12,000 years

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:37.800 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.716 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Which again,
goes against history.

00:36:39.716 --> 00:36:42.752 align:middle line:84%
Because history says 4,500
years ago, blah, blah, blah.

00:36:42.752 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can put their
name on a monument.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.049 align:middle line:84%
I can put my name on the
Empire State Building

00:36:47.049 --> 00:36:47.840 align:middle line:90%
and say I built it.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.464 align:middle line:84%
And somebody in the
future may say, oh,

00:36:49.464 --> 00:36:51.270 align:middle line:84%
it's Dr. Goldberg's
monument to himself.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:53.000 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.025 align:middle line:84%
So basically, that's the
mentality involved here.

00:36:56.025 --> 00:36:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, in addition to
this, in ancient times

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.477 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria also is very big on
teleportation experiments.

00:37:01.477 --> 00:37:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk a little
bit about teleportation

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.768 align:middle line:90%
to show you how people think.

00:37:04.768 --> 00:37:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not just Star Trek
with the little sparkles.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:08.142 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
is represented

00:37:08.142 --> 00:37:09.660 align:middle line:84%
in some of the
hieroglyphics in Egypt.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.618 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, it is.

00:37:10.618 --> 00:37:11.972 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So follow through.

00:37:11.972 --> 00:37:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: In
Abydos, you're going

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to have both a
helicopter, two UFOs,

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:90%
and a stealth jet represented.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And this was done in what's
called the Ptolemy Era, which

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.510 align:middle line:90%
is 300 BC to 30 BC.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Nobody argues about the dates
when these carvings were done.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:29.700 align:middle line:84%
There's also one in Dendera
which shows actual electricity.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.955 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but there's
a very significant depiction

00:37:32.955 --> 00:37:36.750 align:middle line:84%
on a wall carving in Dendera,
which is by Cairo, showing--

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.666 align:middle line:90%
it looks like Crookes tubes.

00:37:38.666 --> 00:37:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Two pillars that look like
Crookes tubes, a Van de Graaff

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.077 align:middle line:84%
generator, rated cables,
which is electricity.

00:37:45.077 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Any electrical engineer
would tell you that.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But the Crookes tubes
is a preliminary

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:90%
or a predecessor to television.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.252 align:middle line:84%
So not only does it show
electricity in Ancient Egypt.

00:37:53.252 --> 00:37:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they electroplated
their vases and their jewelry,

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.640 align:middle line:84%
so they had knowledge
of electricity.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.689 align:middle line:84%
In order to build
the pyramid of Giza,

00:37:59.689 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:84%
in order to get inside because
they didn't use torches.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.370 align:middle line:90%
There's no soot on the walls.

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.880 align:middle line:84%
They had to have electrical--
had to have a lighting source.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is, conservatively,
it's lighting, electricity.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.170 align:middle line:84%
On the more extreme
level, Ancient Egypt

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:84%
may have had television
because they had Crookes tubes.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, you won't
believe that unless you

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.200 align:middle line:84%
find a "TV Guide" in the
hieroglyphics, I grant you.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But it does signify, definitely,
electricity in Ancient Egypt.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.710 align:middle line:90%
So those are examples.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And who have them
the technology?

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Time travelers.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:84%
ETs somewhat, but
also time travelers.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So teleportation, let's
discuss that a little bit.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
what you see on TV.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not like
sparkles in Star Trek.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:36.894 align:middle line:84%
Teleportation is
a technique that's

00:38:36.894 --> 00:38:38.060 align:middle line:90%
reported in ancient culture.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.450 align:middle line:90%
The East Indians reported it.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.480 align:middle line:90%
The Tibetans report it.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Many cultures report it.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:44.775 align:middle line:90%
It's actually quite possible.

00:38:44.775 --> 00:38:47.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've done it myself
and I train people to do it.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy to do.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:48.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a very rare thing.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:50.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the hardest thing
to do in hypnosis.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.995 align:middle line:84%
But in teleportation,
what you do--

00:38:51.995 --> 00:38:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're separating it
from out of body experiences.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.345 align:middle line:84%
In teleportation,
the physical body

00:38:55.345 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:84%
is moving from one
location to another.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.380 align:middle line:84%
An out of body
experience, it's the soul

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.070 align:middle line:84%
that's traveling
in its astral body.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But the body stays the
same wherever you are.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.210 align:middle line:90%
But the soul travels.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can perceive
and this and that.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So here's an example of
a case I call Vivian.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.830 align:middle line:84%
She's reported in my "Exploring
the Fifth Dimension" book.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.545 align:middle line:84%
I trained Vivian
to do teleportation

00:39:14.545 --> 00:39:15.920 align:middle line:84%
because she was
interested in it.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.586 align:middle line:84%
It's a very difficult
technique, but she

00:39:17.586 --> 00:39:19.641 align:middle line:90%
had no experience in doing it.

00:39:19.641 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Vivian is a woman who's got
a very abusive, physically

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:22.690 align:middle line:90%
abusive boyfriend.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:23.746 align:middle line:90%
He's a real jerk.

00:39:23.746 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
He beats her up and she
can't end her relationship.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:27.786 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things we're working on.

00:39:27.786 --> 00:39:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm training her
to do teleportation.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And very synchronistically,
the following week

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.710 align:middle line:84%
she's on the freeway with
her idiot boyfriend and he

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.290 align:middle line:90%
gets into an argument with her.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And he opens up the passenger
door and throws her out.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, there's a car coming
in the opposite direction 75

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:45.520 align:middle line:90%
miles an hour.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:90%
She's got a twisted ankle.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:48.290 align:middle line:90%
She can't run.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And all she thinks is the
post-hypnotic instruction

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.136 align:middle line:90%
I gave her to do teleportation.

00:39:52.136 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you
know, the car that's

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.340 align:middle line:84%
going to hit her goes
right through her,

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.180 align:middle line:84%
witnessed by the driver
as well as her boyfriend.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.470 align:middle line:84%
She, all of a sudden,
doesn't know what's going on.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And she's in her apartment
sitting on her couch

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.830 align:middle line:90%
with a twisted ankle.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Her life was saved.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:07.140 align:middle line:90%
I didn't save her life, she did.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.690 align:middle line:90%
That's teleportation.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So I asked her, could you
describe what the teleportation

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.130 align:middle line:90%
experience consists of?

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.920 align:middle line:90%
And this is what she said.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a little quote
from my book here.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:19.520 align:middle line:84%
"It felt almost like I
was caught in a giant web.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the world exploded
into countless billions

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:24.250 align:middle line:90%
of glowing threads.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.190 align:middle line:84%
They stretched away
in all directions

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and they intersected
everything, including me.

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The overall effect was
very similar to looking

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:36.740 align:middle line:84%
at a hologram, except it was
visceral as well as visual.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.510 align:middle line:84%
You could see and feel the
image at the same time."

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've had other patients
describe teleportation.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And there are documented
cases of teleportation

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.635 align:middle line:90%
that survive the literature.

00:40:47.635 --> 00:40:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this explosion
into billions of bits

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.040 align:middle line:90%
is a common theme?

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.206 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: And the threads.

00:40:53.206 --> 00:40:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's an example of
the most documented case

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:56.840 align:middle line:90%
of teleportation.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.423 align:middle line:84%
There are many cases,
and most of them

00:40:58.423 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:84%
are British and Argentina cases
if you read the literature.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But here's the most
documented case.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go back
to 1593, Mexico City.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:10.340 align:middle line:84%
On the evening of
October 24, 1593,

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.350 align:middle line:84%
a Spanish soldier-- now
you have to understand,

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Spain owned Mexico.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.590 align:middle line:90%
They were colonial powers.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But the uniforms and the guns
in Spain, the European model,

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.694 align:middle line:90%
was very different in Mexico.

00:41:19.694 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So you would stand
out like a sore thumb

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.805 align:middle line:90%
if you had a Spanish outfit.

00:41:22.805 --> 00:41:25.019 align:middle line:84%
A man's right in front
of the mayor's office--

00:41:25.019 --> 00:41:26.060 align:middle line:90%
the governor's, whatever.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.040 align:middle line:90%
He's right there.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.260 align:middle line:90%
A guy comes out.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.840 align:middle line:84%
The police come out and
they say, who are you?

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.440 align:middle line:90%
He says, I couldn't do it.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.406 align:middle line:90%
It's not my fault.

00:41:34.406 --> 00:41:35.780 align:middle line:84%
They said, what's
not your fault?

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:84%
He says, the governor
was murdered.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.370 align:middle line:90%
I was one of the guards.

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:40.115 align:middle line:84%
I tried to save him
and I couldn't do it.

00:41:40.115 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the
governor of who?

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:43.260 align:middle line:90%
The governor's right up there.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.880 align:middle line:90%
He says, the governor of Manila.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.390 align:middle line:84%
That's one Don Gomez
Perez Dasmarinas.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.477 align:middle line:90%
And they said, you're loco.

00:41:50.477 --> 00:41:52.560 align:middle line:84%
They took him into jail
and they interrogated him.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.440 align:middle line:84%
They knew he was Spanish because
of the outfit and the gun.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:84%
He was interrogated
by the police.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.575 align:middle line:84%
Then they brought the
priest in to an exorcism

00:41:57.575 --> 00:41:59.380 align:middle line:84%
because in those days
that's what they did.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So now you had the historians
and the Catholic Church

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:90%
acknowledging this guy.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.930 align:middle line:84%
They keep him in
jail for two months.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Two months later,
they send the ships

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:10.780 align:middle line:84%
around the world to bring in
the news as well as supplies

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.280 align:middle line:90%
because Spain owned Mexico.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Spanish ship comes
in into Mexico harbor

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:17.195 align:middle line:84%
and they say-- the
guy says, you know,

00:42:17.195 --> 00:42:20.409 align:middle line:84%
we had this really-- oh, the
gentleman first on the ship

00:42:20.409 --> 00:42:22.450 align:middle line:84%
says to the local authorities,
he goes, you know,

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:24.370 align:middle line:84%
the governor of
Manila was murdered.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:25.470 align:middle line:90%
And they said, really?

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.970 align:middle line:90%
When?

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.320 align:middle line:90%
He says, a couple of months ago.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.900 align:middle line:84%
He says, why don't you
come to the jail a minute.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.650 align:middle line:84%
We got somebody we
want you to see.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.691 align:middle line:84%
The man's name was Gil
Perez, the Spanish soldier

00:42:32.691 --> 00:42:33.940 align:middle line:90%
who was imprisoned.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.300 align:middle line:90%
He recognized him.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.800 align:middle line:90%
He said, he's one of the guards.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, how do
you get from Manila, which

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:44.290 align:middle line:84%
is 9,000 miles away
from Mexico City,

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and not only did he
go instantaneously,

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.380 align:middle line:84%
he actually traveled
back in time

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.245 align:middle line:84%
because the governor
was murdered

00:42:49.245 --> 00:42:50.640 align:middle line:90%
in the morning of the 25th.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So he traveled back in time
12 hours when he teleported.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:55.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
way you can do it.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
I had a friend--

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:01.830 align:middle line:84%
this is 20 years ago or so--
who had just started opening up

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.310 align:middle line:84%
into meditation
and these things.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:05.350 align:middle line:90%
And he was naturally very open.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And he called me up
very frightened one day.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've just had
the worst experience.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
he was with his family

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and they were on a
picnic on the front lawn.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
he lost awareness

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.940 align:middle line:84%
of the current reality and
he was in a train wreck.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And everything was
helter skelter.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.560 align:middle line:90%
And people were screaming.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was living
this reality fully.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.190 align:middle line:84%
That was the day that Amtrak
had this disastrous train

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:32.280 align:middle line:90%
wreck back East.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.614 align:middle line:84%
And he, somehow, was
living that reality.

00:43:35.614 --> 00:43:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, they could
call that clairvoyance,

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.904 align:middle line:84%
but he's actually entering
the fabric of space-time

00:43:39.904 --> 00:43:40.980 align:middle line:90%
in the fifth dimension.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can observe any other
event past, present, or future.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:44.325 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:44.325 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And he had gone into that.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Or parallel.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.523 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Let me give
you another example,

00:43:47.523 --> 00:43:50.610 align:middle line:84%
show you how lives can be
saved by teleportation.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Two young girls are
going home from school.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.940 align:middle line:90%
They're about eight years old.

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Brenda and Amy as I
call them in Texas.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And as they're walking
along the street going home,

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.545 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden a
teenager about 18,

00:44:02.545 --> 00:44:05.340 align:middle line:84%
19 years old dressed
in a blue tennis outfit

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.240 align:middle line:90%
tackles them both.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And as she tackles
them, a drunken teenager

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:12.600 align:middle line:84%
comes up the curb and would
have killed both the girls.

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.750 align:middle line:90%
So all three of them are safe.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:18.452 align:middle line:84%
The teenager that saved their
life disappears instantly.

00:44:18.452 --> 00:44:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, the girls
think that-- who are

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:21.582 align:middle line:84%
they going to tell
about this in Texas?

00:44:21.582 --> 00:44:23.040 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
burn you in effigy

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.640 align:middle line:90%
if you talk about this, right?

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.460 align:middle line:90%
So they just forget about it.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was able to work
with Amy years later.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And she told me that
when she was about 18,

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.172 align:middle line:84%
senior in high school, just
graduating from high school,

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.630 align:middle line:84%
she wanted to go
out to play tennis

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.370 align:middle line:90%
with Brenda, her best friend.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.915 align:middle line:84%
So she goes to pick
her up to play tennis,

00:44:40.915 --> 00:44:43.670 align:middle line:84%
knocks on the door,
and Brenda answers

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:84%
the door in a light
blue tennis outfit.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Exactly the same outfit that was
used in the previous experience

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.970 align:middle line:90%
10 years prior to that.

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:55.804 align:middle line:84%
And she goes-- Brenda
says, where are we?

00:44:55.804 --> 00:44:56.970 align:middle line:90%
She goes, what's the matter?

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:59.800 align:middle line:84%
She goes, I just
blacked out and I

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.440 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what's happened
for the last 20 minutes.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So Brenda blacked out,
teleported back in time

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.330 align:middle line:84%
by 10 years, saved her
and her best friend,

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and then disappeared back
into the space-time continuum,

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:15.670 align:middle line:84%
back into 10 years ahead
when she was 19 years old.

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:16.726 align:middle line:90%
So that's an example of--

00:45:16.726 --> 00:45:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
fascinating.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Of
actually, teleportation.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And these are real
experiences reported.

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.143 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:22.143 --> 00:45:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I had
many cases of those.

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:27.134 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the East
Coast years ago, I was--

00:45:27.134 --> 00:45:28.800 align:middle line:84%
it was between Christmas
and New Year's.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.990 align:middle line:90%
And it was very cold out.

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:31.365 align:middle line:90%
I live in Baltimore.

00:45:31.365 --> 00:45:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my
favorite vacation

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.109 align:middle line:84%
was going to Montego
Bay, Jamaica.

00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:37.192 align:middle line:84%
And I had three dogs at
the time, three schnauzers

00:45:37.192 --> 00:45:38.895 align:middle line:84%
at the time-- Karma,
Phoenix, and Alpha.

00:45:38.895 --> 00:45:41.334 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, I
have patients coming in.

00:45:41.334 --> 00:45:42.000 align:middle line:90%
It was a Sunday.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.230 align:middle line:84%
It was during the playoffs,
the football players.

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:46.146 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I got patients
coming to tomorrow.

00:45:46.146 --> 00:45:48.087 align:middle line:84%
I just wish I was in
Montego Bay right now.

00:45:48.087 --> 00:45:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next thing-- I said
to myself, why don't I teleport?

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.475 align:middle line:84%
So I changed into
my bathing suit.

00:45:52.475 --> 00:45:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Remember, the whole body goes.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:58.524 align:middle line:84%
And I have my little radio, my
Coppertone, my little sandals.

00:45:58.524 --> 00:46:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on the couch and the
dogs are looking at me like--

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your little tote.

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
my little dogs are

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.830 align:middle line:84%
looking at me like,
what's he doing?

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Toto.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Toto, yes.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:06.879 align:middle line:90%
Not in Kansas anymore, right?

00:46:06.879 --> 00:46:07.919 align:middle line:90%
Not in Baltimore anymore.

00:46:07.919 --> 00:46:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing I knew, I'm
on the beach in Montego Bay.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:11.780 align:middle line:84%
It's an isolated
part of the beach.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.238 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
brunette young woman.

00:46:13.238 --> 00:46:15.540 align:middle line:84%
She's probably a college
student on a towel.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm only about
10 feet from her.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So I walk up to her
and I said, hello.

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.713 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind if I
put my towel down?

00:46:21.713 --> 00:46:23.265 align:middle line:84%
She goes, where
did you come from?

00:46:23.265 --> 00:46:25.150 align:middle line:84%
You can't run very
fast on the beach.

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:26.600 align:middle line:84%
She goes, this place
was isolated until just

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.390 align:middle line:90%
like a second ago.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
move kind of fast.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:30.340 align:middle line:84%
She goes, OK, put
your towel down.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.295 align:middle line:84%
So we're having
a good afternoon.

00:46:31.295 --> 00:46:33.086 align:middle line:84%
We're swimming and
relaxing and everything.

00:46:33.086 --> 00:46:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, how long
you going to be in town?

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
my flight is going

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.990 align:middle line:84%
to occur pretty
quickly, actually.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing
I know, I'm back

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.030 align:middle line:90%
in Baltimore in my living room.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:44.443 align:middle line:84%
Now people say to
me, come on, Doctor.

00:46:44.443 --> 00:46:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're delusional.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.126 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You had an
out-of-body experience.

00:46:47.126 --> 00:46:48.760 align:middle line:84%
You had a dream, a
fantasy, whatever.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.746 align:middle line:84%
Or course, it was a
hot college student.

00:46:50.746 --> 00:46:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's
all very fine.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:53.813 align:middle line:84%
Except I go up to--
into my living room,

00:46:53.813 --> 00:46:56.200 align:middle line:90%
I had a very full-length mirror.

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.200 align:middle line:90%
My bathing suit was wet.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.870 align:middle line:90%
There was sand in my sneakers.

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And most significantly,
I had a suntan.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:04.402 align:middle line:84%
Trust me, you don't get suntans
in Baltimore on December 28.

00:47:04.402 --> 00:47:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is wild.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:05.900 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.191 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I've done everything
you can with hypnosis,

00:47:08.191 --> 00:47:10.220 align:middle line:84%
but you can't fantasize
or fake a suntan.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The only
example is teleportation,

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.750 align:middle line:90%
the T word as I call it.

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:14.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's an example.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, it's
very difficult to do,

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.622 align:middle line:90%
but people can do it.

00:47:17.622 --> 00:47:19.580 align:middle line:84%
The important thing is
that-- it's interesting,

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.290 align:middle line:84%
when it's done,
it's not dangerous.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.879 align:middle line:84%
It can often help you
grow or save lives

00:47:23.879 --> 00:47:25.420 align:middle line:84%
as I gave a couple
of examples about.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.496 align:middle line:84%
So teleportation is
a real experience.

00:47:27.496 --> 00:47:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:30.629 align:middle line:84%
And we'll all be doing
in, what, 35,000 BC?

00:47:30.629 --> 00:47:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: 35th century.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Something like that.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.803 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Actually,
the 25th century

00:47:33.803 --> 00:47:36.166 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
teleportation-- little places

00:47:36.166 --> 00:47:38.040 align:middle line:84%
in your home so you can
teleport around town.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:38.810 align:middle line:90%
So it's only 400 years.

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So mine as well
get a jump on it.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to
Egypt for a moment.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Because when you were talking
about these warring factions

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:48.040 align:middle line:84%
that the country was really
split psychologically,

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.535 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, and
in understanding--

00:47:49.535 --> 00:47:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Militarily, too.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Militarily as well.

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, this takes us into
the time also of Moses,

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:58.040 align:middle line:90%
and into the time of Akhenaten.

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.025 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
different suppositions.

00:48:00.025 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:84%
People are trying to go
back into history and piece

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:03.430 align:middle line:90%
together who Moses was.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Sir Laurence Gardner
thought maybe Moses

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.370 align:middle line:90%
was either Akhenaten himself.

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And others have said, maybe
even a brother of Akhenaten.

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And Freud thought
he was Akhenaten, too.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Freud thought
he was Akhenaten, too.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.710 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
something different.

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the day, the
time, and what was going on.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This is
what Manetho tell us.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Manetho was a very
interesting scholar

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.970 align:middle line:84%
because he gives us the
kings list corroborated.

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:22.942 align:middle line:90%
He was a brilliant man.

00:48:22.942 --> 00:48:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And people can knock
him all you want to,

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:28.090 align:middle line:90%
but I say yes until proven no.

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:29.710 align:middle line:90%
He talks about Akhenaten.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.314 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know Akhenaten's name
because Akhenaten's records

00:48:32.314 --> 00:48:34.730 align:middle line:84%
were wiped out until we found
his work about 100 years ago

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:35.240 align:middle line:90%
in Armana.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So he just calls him a different
name, but it's Akhenaten.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.090 align:middle line:90%
We all know it's Akhenaten.

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.690 align:middle line:90%
He has a chief priest.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:43.545 align:middle line:84%
He's a scribe, a
scholar, but he's also

00:48:43.545 --> 00:48:45.350 align:middle line:84%
like a sergeant at
arms and a successor

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:46.880 align:middle line:84%
should anything
happen to Akhenaten.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.830 align:middle line:84%
His name was Osiraseth,
named after Osiris.

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Akhenaten, in the fifth
year of his reign,

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:55.370 align:middle line:84%
says one god, Ra-Harakhte,
Ra the sun god.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So he says, Osiraseth, you
got to change your name.

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:01.262 align:middle line:90%
And Osiris says, OK.

00:49:01.262 --> 00:49:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, all the gods
were removed except Ra.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So he says, my
name is now Moses.

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what Manetho gives us.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:11.569 align:middle line:90%
Now, Moses is not a Hebrew name.

00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:12.485 align:middle line:90%
It's an Egyptian name.

00:49:12.485 --> 00:49:13.580 align:middle line:90%
It actually means water bearer.

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And there was Thutmosis.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:16.390 align:middle line:84%
There were many pharaohs
with Moses at the end.

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Many Moses.

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: So he becomes Moses.

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Moses is just a
man, but a very brilliant man.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.100 align:middle line:84%
A scholar, a politician,
and a scribe.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.160 align:middle line:90%
He kept a lot of records.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:84%
They say he wrote the
five books of Moses.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Wrote at least three of
them, but not Deuteronomy.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so what happens is
that Akhenaten is eventually--

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:36.040 align:middle line:84%
in the 17th year of
his reign, he's killed.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.410 align:middle line:90%
So now Moses is his successor.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.271 align:middle line:84%
So Moses is now going
to be the pharaoh.

00:49:40.271 --> 00:49:42.520 align:middle line:84%
The ones in Memphis, the
northern part of the country,

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.090 align:middle line:84%
they wanted
polytheism back again.

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:45.040 align:middle line:90%
They hated Akhenaten.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:45.880 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones
who killed him.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
monotheism did not

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.080 align:middle line:84%
serve the priests of the
day, and the pedagogs,

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.260 align:middle line:90%
and the coffers of the temples.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Right,
self-interest.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very corrupt.

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You're going to
get money from all the gods.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.910 align:middle line:90%
X number of dollars per god.

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:54.990 align:middle line:90%
They had a thousand gods.

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:57.820 align:middle line:90%
It adds up.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.640 align:middle line:90%
They declared war on Moses.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.140 align:middle line:90%
So now you have a Civil War.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.770 align:middle line:84%
You have Egypt in the middle,
Memphis being the center.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:06.270 align:middle line:84%
To the south, even
the Old Testament

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.120 align:middle line:84%
says Moses had an
Ethiopian wife.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, that means that the
southern part, Ethiopia,

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.340 align:middle line:84%
which is Somalia today,
would be his ally.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:14.610 align:middle line:84%
To the north of Egypt,
you have the Sinai Desert.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:16.680 align:middle line:84%
You had various tribes
there that were also

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.449 align:middle line:90%
the ally of Moses and Akhenaten.

00:50:18.449 --> 00:50:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So Egypt is in the
middle, meaning Memphis.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.930 align:middle line:90%
They're polytheists.

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:23.670 align:middle line:90%
So Moses sends an emissary.

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:26.095 align:middle line:84%
He says, look, we're
in a Civil War.

00:50:26.095 --> 00:50:27.220 align:middle line:90%
No one's going to win this.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:28.719 align:middle line:84%
We're just going
to kill each other.

00:50:28.719 --> 00:50:30.260 align:middle line:90%
So I've got a suggestion.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I've got about 20,000,
25,000 people in Armana

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.910 align:middle line:90%
that are my followers.

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Let my people go.

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:41.160 align:middle line:84%
You let us go to the Sinai
Desert and you can have Egypt.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And that deal was struck,
and that was the exodus.

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:46.976 align:middle line:84%
And the exodus was
Moses, Egyptian Moses--

00:50:46.976 --> 00:50:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: His
followers, Egyptians,

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:52.745 align:middle line:84%
going into the Sinai
Desert and eventually

00:50:52.745 --> 00:50:53.620 align:middle line:90%
winding up in Israel.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's no records of
Israel until the 12th century

00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.615 align:middle line:84%
BC when one of Ramesses II's
son-- his name is Merneptah--

00:51:00.615 --> 00:51:03.430 align:middle line:84%
wrote a stele that mentions
Israel for the first time.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:06.166 align:middle line:84%
There's no records of
Israel before that at all--

00:51:06.166 --> 00:51:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if
you're looking at DNA,

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:08.740 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at the same--

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, they
all have the same DNA.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian, Palestinian, a
Jew, they're all the same.

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:14.050 align:middle line:90%
But here's the other thing.

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:15.695 align:middle line:90%
Israel has about 17 neighbors.

00:51:15.695 --> 00:51:17.060 align:middle line:90%
And they all kept records.

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Sumerians, the Canaanites, the
Hittites, all these people,

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:21.240 align:middle line:90%
they all kept records of wars.

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.781 align:middle line:84%
Not one of them ever
mentioned Israel

00:51:22.781 --> 00:51:24.414 align:middle line:90%
before the 12th century BC.

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a great
empire, don't you

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.413 align:middle line:84%
think somebody's going to put
it in their 6 o'clock news

00:51:28.413 --> 00:51:29.650 align:middle line:90%
segment?

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:31.270 align:middle line:90%
So there's a problem with that.

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, what I'm saying
is that I'm not the only one.

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.611 align:middle line:90%
There are scholars.

00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:37.280 align:middle line:84%
What I'm giving you are
scholarly information

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.100 align:middle line:90%
from Manetho and the history.

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.100 align:middle line:84%
If you talk about the way
the exodus is reported

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in the Old Testament,
which is not

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.300 align:middle line:84%
a historical document
but a religious document,

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.764 align:middle line:90%
they talk about 600,000 men.

00:51:47.764 --> 00:51:49.180 align:middle line:84%
If you add the
women and children,

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.638 align:middle line:84%
you got a couple of million
people going across the desert.

00:51:51.638 --> 00:51:55.690 align:middle line:84%
The artifacts would be like
going to a $0.99 store sale.

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:57.600 align:middle line:90%
They found very few artifacts.

00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Probably enough for
several thousand people

00:51:59.590 --> 00:52:01.520 align:middle line:84%
going across the
desert, but not what's

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.960 align:middle line:90%
reported in the Old Testament.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, you can't
go by that connection.

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.790 align:middle line:90%
So it was the Egyptians.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:10.630 align:middle line:84%
We know Akhenaten-- Amenhotep IV
changed his name to Akhenaten.

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:12.820 align:middle line:90%
He created monotheism.

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.649 align:middle line:90%
And the beat goes on here.

00:52:14.649 --> 00:52:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But don't forget, time
travelers are also around there.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But interestingly,
they were under the influences

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.810 align:middle line:84%
also of these time
travelers-- Osiris, Isis,

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:23.769 align:middle line:90%
Horace of the Horizon--

00:52:23.769 --> 00:52:25.268 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Taatos
was the main one.

00:52:25.268 --> 00:52:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Taatos.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that to me is a
really interesting part

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.610 align:middle line:84%
of this because people
say, what were the gods?

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:31.507 align:middle line:90%
Where were they from?

00:52:31.507 --> 00:52:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying they were
simply from the future?

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Here's an example.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
people, they criticize me

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:37.770 align:middle line:90%
about the racial issue.

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:39.010 align:middle line:90%
And let's clear it right now.

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:40.680 align:middle line:84%
They say, how come all
your human time travelers,

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.638 align:middle line:84%
they're always white,
blonde-haired, blue-eyed,

00:52:42.638 --> 00:52:43.810 align:middle line:90%
like a Malibu surfer?

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, they had dark skin races.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.070 align:middle line:90%
They had black races.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:47.530 align:middle line:90%
They had Native American.

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:49.550 align:middle line:84%
You have mixture, Hispanic
races in the future.

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Of course you do.

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:53.240 align:middle line:84%
The problem is when they send
the dark-skinned people back,

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.246 align:middle line:84%
the primitive people
would kill them.

00:52:55.246 --> 00:52:57.244 align:middle line:84%
They worshipped the
blonde Caucasian.

00:52:57.244 --> 00:52:57.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So they were in
danger of coming back.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.331 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: You see this today.

00:53:00.331 --> 00:53:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Ancient cultures, there are
statues of Osiris and Isis

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.870 align:middle line:84%
in Ancient Egypt
in the Sphinx that

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:08.400 align:middle line:84%
show a blonde, blue-eyed
Caucasian race.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Egyptians look like
Egyptians today back then.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So where did we get the blonde,
blue-eyed Caucasian race from?

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So somehow, this
was elevated to a god status

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.870 align:middle line:84%
through the-- maybe exposure to
these time travelers over time.

00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:22.049 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, look
at the technology.

00:53:22.049 --> 00:53:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
technology a minute.

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:25.589 align:middle line:84%
One of the technologies
that the time travel has

00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:28.330 align:middle line:84%
is called the
intergalactic line healer.

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And what this is-- it looks
like a pen flashlight.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.616 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a major
illness, they just go like this

00:53:33.616 --> 00:53:34.740 align:middle line:90%
and the illness disappears.

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Frequency, yep.

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They can regenerate
lost limbs with this.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:39.080 align:middle line:84%
You don't think people would
call them gods for that?

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They could resuscitate
a person who's

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:43.530 align:middle line:84%
died if they catch
them within 24 hours.

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can grow
food in arid lands.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So you're
going to be a god.

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They're
going to say you're

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:49.000 align:middle line:84%
a god because you're
doing technology.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.170 align:middle line:84%
If you take an airplane and
land in a primitive area that

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.507 align:middle line:84%
has no primitive-- people
have never seen that before.

00:53:55.507 --> 00:53:56.340 align:middle line:90%
They'll worship you.

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.300 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, gods from the sky.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's captured
in caves throughout the world.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.970 align:middle line:84%
You have ancient,
ancient cave art

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:04.740 align:middle line:84%
of these-- yeah,
extraterrestrials.

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Astronauts
are in there.

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Astronauts.

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And ETs
are pictured in caves.

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:08.796 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this is global.

00:54:08.796 --> 00:54:09.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not just in Egypt.

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get to-- we have
about-- oh, maybe six, seven,

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:13.600 align:middle line:90%
eight minutes left.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about the
notion of soul groups.

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes, people--
well, they do travel together.

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.470 align:middle line:84%
But these experiences
that are happening now,

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing very specific
patterns of soul groups who

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.380 align:middle line:84%
are coming back
together to reestablish

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.139 align:middle line:84%
certain knowledge of the time,
bring back certain knowledge

00:54:32.139 --> 00:54:33.180 align:middle line:90%
from the future, perhaps.

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk to us about this?

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.508 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure.

00:54:35.508 --> 00:54:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's go back to
England in the 17th century.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.710 align:middle line:84%
You had what's called the
Invisible College was set up.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Isaac Newton,
Christopher Wren, Boyle--

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.549 align:middle line:84%
these are guys who developed
gas laws, and mathematicians.

00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And Isaac Newton, of
course, discovered calculus.

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Although, there's a
debate about that.

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.531 align:middle line:90%
But he was a pretty bright guy.

00:54:50.531 --> 00:54:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Newtonian laws are
still relevant.

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.610 align:middle line:84%
They said that they apparently
had control or access

00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:57.820 align:middle line:84%
to knowledge that they felt
society wasn't ready for.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So they released it like
a contact time capsule.

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.270 align:middle line:90%
When you're ready for it.

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's always been around,
not just during the Invisible

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:05.161 align:middle line:90%
College in England.

00:55:05.161 --> 00:55:07.080 align:middle line:84%
There's apparently an
Invisible College today.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
is in soul groups,

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:09.670 align:middle line:84%
you have two kinds
of soul groups.

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:11.961 align:middle line:84%
You have people who reincarnate,
like you and your son,

00:55:11.961 --> 00:55:13.230 align:middle line:90%
and people and their families.

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:15.416 align:middle line:84%
Every dozen lives
you change groups.

00:55:15.416 --> 00:55:17.290 align:middle line:84%
You learn from people
or you prevent yourself

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:19.340 align:middle line:84%
from being victimized
if that's the issue.

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Those are soul groups
on the average person.

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But the other soul groups that
I believe you're referring to

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:25.620 align:middle line:84%
are the more
esoteric ones, where

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.790 align:middle line:84%
they're giving more
knowledge of not just

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:29.940 align:middle line:90%
technology but spiritual growth.

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.420 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get
all these-- it all

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:37.050 align:middle line:84%
comes from again, an Armanan
society, from Lemuria.

00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Their main Bible was the seven
sacred writings of Lemuria.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.480 align:middle line:84%
This seven sacred inspired
writings is what it was called.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And these were like
a seven-volume set

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:49.398 align:middle line:84%
that eventually became the
base of the Egyptian "Book

00:55:49.398 --> 00:55:51.110 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead," parts
of the Old Testament,

00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:53.568 align:middle line:84%
parts of the New Testament,
the "Tibetan Book of the Dead."

00:55:53.568 --> 00:55:55.240 align:middle line:84%
You name it, it all
comes from Lemuria.

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And again, they
had their mentality

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.130 align:middle line:84%
where when people are ready,
we're going to help them.

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if we
don't help them, we

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:02.933 align:middle line:84%
could have had-- look at
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:56:02.933 --> 00:56:06.490 align:middle line:84%
This world could've been
wiped out 50 years ago.

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:07.210 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't.

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons is
because in the dream levels,

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.143 align:middle line:84%
the time travelers can
interact with politicians,

00:56:12.143 --> 00:56:14.910 align:middle line:84%
with scientists, with
artists, et cetera.

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:16.376 align:middle line:84%
With people in the
know and people

00:56:16.376 --> 00:56:19.310 align:middle line:84%
who have control or
influence over society.

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So there is a soul
group of people

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.920 align:middle line:84%
that just try to keep us
so we don't get destroyed.

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And who have the best
reference for that?

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.357 align:middle line:84%
Time travelers because
they're us in the future.

00:56:28.357 --> 00:56:29.815 align:middle line:84%
They have the
biggest self-interest

00:56:29.815 --> 00:56:32.275 align:middle line:84%
in making sure that we
don't annihilate each other.

00:56:32.275 --> 00:56:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've also noticed when you--
I've lived in Sedona for years.

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
uncommon, you could

00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:40.940 align:middle line:84%
talk about any of this for
breakfast as a matter of fact.

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:42.090 align:middle line:90%
It was a common experience.

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Energy vortex.

00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:43.870 align:middle line:84%
The whole place is
an energy vortex.

00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
openness in terms of intuition

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.120 align:middle line:84%
where you could see
overlays among people

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.360 align:middle line:90%
that you had just met.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And so there was this
extreme recognition

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.660 align:middle line:90%
that was happening among people.

00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:58.470 align:middle line:84%
The lot of them,
the common theme

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:01.980 align:middle line:84%
was the trajectory going
from Lemuria, Atlantis

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:05.200 align:middle line:84%
through into Egypt, a lot of
people from the Egyptian times.

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.800 align:middle line:84%
But then you throw
in there and you

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.390 align:middle line:84%
start getting these other
stops along the way.

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:13.216 align:middle line:84%
A lot of French coming into the
American times, for example.

00:57:13.216 --> 00:57:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And so can you talk
just a little bit--

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.798 align:middle line:84%
we just have a couple
more minutes-- about some

00:57:16.798 --> 00:57:18.330 align:middle line:90%
of these great soul paths?

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, what
we're all merging to.

00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, if you
do past life regressions--

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.724 align:middle line:84%
and I've done over
35,000 of them--

00:57:22.724 --> 00:57:24.640 align:middle line:84%
you'll see people can
have an Asian past life,

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and then have a European life,
and a South American life.

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:27.990 align:middle line:90%
So there's a mixture there.

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But they're doing this for
a karmic purpose to learn.

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's an overview of what
we call the white brotherhood.

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.400 align:middle line:84%
There's the black brotherhood
is what it's called.

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.860 align:middle line:84%
There's the lower astral
entities and the negative ones.

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:38.460 align:middle line:84%
They always use white and
black for those colors.

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:39.876 align:middle line:84%
And then, the white
brotherhood is

00:57:39.876 --> 00:57:41.820 align:middle line:84%
our spirit guides,
archangels, et cetera.

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So these white
brotherhood so to speak

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.250 align:middle line:84%
are kind of moderating
this and making sure

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that we don't
destroy each other.

00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:50.479 align:middle line:90%
So that's the mentality.

00:57:50.479 --> 00:57:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly enough,
let's talk about California,

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:53.590 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:56.310 align:middle line:84%
California, where I
live, is a weird state

00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:58.200 align:middle line:90%
by most people's definition.

00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:01.500 align:middle line:84%
California today, if you look
at the San Andreas fault,

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:04.060 align:middle line:84%
people do not disagree--
geophysicists--

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.860 align:middle line:84%
that this could have been added
on to the Continental United

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:07.530 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:11.020 align:middle line:84%
What we feel today is
the East Coast of Lemuria

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.667 align:middle line:84%
is the West Coast
of United States.

00:58:12.667 --> 00:58:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:14.541 align:middle line:90%
And I've heard that many times.

00:58:14.541 --> 00:58:16.479 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That's why
you have California.

00:58:16.479 --> 00:58:17.895 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the
soil is different.

00:58:17.895 --> 00:58:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The whole kind of new
age-- I don't like that term

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:20.539 align:middle line:90%
and it's outdated.

00:58:20.539 --> 00:58:22.820 align:middle line:84%
But that whole spiritual
movement and the creativity.

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But don't
forget, the soil

00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:25.653 align:middle line:84%
changes as you leave
the state line.

00:58:25.653 --> 00:58:28.710 align:middle line:84%
That's like impossible
on a biochemical level.

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So California has always been
known as the strange place.

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Oregon and Washington state,
very liberal but very--

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:36.840 align:middle line:90%
call it new age.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:40.877 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying is that if
you look at the fault lines,

00:58:40.877 --> 00:58:42.710 align:middle line:84%
that's what would happen
in tectonic plates.

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:44.530 align:middle line:84%
If you break off
part of a continent

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and then you cement it on,
so to speak, to the next one,

00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:49.000 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
tectonic plates which

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.990 align:middle line:84%
result in faults,
which will result

00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:53.970 align:middle line:84%
in different climate, different
soil, and earthquakes.

00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have people
that are incarnating back

00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:57.120 align:middle line:90%
into that region--

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:58:57.370 --> 00:58:57.580 align:middle line:90%
Because they're attracted to it.

00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.801 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that are in
resonance with that Lemurian

00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:00.300 align:middle line:90%
energy?

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Exactly.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And the Atlantean energy
would be maybe some New York

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.074 align:middle line:84%
corporate executive or
some military general

00:59:06.074 --> 00:59:06.740 align:middle line:90%
in the Pentagon.

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Madison Street.

00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Madison Avenue.

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Madison Avenue.

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes,
controlling people.

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So people are attracted
to the energies based

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.624 align:middle line:84%
upon who they are,
what they want.

00:59:13.624 --> 00:59:16.040 align:middle line:84%
The more passive, the more
aggressive, the more assertive,

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.670 align:middle line:84%
whatever in between,
they're going

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:20.314 align:middle line:84%
to be attracted by not just
the soul grouping of people.

00:59:20.314 --> 00:59:20.980 align:middle line:90%
That's relevant.

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But also, the energy of
where they want to be.

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:26.110 align:middle line:84%
What kind of energy vortex
do they want to be in?

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:27.782 align:middle line:84%
A Wall Street
stockbroker is not going

00:59:27.782 --> 00:59:28.990 align:middle line:90%
to be in Sedona, necessarily.

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Not going to
be attracted to the city.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:33.106 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I didn't meet
too many of those there.

00:59:33.106 --> 00:59:35.856 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a couple formers that had
been through some epiphanies.

00:59:35.856 --> 00:59:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They saw
the light, so to speak.

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They saw the light.

00:59:38.590 --> 00:59:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, once again, I
thank you so much.

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.863 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the
upshot of all of this

00:59:42.863 --> 00:59:45.416 align:middle line:84%
is these visions that are seen
in the future, which we talked

00:59:45.416 --> 00:59:47.290 align:middle line:84%
about in our last
interview-- you should take

00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:49.360 align:middle line:84%
a look at that one--
really are of a much more

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.610 align:middle line:84%
hopeful future than what a
lot of people are saying.

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Much more hopeful.

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:54.104 align:middle line:84%
Once we get beyond the
century, we are on easy street.

00:59:54.104 --> 00:59:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There we go.

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: My pleasure, Regina.

00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beyond fascinating.

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I hope you found this topic
worthy of further research,

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.452 align:middle line:84%
