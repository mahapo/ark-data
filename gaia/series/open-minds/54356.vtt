00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I
don't think any of us

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:10%
need another story of
environmental collapse

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.860 align:middle line:10%
and economic decline.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:10%
But if there are elements
of this playing out,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:10%
then we need to have a better
way of contending with it.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Carolyn Baker has
written a series

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
of books that address
these challenges,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:84%
but she offers a rational
and beautiful way

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
of dealing with
them in her work,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
including her latest book,
"Collapsing Consciously."

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.210 align:middle line:84%
After all, as souls, we all
chose to be here at this time.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So we need to see
how we can make

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
the very best out of the
possibilities presented now.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And this means taking the
word apocalypse to a new level

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.000 align:middle line:84%
and out of the hands
of the fundamentalists.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.083 align:middle line:84%
I know that's one thing
we're going to start with.

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But first, everyone is alarmist
when it comes to anything

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:84%
having to do with our
decline, anything's decline.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.880 align:middle line:84%
We tend to be alarmist
about it, because

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:90%
of our fears of change and loss.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:90%
I totally get all of that.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.251 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, as souls, we
transcend everything in the end

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:84%
However, to me, the
conversation about this

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
has to do with do we really
choose as a species to let

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:84%
something as incredibly
precious as this earth

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:84%
go to such a state of decline
that we can't turn back

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:84%
from it, having to
abandon ship, as it were?

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, as a soul, you can
go where you want, disappear

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
into thin air once the
body suit's left behind.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.794 align:middle line:84%
But do we really
want to do that?

00:01:48.794 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted
to bring that up

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:84%
as the largest possible
context for the conversation.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And you're OK with that, right?

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CAROLYN BAKER: Yes,
yes, very much so.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the word apocalypse first.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Sure.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
bring this up in the book

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.283 align:middle line:84%
and say the word
apocalypse-- because that's

00:02:03.283 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of an
apocalyptic conversation.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't see that
word in the context

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.174 align:middle line:84%
that the various fundamental
groups on the planet,

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:84%
religious, politically,
and otherwise, see it.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: No.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:10%
Because first of all,
the word apocalypse

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:10%
in Greek, the original--
origin the word, actually

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:10%
means the unveiling.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean
particularly an ending.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.415 align:middle line:10%
And in all ancient traditions
in all the traditions

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:33.430 align:middle line:10%
of the world, when you
get into them more deeply,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:10%
when they talk about an ending,
there's always a beginning.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And with a beginning,
there's always an ending.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:90%
So those are inseparable.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we live in a culture
that wants to go up, up, up

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and progress,
progress, progress.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything's getting
better in every way.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that's a very young,
and I would say, immature idea.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Because for many
millennia, people

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:84%
have understood that the
way you progress spiritually

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and psychologically is
to go down and to go in,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:84%
not to go up and out and
get better and better,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and that we need those
times of descent.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
We need those
times of apocalypse

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.756 align:middle line:90%
in order to transform.

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.670 align:middle line:84%
We certainly need some
increased descent right now.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the interesting
thing is with everything

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that's going on-- and
this is not really

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.934 align:middle line:84%
part of this conversation--
but the observation

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that there are really so
few people from the younger

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.089 align:middle line:84%
generation that are
taking to the street,

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, to do
anything about it.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And we know, because the whole
societal structure and fabric

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:90%
has changed with social media.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of a way
of taking to the street.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
But there is something
that's lacking in potency

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
in the way any kind of
protest is being done now.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.679 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yes.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is a lack
of feet to the ground

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
passion in the protest that
existed, for example, when

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
astrologically, this
configuration existed

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:90%
40 years ago, for example.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well, I think there's a
different kind of protest going

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:84%
on than you and I may have
experienced in the '60s.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the way young
people are protesting today

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:84%
is not so much in the
streets, but perhaps

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.096 align:middle line:90%
in the organic farm fields.

00:04:20.096 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's true.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.425 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: And they're
changing their lifestyles.

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:84%
They're being forced to
change their lifestyles,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:84%
because they can't possibly
attain what our generation was

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:84%
able to attain-- you know
the so-called American dream.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:84%
They can't, for the most part,
live middle class lifestyles.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of them are choosing
not even to go to college.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Because who wants student
debt until you're 85.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are choosing to
do other kinds of professions,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
healing professions,
farming professions,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
other alternative technology
kinds of the professions.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm somewhat encouraged
by what I see with the younger

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.250 align:middle line:84%
generation because it's not
out there in your face protest,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.475 align:middle line:84%
but it is very much
a lifestyle change.

00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a more
quiet revolution.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yes.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you see
it through your work

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
in the people-- I mean, you
speak in a lot of places.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:90%
You have a large following.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing that
on the ground,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
that there is really quite a
shift, a sizable shift going

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: For young
people especially.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see that with
my son and his colleagues.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But these are Waldorfians
for the most part.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:90%
They're not like normal.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:84%
They're not part
of normal society.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm
very happy to hear

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.630 align:middle line:84%
that you find there are
strength in numbers there.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: I really
believe that there are.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful
opportunity in December

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
to go down to
University of Kentucky

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and spend a weekend with
students, and activist

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
students, actually, and to just
talk with them and be with them

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.037 align:middle line:84%
and see the kinds of
changes that they're making

00:05:51.037 --> 00:05:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and the way they're
doing things differently

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:90%
than I was actually aware of.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the older generations
are a different story.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.547 align:middle line:84%
But I'm very encouraged by
what I see young people doing.

00:06:01.547 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm glad to hear that.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're talking
about, essentially,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.652 align:middle line:90%
collapse and transformation.

00:06:07.652 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to put
this up toward the front

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.259 align:middle line:90%
of the conversation.

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:84%
You went through a couple
rounds of breast cancer

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:84%
where you had to face your own
potential demise or collapse.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you went
through a transformation.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And because that's such a heavy,
emotional and psychological

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.180 align:middle line:84%
experience to go
through, how did

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that temper your view of the
larger picture of basically

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.240 align:middle line:84%
the potential collapse of
large elements of civilization

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:84%
as we know it and
its transformation?

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well,
whether it's personal

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
collective, I don't

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
know if all of our
viewers got the memo,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.454 align:middle line:90%
but we're all going to die.

00:06:46.454 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.078 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Life is fatal.

00:06:48.078 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And no one gets
out of here alive.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And so when we are faced up
close with our own mortality

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and the end of things, as I
was talking about earlier,

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:90%
it profoundly changes us.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's an opportunity.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
It's an opportunity, as I
said, to go down and within

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and find out what
we're really made of.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:84%
I see that for us as individuals
and for us as a society.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I originally came
in contact with your work

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.710 align:middle line:84%
through Andrew Harvey, who's
a mutual friend of ours.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.335 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Right.

00:07:21.335 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We love Andrew
and his radical passion,

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:90%
radical activism.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And all of that has been--
certainly our Gaiam viewers

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:90%
are well familiar with it.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's coming from a
viewpoint, as you are,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:90%
that we are in collapse.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.201 align:middle line:90%
Now, do you find this--

00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: The collapse of
industrial civilization

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and the paradigm
on which it's built

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
is profoundly unraveling
on every level,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:90%
in terms of every institution.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.805 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let's start there.

00:07:50.805 --> 00:07:53.439 align:middle line:84%
This is the collapse of
industrial civilization.

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start with
that definition alone

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and what you mean
by that in terms

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:84%
of what you see in a
serious state of decline,

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:84%
let's say, past the
point of no return now.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Which systems?

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well, pretty
much all of them.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Energy, environment, religion,
education, health care-- all

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:84%
of the institutions are in a
profound state of unraveling.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they've
all been based

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.900 align:middle line:84%
on everything's getting
better and better.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And they've all been
based on unlimited growth,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:84%
that we should just keep
growing and growing and growing.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's fine if we
had 27 or 37 planets.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:90%
But we only have one planet.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:84%
And so our growth
has to be limited.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
created, this monstrosity

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
of industrial civilization,
which is now destroying us,

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle line:84%
is causing profound limits
as to how far we can continue

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
to go without eating
up and destroying

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.834 align:middle line:90%
the very planet that we live on.

00:08:56.834 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with
this, obviously,

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
has to come an economic
decline as well.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Absolutely.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about that a little bit,

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:90%
as how you see that unfolding.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Because in your book,
you talk about the fact

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.050 align:middle line:84%
that you don't see
employment as we know it now,

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.820 align:middle line:84%
where you have large
companies that are employing

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:90%
large numbers of people per se.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't see that continuing
even a decade out from now.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Probably not.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about your view

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening economically
and the effects that we'll

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:90%
be experiencing.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.541 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Well, let's see.

00:09:29.541 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
How many quarters
has it been now

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.420 align:middle line:90%
since the financial collapse?

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And we constantly hear,
we're in recovery.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:90%
We're in recovery.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:90%
And yet, look around you.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Look at all of the people
that don't have jobs.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Look at all of the people who
have thought they were going

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.036 align:middle line:84%
to have some kind of decent
retirement, and they don't.

00:09:48.036 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Look at all the young people who
are going to have student loan

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
debt forever and just
the headlines that you

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.860 align:middle line:84%
see every single
day on the internet

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
or in newsprint
regarding inequality,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:90%
financial inequality.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Wall Street
gets richer and richer.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.529 align:middle line:84%
And the middle class
gets poorer and poorer,

00:10:08.529 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
to the point where some people
are now questioning if we even

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.764 align:middle line:90%
have a middle class any longer.

00:10:12.764 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: And so you can't--
this isn't sustainable.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
to societies where

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:84%
you have this vast
inequality is inevitable

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:84%
unraveling to the point
where there are only a few

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
very, very rich and lots
and lots of really, really

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.102 align:middle line:90%
poor people.

00:10:32.102 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just
had a conversation

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:84%
with James Martinez about
the subject of cold fusion.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And he is looking at
the social ramifications

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and economic ramifications
of what this means.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Because on one
level, here you're

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
talking about the introduction
of a clean energy that

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
has the potential to
completely revitalize

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.770 align:middle line:84%
the planet on one level, in
that we're now operating on

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:84%
freely available,
free clean energy.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the downside of that,
as he was explaining,

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:14.680 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, we have
the advent of the 3D printer.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So here we have, I have a
cup, the cutest little cup

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that was given to
me in the shape

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:84%
of a heart, this little 3D
thing that was printed, right?

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And I understand you can
do pieces of houses now

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:90%
and many, many things.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:84%
This is going to become
more and more sophisticated.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:84%
What we were talking
about is with the advent

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
of these amazing
technologies also

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.945 align:middle line:90%
comes massive unemployment.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:39.080 align:middle line:84%
You're not needing
people to do these jobs.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that
for a little bit.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a--
to me, this is really

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:84%
at the heart of what
we have to take on

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:84%
aside from the environmental
degradation, which we'll

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.800 align:middle line:84%
get into in a bit, about
our planet's health itself.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
How do we sustain
this number of people

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.645 align:middle line:84%
on a planet when we have a
severely declining opportunity

00:12:01.645 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:90%
rate for employment?

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well, just to answer
the last part of your question,

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that we do sustain
that many people on the planet.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Where we're heading is
not a pretty picture.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.685 align:middle line:90%
And the Earth may need to shed.

00:12:15.685 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't know.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.726 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a crystal ball.

00:12:17.726 --> 00:12:20.964 align:middle line:84%
But if we continue in
the way we're going,

00:12:20.964 --> 00:12:22.380 align:middle line:84%
the Earth is going
to need to shed

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of billion people,
several billion people perhaps.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I said earlier,
we can't live the way

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.475 align:middle line:90%
we're living on one planet.

00:12:32.475 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:84%
We would need 27 or
30 of them or more

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
to continue to do
what we're doing.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:90%
So we are up against our limits.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're a culture
of two-year-olds.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
face our limits.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And the universe,
life, is demanding

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.292 align:middle line:90%
that we do so right now.

00:12:50.292 --> 00:12:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I wonder.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've heard the
arguments every which way.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed so many
people on the topic of,

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:84%
are there are too many of us,
or is it just that we're not

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
acting intelligently enough
to all live here at this time?

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Because theoretically,
that's not

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
that many people for
this large a mass.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:84%
If we were living in
complete harmony with nature

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and able to utilize
clean, new technologies,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:84%
that wisdom combined
with technology

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.140 align:middle line:84%
actually could make
this a livable place.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.240 align:middle line:84%
But the way we're doing
business is like two-year-olds,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:90%
trashing the place.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: And so we need to get
people to change their living

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:90%
arrangements.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:90%
And that is really--

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that?

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
for a little bit.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like to you?

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've been studying
this for a long time.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.270 align:middle line:84%
What does a futuristic
living arrangement

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:43.314 align:middle line:84%
look like that is sustainable
long into the future?

00:13:43.314 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well,
again, I don't know

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:90%
that anything is sustainable.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to change
our living arrangements--

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure that we
have enough time to do that.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.130 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to
radically change them--

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.920 align:middle line:84%
it would mean downsizing
every aspect of our lives.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would be downsizing
the amount of people

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
we bring onto the planet,
downsizing our homes,

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:84%
our lifestyles, our
transportation, pretty much how

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
we do everything,
downsizing our use of energy

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and our involvement
with technology,

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.395 align:middle line:90%
downsizing how we grow our food.

00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every single aspect of
our lives would have to shrink.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.652 align:middle line:84%
And we would have to do
things much more locally

00:14:28.652 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and in community
with each other,

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
relying much more on each
other and human resources

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.485 align:middle line:84%
than technology and
things out there.

00:14:38.485 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I absolutely
agree with that.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
would be wise anyway.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think I've
been doing my own little blogs

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and lectures and writing about
that for the last several years

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:84%
as well, about the need to
start turning to each other,

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
certainly before the collapse
of the economy in 2008.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
That became a clear
indicator as people

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.740 align:middle line:84%
were being forced to move
back in with one another,

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's friend or family
by birth or not by birth,

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and helping each
other out again.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.955 align:middle line:84%
And where we complain
about this and feel

00:15:09.955 --> 00:15:12.750 align:middle line:84%
as though some entitlements
have been robbed of us,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I actually see this as a
really beautiful progression.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.625 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Oh, I do to.

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How would
you-- yeah, you do too.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: I totally
agree with that, yeah.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And if the idea of kids living
with their parents until

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.547 align:middle line:90%
their 35 or 40-- well--

00:15:26.547 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:27.963 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yeah.

00:15:27.963 --> 00:15:30.836 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at 200 years
ago, what people did.

00:15:30.836 --> 00:15:31.336 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:31.336 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:90%
It'd be much more sustainable.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and there
are some other interesting

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:90%
possibilities there.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we have
relations with each other

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:84%
that are not ideal, what
better way to start working it

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:84%
back out again when you're no
longer able to run and hide

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
necessarily, and you have to
stay there with each other

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and start working
through things.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: I think we're going
to be downsized anyway,

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:84%
just as things
continue to unravel.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be forced
to rely on each other.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things I
talk about a lot is, how do we

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:10.486 align:middle line:84%
communicate with each other
in loving and nonviolent ways?

00:16:10.486 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can turn
on National Geographic TV

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
anytime you want and
watch doomsday preppers.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And you know, lots
of people think

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:84%
that if they have beans and
bullets and a certain amount

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:84%
of weapons, they're
going to be just fine.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to get
70, 80 people together

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:90%
in a small living space.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I see that, I
think, and how are they

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:90%
going to get along?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they're coming from
this culture of entitlement,

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
this culture of narcissism
and individuality,

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
where people don't communicate
with each other in these ways

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:90%
to solve problems.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So I see that as a
potential nightmare.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And so what I try
to help people do

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of communicating with
each other about their needs.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:84%
My next book is going to be
coming out in 2015, early 2015.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's called "Love in the
Age of Ecological Apocalypse:

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.134 align:middle line:84%
the Relationships
We Need to Thrive."

00:17:01.134 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about it now.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
wait for your book.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: OK.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.983 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle line:90%
Because I agree.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed hundreds
and several hundred people

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.560 align:middle line:90%
like yourself.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And I've been exposed
to more information

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.670 align:middle line:84%
than most people need
to be exposed to.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, it comes down
to some very simple tenants

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and choices that require
a sense of maturity

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and internal discipline
and a level of compassion

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that has not been called forth
until this period of time.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yes, yes.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, as
you say maturity,

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I think of Andrew's phrase,
astringent maturity,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
in which we're going
to have to grow up.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're a culture of babies,
of really young thinking

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have to go
through some really difficult

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.880 align:middle line:84%
times, I believe, in
order to deepen ourselves

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle line:90%
and to really finish growing up.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And so in my next book, I
talk about how everything

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.255 align:middle line:90%
is a relationship, you know?

00:18:05.255 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I have a relationship with
this table and this cup.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I have a relationship with you.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I have a relationship
with my work, with money,

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:90%
with all of the ecosystems.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a relationship.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when we start
living that way,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:84%
it will profoundly
change how we relate

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:90%
to everything and everyone.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, for indigenous people,
when they were living mostly

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:84%
on this continent-- and
there were many more of them

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.495 align:middle line:90%
than there are now.

00:18:37.495 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:84%
The way most indigenous people
look at the rest of the Earth

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:84%
is they look, for example, at
the Flatirons here in Boulder.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.110 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.395 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Utes did look
at the Flatirons as people.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:90%
And they looked at this.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.926 align:middle line:90%
This is a being.

00:18:52.926 --> 00:18:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like
living entities, yes.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: A living entity with
whom I have a relationship.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:90%
My job is to care for it.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And they treated
everything that way.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Industrial civilization
and its paradigm

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:84%
comes along and
objectifies all of that.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:06.210 align:middle line:90%
It

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:90%
says, oh, mountain.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.472 align:middle line:90%
There must be resources there.

00:19:09.472 --> 00:19:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go there
and take those resources.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, if
you get there first,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I can kill you so that I
can have the resources.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you see how the
difference in relationship.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we are going
to have to learn

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.377 align:middle line:84%
to live in relationship
with everything

00:19:26.377 --> 00:19:27.460 align:middle line:90%
if we're going to survive.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
redefining our relationships

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:32.986 align:middle line:90%
with each other?

00:19:32.986 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Because that's another one.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're living in pretty
strict little boxes of how

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.690 align:middle line:84%
relationships look-- familial,
whether it's a lover,

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.140 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a friend,
whether it's a mate.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're in these
tiny little boxes

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.976 align:middle line:84%
that allow very little crossover
and freedom of expression

00:19:52.976 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
of compassion and
love and caring

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.599 align:middle line:84%
for anything that doesn't
exist within a box.

00:19:57.599 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about that
for a little while?

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yeah.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going
to, as I say--

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I believe that if we
begin to see everything

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:84%
as a relationship,
then we're going

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:84%
to be less likely
to be constrained

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.380 align:middle line:90%
by these little boxes.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we can
look at someone and say,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:84%
well, they're not
part of my family,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.357 align:middle line:90%
and they're not my lover.

00:20:20.357 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But I love them.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: But I love
them, absolutely.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:23.833 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And how to incorporate
that into life.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:90%
But again, that takes maturity.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Because then you have the
other members of the tribe.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Why is this person
being brought in?

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle line:84%
They're not your mate,
lover, or family.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Why are you bringing someone in?

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, this is happening
in subtle ways and not so subtle

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:90%
ways everywhere.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think our
entire species is

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:84%
trying to punch our
way out of that bag.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: I do, too.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And the way we develop maturity
is by going within ourselves

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and finding out
who we really are.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the two questions
that I am constantly

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
confronting people
with in my work

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:84%
is: as we face these
very daunting times--

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and I have no
assumption that we're

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
going to quote unquote
"survive" them.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a very
risky assumption.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.031 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what is your view?

00:21:11.031 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: But as we face these
daunting times, two questions

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
we must keep in
mind are, who am I?

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Who really am I?

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:90%
And what am I doing here?

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:90%
What is my purpose?

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And how can I serve?

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we're coming
down to a time where--

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and I've been using
this term more recently.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not in this book.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:90%
It'll be in my next book.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking a lot
about the possibility

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:84%
of our species, our planet,
being in a hospice situation.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you talk to people
who are hospice caretakers

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:84%
or you've known
people in hospice,

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.970 align:middle line:84%
sometimes what you find
out is that hospice is not

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:90%
the worst place to be.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Some people say
hospice before they

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:90%
die is the best time of my life.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The most
real place to be.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: I had a
quiet time to reflect.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I was able to make
amends to people

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.220 align:middle line:90%
I needed to make amends to.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I was able to really look
at the quality of some

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
of my relationships, the
good, the bad, the everything.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I was able to do some service in
my little community around me.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I was able to really
spend quality time

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:90%
at the end of my days.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it has been helpful
to me to look at myself

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and to encourage other
people to consider

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:84%
that we are in a hospice
situation, which as you said,

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.175 align:middle line:90%
is not a bad way to live anyway.

00:22:35.175 --> 00:22:36.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:36.175 --> 00:22:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: You know?

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
changes the question.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.230 align:middle line:84%
It changes the conversation
with each other.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:84%
You have in one of the
chapters in your book,

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:84%
someone who you were
quoting was commenting

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:84%
on how crass the question
is when you meet someone,

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
so what do you do
to earn a living?

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's sounds--
I hate that question.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:00.620 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a slave species
question to me, really.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about that
and what the new conversation

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.377 align:middle line:90%
should be looking like.

00:23:05.377 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yeah.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.418 align:middle line:84%
Well the new
conversation, I think,

00:23:07.418 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:90%
is much more about who are you?

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about you.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:90%
And what gives you joy?

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Where is your
passion, which might

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:84%
include what you do
in terms of your work.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It might include how
you earn a living.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.190 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we
need much more to be

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.630 align:middle line:84%
focusing on service
at this time.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many, many
millions of people out there

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.950 align:middle line:90%
who are unemployed.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're old enough that
they may never be employed again

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:90%
as we understand employment.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.772 align:middle line:84%
But they could certainly
be doing service.

00:23:40.772 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Many of them are.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and you're
talking about your soul's

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:84%
gift-- I mean, I think
that's the terminology you

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:84%
use throughout your
book-- is rather than

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:84%
what do you do to earn a
living so that you can afford

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to put food in your mouth
and stay out of the rain?

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.971 align:middle line:84%
That's as base as it gets
for humanity, really.

00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:57.220 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what you do.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Just asking that question, that
is-- what do you do to survive?

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
what do you do to thrive?

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:84%
As a soul, what is
your gift, right?

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: And what did
you come here to do?

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
you come here to do?

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so many
people who are now

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:84%
unemployed, or they've
gone through a lot

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
of different losses in this
different kinds of collapse,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:84%
are really looking
at, what is my gift?

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.110 align:middle line:90%
And they're finding their gifts.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're really feeling
much more fulfilled

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.360 align:middle line:84%
than when they were in the
golden handcuffs in the cubicle

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.180 align:middle line:84%
some place, earning
the so-called salary.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think you use
the term, funemployment.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yeah, there's one.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.071 align:middle line:90%
That's not my term.

00:24:33.071 --> 00:24:36.581 align:middle line:84%
But there is one woman who had
written an article about that.

00:24:36.581 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: About funemployment.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Funemployment,
yeah, yeah.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, you
know, this is a time--

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I often get accused of
being doom and gloom.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you read any of my
books and listen to me talking,

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:84%
my radio show and
various things that I do,

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:84%
you'll hear that I have a
tremendous emphasis on joy.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: How do we
create joy in our lives?

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.930 align:middle line:84%
How do we inflict
joy on other people?

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:84%
How do we create
beauty in our lives?

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And how do we stay
connected with nature?

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
we must be doing right

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.080 align:middle line:84%
now to balance out
the other emotions

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're having
around this descent.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you mention in the
book that part of this descent

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:84%
is we are no longer
living in any kind

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:84%
of natural or recognizable
sense of real community.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Right.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so talk
a little bit about this

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:84%
need that human beings have to
express their individuality,

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and yet the absolute
need to now start

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
coming together in community
so that we can, A, get

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.069 align:middle line:84%
through times of unemployment
in assisting each other

00:25:47.069 --> 00:25:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and taking care of
some of the basics

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.100 align:middle line:84%
that need to be done like
communal gardens and so forth.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Right, right.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:52.822 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:25:52.822 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:10%
As you were talking,
I was thinking

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.470 align:middle line:10%
of a little thing I saw on
Facebook the other day that

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.942 align:middle line:10%
just sent me really falling off
my chair with laughter almost.

00:26:02.942 --> 00:26:05.160 align:middle line:10%
A little saying that
said, introverts

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:10.390 align:middle line:10%
unite, in your own homes,
behind your own four walls.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I laughed, because
I tend to be an introvert.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But this isn't going
to work any longer.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:90%
We cannot survive alone.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
doomsday prepper is

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:84%
doomed before they get
out of the bomb shelter.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.290 align:middle line:90%
We have to have each other.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.100 align:middle line:90%
We desperately need to be seen.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to be appreciated
by each other.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Do we need our alone time?

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Do we need time
for contemplation

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and one-on-one connection
with nature and our beloveds,

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:90%
whoever they are?

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But we need to live in community
and really be seeing each other

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:50.997 align:middle line:90%
and working with each other.

00:26:50.997 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.260 align:middle line:84%
We need to be able to look
each other in the eye.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.676 align:middle line:84%
And that has become
something that

00:26:55.676 --> 00:26:58.546 align:middle line:84%
is intensely uncomfortable, I
think, for most human beings

00:26:58.546 --> 00:26:59.045 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:26:59.045 --> 00:26:59.878 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Absolutely.

00:26:59.878 --> 00:27:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I loved-- you know, I have
a life coaching practice.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And people are contacting
me all the time

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.710 align:middle line:84%
for various reasons that have
to do with this unraveling.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And people who are working
in community gardens, people

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:84%
who are doing projects together
in shareable communities

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and so forth are just
finding so much joy that they

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:90%
didn't realize was possible.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And it all started
because they were kind of

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:84%
pushed as a result of
various forms of collapse

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.250 align:middle line:90%
into being together.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what about the
notion, as I mentioned earlier

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:84%
in the show, of-- granted we
have to develop the wisdom.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:84%
No, the race to me isn't so much
against technology-- technology

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
against nature and
natural systems--

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:84%
it's against the wisdom
and the employment

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:52.485 align:middle line:90%
of certain technologies.

00:27:52.485 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So again, there are
technologies, for example,

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.846 align:middle line:90%
to mitigate almost everything.

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the oceans for a moment.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: OK.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know that's a
subject near and dear to you,

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:06.620 align:middle line:90%
the oceans.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
Fukushima for a moment.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
technologies that

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:84%
can mitigate a lot of the
damage that is being done

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and has been done.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.910 align:middle line:84%
There's been-- I mean, just
simply using natural organisms

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:84%
to clean up horribly toxic
spills into the land,

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.480 align:middle line:90%
into the earth, into the oceans.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:90%
All these things are possible.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.660 align:middle line:84%
But they're not being employed
to the extent that they should.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.520 align:middle line:84%
That's somewhere an unwise
choice at a high enough level

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.160 align:middle line:90%
where the money flows.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well, two
things-- yes, there

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:90%
are these many technologies.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And we could be doing
a lot of things.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:90%
There are two issues, however.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.890 align:middle line:84%
One is, do we have enough
time before we burn up

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:53.070 align:middle line:90%
this planet with our pollution?

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:84%
We've now passed 400 parts per
million in terms of carbon.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:84%
By the end of 2015,
most climate scientists

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.680 align:middle line:84%
are saying there won't
be any ice in the Arctic.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So do we have time to do
all of that technology?

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:90%
And then is there the will?

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And there won't be the will
unless there is the awakening

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.970 align:middle line:90%
to really look at the problem.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday, the United
States government

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:84%
came out with this huge
scary climate report.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.152 align:middle line:84%
Oh, climate change is real
and it's really affecting us

00:29:25.152 --> 00:29:26.526 align:middle line:84%
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:29:26.526 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A, they never
print anything real.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.900 align:middle line:84%
But if they do, they're going
to manipulate us somehow.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.204 align:middle line:84%
So was this just
another false report?

00:29:34.204 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think it was real,
but for a manipulation?

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well, let me say
before I answer that question,

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I think it was something like in
a CNN poll, 36% of people said,

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.120 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I heard the report.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.754 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think it's
going to affect me.

00:29:48.754 --> 00:29:49.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's this culture
of two-year-olds.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, this isn't
going to affect me.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I can continue
playing with my toys.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this is going
to affect somebody else.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.980 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there's-- I had to
wonder when this announcement

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.500 align:middle line:84%
was made what's up the sleeve
of the US government that

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.215 align:middle line:84%
it's making this announcement
at this particular time.

00:30:12.215 --> 00:30:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fair, yeah.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: You know, is
the next thing going

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.329 align:middle line:84%
to be, well, so we have
to have geoengineering?

00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's now a polite
term for chemtrails, too.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yes, of course.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Or is the next
thing going to be,

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.260 align:middle line:84%
we have to have these
limits on your life?

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:84%
We have to have
more surveillance.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:28.810 align:middle line:90%
We have to this.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:29.680 align:middle line:90%
We have to that.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.221 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, of
course, that's going

00:30:31.221 --> 00:30:33.450 align:middle line:84%
to require-- the geoengineering
requires genetically

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.262 align:middle line:84%
modified seed stocks
as well, of course.

00:30:36.262 --> 00:30:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they can't
grow otherwise, right?

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:39.469 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: And so we
have to have more

00:30:39.469 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:90%
drones in your neighborhood.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do we have to
wait a little while to see what

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:84%
the follow-up story is
to figure that one out?

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.773 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have some
thoughts yourself on it?

00:30:49.773 --> 00:30:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well, I mean, I just
basically shared with you

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.830 align:middle line:90%
what my thoughts are.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And I have no faith that
this report means anything

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
they are going to do.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But it does, however,
mean a great deal

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:07.050 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how much
time we may not have.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you know,
we're at a point

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.350 align:middle line:84%
now that human beings
have never been

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.800 align:middle line:90%
at in terms of the climate.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.810 align:middle line:90%
Ever.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:14.480 align:middle line:90%
It's far beyond.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we've
been through extinctions.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: We've been
through extinctions.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've been
through ice ages.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.600 align:middle line:84%
We've been through
all the above.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.016 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: And I believe that
we're approaching another one.

00:31:21.016 --> 00:31:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people
would say, well,

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be a massive
change in consciousness,

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.210 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.505 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:31:28.505 --> 00:31:30.035 align:middle line:90%
I don't see that happening.

00:31:30.035 --> 00:31:31.260 align:middle line:90%
I could be wrong.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Hope I'm wrong, you know?

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.310 align:middle line:84%
But there has to be the
will to look at the problem

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.640 align:middle line:90%
and take the steps.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, do we have time?

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not
sure that we do.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that leaves a lot
of people feeling depressed,

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.130 align:middle line:84%
of course, the notion that
there's not enough time.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And this might roll out pocket
to pocket around the planet,

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.220 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.112 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: I would just say
to those depressed folks,

00:31:58.112 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, hospice
is a busy place.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:04.370 align:middle line:10%
I wrote an article on
that a couple months ago.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:10%
If you go to my website you
can find it-- carolynbaker.net.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.870 align:middle line:10%
Hospice is a busy place.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.390 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to do in hospice.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.595 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of fun
to be had in hospice.

00:32:12.595 --> 00:32:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Um, you always know
why you're there.

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately, like
I said, life is fatal.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.360 align:middle line:90%
No one gets out of here alive.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.450 align:middle line:84%
But you can have a hell of
a good time in the meantime.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.090 align:middle line:90%
You can experience a lot of joy.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.770 align:middle line:84%
You can make a lot of
difference in people's lives.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.050 align:middle line:84%
You can experience
and express compassion

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.120 align:middle line:90%
like you never have before.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can have some
of the best quality

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.704 align:middle line:90%
relationships imaginable.

00:32:38.704 --> 00:32:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look
at it again through

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.790 align:middle line:90%
the Native American lens.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Because to them, when we
go through these periods,

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.550 align:middle line:84%
periodically, as a human--
as the whole entire species,

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.800 align:middle line:84%
as we go through these
purifications, which

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.790 align:middle line:84%
is how they view it, they
see great opportunity

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:59.100 align:middle line:84%
in these periods where
everything, every cell

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.707 align:middle line:90%
goes through a life and a death.

00:33:00.707 --> 00:33:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: That's what
my book is about.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:03.873 align:middle line:84%
That's what all of
my books are about.

00:33:03.873 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Is what is the
opportunity here for

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.770 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, emotional,
physical total growth

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.992 align:middle line:90%
and transformation?

00:33:11.992 --> 00:33:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And care share
the indigenous point of view

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:90%
on this cycle of time?

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: I don't know that I'm
that familiar with the finer

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.940 align:middle line:84%
points of the Mayan calendar
and that sort of thing.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But I certainly am somewhat
familiar with the Hopi point

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.120 align:middle line:84%
of view, which you
live not so far from,

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that this is a
great purification.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going through
a great purification.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.750 align:middle line:90%
It will be painful.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:40.660 align:middle line:84%
But the purification is
necessary for the Earth,

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.580 align:middle line:90%
for the species.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I say near
term extinction,

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.526 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe for one moment
that every single human life

00:33:47.526 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:90%
is going to be snuffed out.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:50.796 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: I believe
there will be pockets

00:33:50.796 --> 00:33:53.310 align:middle line:90%
of people who will survive.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:84%
What they will do with that
survival and that opportunity,

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.210 align:middle line:84%
But I know they will be
changed and transformed

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.460 align:middle line:90%
people as a result.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about nature.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:07.090 align:middle line:84%
We've talked-- you know that
this is the big argument.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.909 align:middle line:84%
There are two very
distinct camps of people.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:12.580 align:middle line:84%
One is that all
the problems we're

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:84%
having are a direct result of
our interface with the planet,

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.440 align:middle line:84%
disrespectful interface
with the planet,

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.010 align:middle line:90%
over consumption, et cetera.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's a very good point.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:28.610 align:middle line:84%
We are guilty as
accused on those counts.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.460 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
the other camp

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.739 align:middle line:84%
will argue that there are
these cyclical disruptions.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:36.360 align:middle line:84%
As I just mentioned
a little bit ago,

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.310 align:middle line:84%
there are ice ages followed by
warming periods and so forth.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's natural for any
organism, including the Earth

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.710 align:middle line:84%
herself, to go through
these processes

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.460 align:middle line:84%
where it sheds a little bit
of some of the life forms

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:90%
that are there.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they start being
reestablished again.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.290 align:middle line:90%
And new ones are established.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Other ones die away.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just life.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.250 align:middle line:90%
That's just the cycle of life.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.720 align:middle line:90%
That's another argument.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would argue it's a
combination of the two.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Because even if there are larger
cycles that are in play right

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.760 align:middle line:84%
now that will determine
what the future course is

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.270 align:middle line:84%
for all of humanity
on this planet

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and for its other life
forms, at the same time,

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't give
us carte blanche

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:25.660 align:middle line:84%
to essentially trash
this planet that we have.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.597 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: It comes back to
the issue of relationship.

00:35:28.597 --> 00:35:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.115 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: If I have a
relationship with this planet

00:35:32.115 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and with those mountains and
those rivers and those beings,

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to do everything
I can to take care of them.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And another thing, as we
face this huge decline

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:47.420 align:middle line:84%
in the ecosystem, one of the
things I'm talking about a lot

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.845 align:middle line:90%
is having good manners.

00:35:49.845 --> 00:35:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about manners.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:52.220 align:middle line:90%
They're important.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Having good
manners and making

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:58.860 align:middle line:84%
it as easy for other species
in this decline as possible.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And being respectful, because
we love the Earth, not saying,

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.270 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, it's a cycle.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'll just kick
back and have some more of this

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.560 align:middle line:90%
and do some more of that.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But rather, I have this heart
connection with the planet.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And it hurts my heart
to see this decline.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want to do
everything I can

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:24.797 align:middle line:84%
to make it easy on you and
everyone as we go through it.

00:36:24.797 --> 00:36:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
those two positions

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.750 align:middle line:90%
are not mutually exclusive.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:90%
We can acknowledge large cycles.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:90%
They happen.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Warming, cooling happens.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But we also have to acknowledge
our part in what we're doing.

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Because our part has
more to-- extends more

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.690 align:middle line:84%
to things like Fukushima,
being irresponsible

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:84%
in our understanding
of nuclear energy

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and the effects of using
that type of nuclear energy

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and totally, blindly
ignoring warning signs

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.540 align:middle line:90%
that had been there all along.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is nuclear energy
plants around the planet.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
leakage going on that's

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.420 align:middle line:90%
never talked about, for example.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.020 align:middle line:84%
This is just a complete
lack of wisdom.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.782 align:middle line:84%
And it's just wrong
thinking and greed combined.

00:37:07.782 --> 00:37:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: It's the culture of
two-year-olds, again, who say,

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.000 align:middle line:90%
I want my lifestyle.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I want my things, my stuff.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.220 align:middle line:90%
And I will do whatever it takes.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And I will turn a blind eye to
the danger of nuclear energy.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And oh, if there are 30-year-old
nuclear power plants, 140

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.950 align:middle line:84%
of them or whatever
in this country,

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're all sitting
accidents waiting to happen,

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:31.700 align:middle line:90%
so what?

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:36.670 align:middle line:84%
I will do whatever I need
to do to have what I want.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it's with that
mentality that we went into it.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was living
in southern New Mexico

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.955 align:middle line:84%
and there was talk
of this waste site,

00:37:47.955 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, the WIPP
site in Carlsbad.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And many of the people and other
activists that I was involved

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.672 align:middle line:90%
with were saying, oh, my god.

00:37:56.672 --> 00:37:57.880 align:middle line:90%
We don't want this, you know?

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a terrible thing.

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be really
careful how we build this.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And so this place was
kind of thrown together.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And now we've had a
huge accident there.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in every
one of these incidents,

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.510 align:middle line:84%
we're not getting
told the whole truth.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.740 align:middle line:84%
We never are getting
told the whole truth.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, a brave
little soul came out.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:17.550 align:middle line:90%
I saw it on YouTube.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.225 align:middle line:90%
Has to be real, right?

00:38:19.225 --> 00:38:22.520 align:middle line:84%
It's from a former official
at the Daiichi plant,

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.910 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:26.510 align:middle line:90%
I hope I'm not misstating that.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was someone in official
capacity in Japan saying,

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.760 align:middle line:84%
they're not telling
you the truth.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking about what
was happening to their children

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.660 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Leukemia severely on the rise.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Heart condition
severely on the rise.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Their population into the
future has been ravaged.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Yes,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing some of the
effects of this showing up

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.820 align:middle line:84%
in the Pacific Coast of the
United States and Canada.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
website called

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.650 align:middle line:90%
ENE News-- E as in energy.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.170 align:middle line:90%
ENE News, which reports--

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dot com?

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Yeah-- which reports
on Fukushima daily, pretty

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:90%
much daily.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.096 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know you're
very dialed into that.

00:39:10.096 --> 00:39:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what you know and what
you've garnered from that.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well, you know, there's
quite a bit of following up

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.130 align:middle line:84%
on what is going on with some
of the wildlife in the Pacific,

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:23.146 align:middle line:84%
along the Pacific
coast, sea lions, seals.

00:39:23.146 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is going on?

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what's going on.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: A lot are dying.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And many of these sea
creatures are moving in closer.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.940 align:middle line:84%
They're moving in closer to
the coast than they ever have.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
kind of staying there

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:39.520 align:middle line:84%
as if they don't want to
go out into deeper waters.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.810 align:middle line:90%
That's being studied.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
anything conclusive.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:49.500 align:middle line:84%
There's some radiation from
some mechanism from Fukushima

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.350 align:middle line:84%
that I read this morning on
ENE News that has shown up

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:56.580 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, which is going
the other direction.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think the most
chilling thing--

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.580 align:middle line:84%
no pun intended-- but the most
chilling thing that I have

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.470 align:middle line:84%
heard about Fukushima
lately, which

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.310 align:middle line:84%
relates to all nuclear
power all over the world,

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.120 align:middle line:84%
is that we're going
to have this collapse.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.360 align:middle line:90%
It's in process.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.470 align:middle line:90%
We are collapsing industrially.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:18.622 align:middle line:90%
And that will play out.

00:40:18.622 --> 00:40:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how long
that will play out.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:25.345 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people kind of are
cheerleading and saying, yay,

00:40:25.345 --> 00:40:26.095 align:middle line:90%
bring on collapse.

00:40:26.095 --> 00:40:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And I used to be
one of those people.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's help it.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Help it along.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:35.040 align:middle line:84%
However, what the collapse
of industrial civilization

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.570 align:middle line:84%
ultimately means is the end
of power, the end of energy,

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:40.700 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
when the grid goes down

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:47.550 align:middle line:84%
is 400 or more
nuclear power plants

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:51.640 align:middle line:84%
around the world start
going into meltdown.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So I look at this and I
say that perhaps humanity

00:40:55.230 --> 00:41:00.130 align:middle line:84%
is between the worst rock and
a hard place we've ever been.

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a time for deep
transformation, a deep clearing

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:11.130 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, a
deep spiritual rebirth,

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:14.200 align:middle line:90%
despite whatever the outcome is.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I certainly
understand what you're saying.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.590 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with you.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds as
though-- I mean,

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:84%
now we're getting into
some of the finer, more

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:25.505 align:middle line:84%
esoteric aspects of what we
as souls can do at this time.

00:41:25.505 --> 00:41:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.250 align:middle line:84%
If we haven't acted
wisely up to this point

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:34.490 align:middle line:84%
in the physical world in
changing these realities,

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.390 align:middle line:90%
there is always time.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.830 align:middle line:84%
There's always time
to do what you can,

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.670 align:middle line:84%
to mitigate what you can,
to demand what you can.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Because some things
can be forestalled.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Some of things can
be averted even.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Other things, I think, some
situations-- you're right--

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.880 align:middle line:84%
are probably beyond
the point of no return.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And it seems, as a
soul though, one thing

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:58.397 align:middle line:84%
every single being can do
is put their heart out.

00:41:58.397 --> 00:41:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Absolutely.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can put our
heart out there and start

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:07.140 align:middle line:84%
connecting with those species,
for example, those species who

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.770 align:middle line:84%
have lived in these
oceans for millions

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:11.260 align:middle line:84%
of years who are being
impacted by the radiation.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.100 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing stopping us
from taking a moment or two

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and putting our
heart out to them.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yes, yes.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And physically helping, if
we can, if there's some way

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.040 align:middle line:90%
that we can do that.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:23.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not too late.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.760 align:middle line:84%
The point-- it's never too
late to start doing something.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: That's exactly right.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As bad as
the situation looks,

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:29.760 align:middle line:90%
it's not too late.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yes.

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:31.730 align:middle line:90%
And you do it for yourself.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.310 align:middle line:90%
And you do it for the other.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, also, you say within
this, we have to create beauty.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.097 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:42:42.097 --> 00:42:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Sure.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.138 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
one of the things

00:42:44.138 --> 00:42:45.940 align:middle line:84%
that has disappeared
from modern culture

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:49.080 align:middle line:84%
is any support for
the arts, for example.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have to start bringing
our creative forces back again.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just for
the art itself, but for what

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.040 align:middle line:84%
that does to us as a
species of bringing up

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.670 align:middle line:90%
other creative potential.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to talk
about that for a moment.

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well, you know, the
arts are very related to ritual

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and very related
to spirituality.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.460 align:middle line:90%
They come from that place.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.100 align:middle line:84%
All creativity comes from that
deeper, deeper well within us,

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.930 align:middle line:90%
our core, our divine self.

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And so there's not going
to be probably a lot

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.790 align:middle line:84%
of institutional support
for the arts right now.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But we have to support
them within our own sphere

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.000 align:middle line:84%
of influence, with
our own creativity,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.690 align:middle line:90%
within our communities.

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:39.046 align:middle line:84%
And we have to really
do whatever we can.

00:43:39.046 --> 00:43:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we don't have
to do elaborate things.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've seen
"The Landfill Harmonic" that

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:46.420 align:middle line:90%
was on PBS--

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: --where there's this
wonderful group of people

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.630 align:middle line:84%
in a small little town up
in the mountains of Peru

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.160 align:middle line:90%
who take trash.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.110 align:middle line:84%
They go down to the
recycling place.

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:58.550 align:middle line:90%
And they take trash.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And they make these
instrument.s And just

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:06.299 align:middle line:84%
Google landfill, Landfill
Harmonic, Landfill Harmonic.

00:44:06.299 --> 00:44:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They make
instruments out of the trash?

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:08.881 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yes.

00:44:08.881 --> 00:44:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And they have created this
amazing symphony orchestra

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.790 align:middle line:84%
that sounds like the
New York Philharmonic.

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:17.872 align:middle line:84%
And they play this
incredible classical music

00:44:17.872 --> 00:44:20.650 align:middle line:84%
on these instruments
made from trash.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Yeah, it's
really amazing.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and when
we start re-inspiring,

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:31.049 align:middle line:84%
re-invigorating our entire being
through any creative endeavor--

00:44:31.049 --> 00:44:31.840 align:middle line:90%
It can be anything.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.010 align:middle line:84%
It could be right
brain, left brain.

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:33.940 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Any creative endeavor at
all, any act of beauty--

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.252 align:middle line:84%
it starts bringing out an innate
power that we don't have access

00:44:41.252 --> 00:44:43.460 align:middle line:84%
to as a species right now,
because we're sleepwalking

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.622 align:middle line:90%
and trying to survive.

00:44:44.622 --> 00:44:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the other
beauties of unemployment

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:48.380 align:middle line:84%
that you were speaking
about earlier.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:49.210 align:middle line:90%
We have a chance.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.090 align:middle line:84%
We have the time to
actually access this.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I can't
overstate it enough.

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:59.450 align:middle line:84%
If we can find that little spark
of creativity in ourselves,

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:03.370 align:middle line:84%
we have a whole lot of
more potential solutions

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:04.890 align:middle line:90%
on our hands to these problems.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.816 align:middle line:84%
But not when you
can't even think.

00:45:06.816 --> 00:45:07.815 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Right, exactly.

00:45:07.815 --> 00:45:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we can find that
spark of creativity,

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:14.500 align:middle line:84%
we can find more compassion
and more connection.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And so beauty-- were talking
about bringing beauty

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.660 align:middle line:90%
in in all forms.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.070 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
bringing art back.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.772 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
bringing music back.

00:45:24.772 --> 00:45:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: And joy.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And joy.

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:27.537 align:middle line:90%
Storytelling.

00:45:27.537 --> 00:45:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Absolutely.

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I tell a story with
an African drum.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere I go and any
workshops that I do,

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:33.920 align:middle line:90%
I tell stories.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that gets us
out of the left brain

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and gets us into the
body and the heart.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:42.107 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what about simple
things like cooking together?

00:45:42.107 --> 00:45:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Absolutely.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Eating together
as families and groups

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.440 align:middle line:84%
again, just bringing nourishment
in in the company of people

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.460 align:middle line:84%
you love instead of
woofing down a burger

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.820 align:middle line:84%
in the car between
meetings brings,

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.260 align:middle line:84%
again, a whole different
kind of potential for-- well,

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.100 align:middle line:90%
I'd say rapport.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.516 align:middle line:84%
You'd call it
relationship, right?

00:45:59.516 --> 00:46:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Exactly, exactly.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.969 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts
before we sign off here?

00:46:03.969 --> 00:46:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well, can I read
something from the book

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:06.550 align:middle line:90%
just briefly?

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would love it.

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Read some things.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:84%
You have some beautiful
poetry in there.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:10.496 align:middle line:84%
I love the little one
from Helen Keller.

00:46:10.496 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:90%
But we couldn't find that.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Well, I just want
to close with this little bit

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.044 align:middle line:84%
of Rumi, and just a
short little piece--

00:46:17.044 --> 00:46:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and
Andrew and Rumi.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKER: Me and
Andrew and Rumi, yeah.

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But he says, "This we have
now is not an imagination.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:32.240 align:middle line:10%
This is not grief or joy, not
a judging state or an elation

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.620 align:middle line:10%
or sadness.

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.260 align:middle line:10%
Those come and go.

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.430 align:middle line:10%
This is the presence
that doesn't."

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that presence
that doesn't come and go,

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that's what we have the
opportunity to connect with now

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.670 align:middle line:90%
as we never have before.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:52.200 align:middle line:90%
And stay with that thread.

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, truer
words were never spoken.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:47:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very wise way of
handling this, you and Andrew

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and the other handful of
people who are also out there,

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:06.110 align:middle line:84%
not just saying, oh, my
god, the sky is falling,

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:07.377 align:middle line:90%
but saying the sky is falling.

00:47:07.377 --> 00:47:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But let's do something
really beautiful with that.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.502 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: Yes, absolutely.

00:47:10.502 --> 00:47:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A different
quality of message.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Carolyn.

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKER: You're welcome.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.102 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:47:15.102 --> 00:47:17.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: This is a very
adult approach to the times.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.290 align:middle line:10%
And you can move deeper into
the poetry and philosophy of it

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:23.130 align:middle line:10%
by picking up a copy of
"Collapsing Consciously."

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
