00:00:27.686 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Amidst
all of the messages

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:10%
we're bombarded with, there
are simple truths that

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:10%
withstand the test of time.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that these
words are historically

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:90%
from society's philosophers.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.882 align:middle line:84%
Our world no longer honors
philosophers, but I do.

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to
be speaking with one

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.760 align:middle line:84%
of the best, steeped in
the greatest traditions

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:90%
of the world, Steven Ross.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Steven is going to share his
wisdom about alchemy, which

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:90%
is a very much misused term.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we see this-- you can
even see in advertising, having

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
to do with beauty products
now, the word alchemy

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:90%
is all over the place.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Which really is kind of--
the plot has been lost.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.967 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair to say?

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVEN ROSS: I would
say that's very fair.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:10%
And it really leads
us into a subject

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:10%
that I think is
very, very important.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:10%
And that is when you look at
terminology from ancient times,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:10%
from past
civilizations, and they

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:10%
use words that are relatively
close to the words we use,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:10%
the difference really
is astronomical.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:10%
As an example, in ancient
times, the word magic

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:10%
meant one who understood
the workings of nature.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, magic has that
connotation of being-- it

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.570 align:middle line:84%
could be black magic, it could
be very, very mysterious.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But the magi, the magician,
was very highly thought of,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:90%
because they understood.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.830 align:middle line:84%
We will get into
another term that really

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:84%
is associated with
the alchemists,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
word imagination.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.559 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going to spend a
little time in that realm.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Because that's very different
in today's parlance as well.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Definitely.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Going back
to the term alchemy,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
back in the day, when people
used their language very

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:84%
carefully and had a completely
different understanding of it

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
than an chemical
marriage between

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:84%
say, two elements to
make a finer beauty

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.525 align:middle line:90%
product, for example.

00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what their
lifestyle was at the time.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Because as you've told me off
camera, this was a lifestyle.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy was an actual way
of living for these men.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That is very true.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, also in alchemy, I
include the term theurgy,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:84%
which was a practice
of the ancient Greeks.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Because alchemy is
looking for a change

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:90%
of state, a transformation.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:10%
So when we talk
about alchemy, I want

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:10%
to include a couple of other
regimens that are so close.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:10%
What the ancients were trying
to do through the term alchemy

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:10%
was to blend opposites
to achieve a oneness.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:90%
And that sounds very simplistic.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And it is simplistic, because
they said alchemy was using art

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:90%
to perfect nature.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It is speeding up
a natural process

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.310 align:middle line:84%
through the use of
the art, alchemy,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.700 align:middle line:90%
to achieve a something.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, you and I spoke
recently, again, off camera,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.070 align:middle line:84%
leading to this show, that
we live in a fast food era.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And the word alchemy
now really means

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.040 align:middle line:84%
somebody is going to find the
magic elixir, that magic rod,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
the Philosopher's
Stone, and they

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
are going to have all knowledge,
all wisdom, all abilities

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:90%
to do everything.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a modern day
word of use of the word magic,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's correct.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.270 align:middle line:10%
And in looking back,
my understanding

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:10%
is when you look at the
ancient philosophers who

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:10%
practiced either
alchemy or theurgy--

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:10%
and I should really
define theurgy.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:10%
Theurgy, as used by the
Greeks, was individuals

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.570 align:middle line:10%
who placed themselves in
position, through their actions

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:10%
and their thoughts,
that they would

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:10%
be a mirror to the
higher spheres,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.910 align:middle line:10%
to the gods and
goddesses or God.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.450 align:middle line:10%
So in other words, they would be
acting godlike on this planet,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.760 align:middle line:10%
and they would draw those forces
down from the higher spheres.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.030 align:middle line:84%
They would be a mirror of the
grander part of the universe.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was not
something that just happened

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:90%
with the snap of a finger.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
This was something
that was a practice.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:90%
It was a philosophy of life.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:10%
It was an individual living
the life of an alchemist, which

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:10%
would mean an individual who was
working at achieving something.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these
philosophers will tell you,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:84%
they were years and
years to accomplish it.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Many of them didn't reach it.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But the ones who did
always would say,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
either an individual or
wisdom herself came to them,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:90%
and then everything opened up.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So we are going to continue
with this conversation,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and I will get into what does it
mean living the chemical life,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:55.070 align:middle line:84%
so that people will understand
it isn't some magical device

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:90%
or object that you find.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:10%
It is a change of state
where an individual so

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:10%
transforms themself, they
transcend the physical self.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:10%
That they reach a
very high state.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what I'm
understanding out of that,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
as you were saying toward
the beginning of it,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.690 align:middle line:84%
it's almost as though
they're finding

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.875 align:middle line:90%
the resolution to duality.

00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: That is-- when you
look at the various chemical

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.540 align:middle line:84%
paintings and graphs
that they have,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
it is always showing this
combination of opposites.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Bringing the opposites together.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, in alchemical
terms-- and you

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
have to remember,
in those days, they

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
did not have the words for
unconscious, conscious,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
subconscious, so
there were terms

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that were used as a
parlance of the day

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
to try to explain this
combining of opposites.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
That is really the alchemical
way, the hermetic marriage,

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:84%
the masculine and the
feminine within an individual.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:10%
Now again, most of your
listeners are very, very savvy,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:10%
and they understand
that within a male,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:10%
you do have the feminine
nature, you have a masculine.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:10%
And in the female,
it is the same.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:10%
It is this combining
of these opposites,

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:10%
becoming one, that aligns
an individual to the higher

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:10%
precepts, the greater
wisdom that is there.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:10%
But again, it is a practice.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:10%
It is a lifestyle.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to jump all the way
ahead to someone-- Ralph Waldo

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.740 align:middle line:10%
Emerson, who is more of a
modern day philosopher, who

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:10%
spoke about self-reliance.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:middle line:84%
It is-- those alchemists did not
depend on some outside source.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:90%
They did not have their gurus.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.530 align:middle line:84%
They had people they admired,
but they had to do the work.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And the true alchemists
did the work.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is different
than having secrets

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.070 align:middle line:84%
passed on to you, which is
only a stage in the process.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go into that,
because the notion of secrecy

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:90%
has become a hot topic.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Because we feel as though
our privacy's being

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
invaded on many levels
in this modern era,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
because of technology
and so forth.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
But then if you go further into
the conspiracy communities,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:84%
anything having
to do with secrecy

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:84%
is inherently negative
or evil or there's

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:90%
a controlling elite behind it.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Yet that was really critical
to the great teachings

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:90%
in the time.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to take some
time explaining this to us.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.090 align:middle line:84%
What was originally intended
all the way through the times

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:90%
to today?

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Is it still relevant to have
these great, deep wisdoms

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:90%
shared or kept secret?

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I'm going to
start with an analogy that

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:90%
is a little biblical.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it's a lot biblical.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Moses goes up to the mountain.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to
visualize Charlton Heston,

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.825 align:middle line:90%
because it's all we see here.

00:09:14.825 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He cut a great
Moses on the screen.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.574 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's right.

00:09:17.574 --> 00:09:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So Moses goes up
to the mountain.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:84%
He's talking to
the burning bush.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:90%
He gets all this knowledge.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
He's aligned with
the wisdom of God.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.300 align:middle line:84%
He ends up with a white
beard and white hair.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:90%
He comes down from the mountain.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.370 align:middle line:90%
He goes to the pharaoh.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Let my people go.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So he has his brother Aaron
cast his rod on the ground,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:90%
and it turns into a snake.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It was a white snake.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people would go,
ooh, that was really something.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
But the pharaoh was
really not moved.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.500 align:middle line:84%
He tells his magicians to
cast their staves down.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:90%
They turned into three snakes.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, going by the movie,
so people can visualize,

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:90%
there were three black snakes.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
They were bigger
than the white snake,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:84%
but Moses' white snake slowly
swallowed all the other snakes.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the pharaoh's
court, then they went, ooh.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.370 align:middle line:90%
What is that telling us?

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.840 align:middle line:84%
What it's telling
us is the following.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:84%
There is an energy that is
available to all people,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.050 align:middle line:84%
whether it is positive
or less than positive.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
a high mucky muck.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
spiritually evolved.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:90%
They did the same thing.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Their energy is there for
all use and for everybody.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Now, back to your question.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Why the secrecy at the time?

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
The secrecy was not
everybody understood that.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it was kept
more of a secret,

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:05.740 align:middle line:84%
because if everybody realized
that they had this ability,

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:84%
not everybody was schooled
in high enough ethics

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
to use it properly.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I am not so sure, and I
don't mean to be judgmental,

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know, in today's
society, how many people would

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:84%
be schooled to also use some of
this knowledge in the highest,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:90%
most ethical, loving manner.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It is used
because it exists.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:10%
It is used because when an
individual like Walt Disney

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:10%
decides, someday there's going
to be a Disneyland, he's using,

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:10%
quote, "the secret," which
is really not a secret,

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:10%
that the law of
attraction is there.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So these ancients felt this
was so powerful that they just

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
didn't want anybody
doing it unless they went

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:90%
into the whole mystery school.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, that mystery school was
not like a 24 hour school

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:90%
that you went in and out.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, it
was a lifetime process.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.296 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It was a
lifetime process.

00:12:06.296 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
That even Pythagoras,
the great philosopher,

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.980 align:middle line:84%
had to sit in front of temples
in Egypt for years and years

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
until they finally said,
maybe this guy's serious.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:90%
This is Pythagoras.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he's serious, and
we're going to let him in.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
It is a philosophy of
life where an individual

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:84%
is really schooled in how
to use the higher regimes

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:90%
in the highest and best manner.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's the answer
to your first question,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:90%
why the secrecy.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we want to
continue on that tack,

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:90%
is there a need for that today?

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, really not, because
the secret is out.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:90%
It is there.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It has always been there.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Even though there
were mystery schools,

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.052 align:middle line:84%
and these people were
threatened that they would die--

00:13:01.052 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
Socrates in a moment, too.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they were under the threat
of death to reveal the secrets.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.905 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It was death.

00:13:06.905 --> 00:13:09.130 align:middle line:84%
But let's get right
into Socrates.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Socrates could
reveal some of it,

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.530 align:middle line:84%
because he never
took the sacred vow.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:84%
He did not go to
a mystery school.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:10%
And so he was revealing,
through his speech

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.850 align:middle line:10%
and Plato's writing-- because
Socrates did not write,

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:31.100 align:middle line:10%
but the Socratic dialogues was
written by his disciple, Plato.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:10%
But yes, he was revealing some
of these very, very important

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:10%
precepts.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And that may be a
little bit down the line

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:84%
from where we are of what were
they really teaching there.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But what we want to really lay
as a groundwork, Regina, is

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.250 align:middle line:84%
that it wasn't a quick, you're
going to find the answer.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a magical note,
that when it's played,

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden you have
instant enlightenment.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.709 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't work like that.

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And some of these mystery
schools, in various forms,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
some truer to the original
purpose than others,

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.490 align:middle line:90%
still exist.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:84%
There are still people studying
these very pure ancient tenets.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But I would like
you to make comment

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:84%
on that, because you
see mystery school here,

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.230 align:middle line:84%
mystery school there, that's
not what we're talking

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:90%
about in a lot of cases.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And help people understand
what the difference

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:84%
may be when you see
an advertised "mystery

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:84%
school" of one kind or
another versus genuine schools

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:84%
of the tenets for life,
the understanding of life.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: You have a
term called esoteric,

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:10%
which is the internal, and
exoteric, which is the outer.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.340 align:middle line:10%
The original Rosicrucians,
as an example,

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:10%
was a secret organization where
virtually none of the members

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:10%
were known, and it was
by invitation only.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, you have Rosicrucianism
in several different places,

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:10%
where people can sign
up, they are admitted,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:10%
they take courses.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not picking
on Rosicrucianism,

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm just commenting that a
lot of these original schools,

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
individuals had to
prove themselves

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and were invited to partake
in some of this wisdom.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Going back at the
School of Crotona,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
which was Pythagoras'
school around 500 BC,

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
it was a whole
curriculum of activities.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:84%
But he just didn't admit anybody
who signed up and paid a fee.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.940 align:middle line:84%
He really looked
at the individual,

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.960 align:middle line:84%
to the extent that
he would make jokes

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:84%
to see how the
individual laughed,

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
how the individual walked,
how the individual spoke,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:84%
how the individual
carried themselves

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:90%
under various situations.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he
had a background

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that he expected
mathematics and rhetoric

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:90%
to be part of their background.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But he analyzed, is this
individual male or female?

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And he was way
ahead of his time,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:22.710 align:middle line:84%
because women were treated
equally in his school.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.730 align:middle line:84%
He also had something
that was fascinating,

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
which was levels in his Academy
where students could not

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:84%
speak for either three
or five years, which

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
meant they had to listen
to all of the teaching

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.770 align:middle line:84%
without commenting,
without debating.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Five years for
their highest quote,

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:84%
"initiates," so that they would
take in everything before they

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:90%
would start arguing a point.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
This is underlying what
our conversation up to now

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:84%
has been about, and that
is, it is a lifestyle.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:90%
It is a philosophy of life.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, somebody can join
quote, this "mystery school"

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:84%
because Mr. or Mrs. X
says, "I am teaching

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom of the ages.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:90%
This is the mystery school.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:90%
This is what you pay.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
This is what you're
going to get.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can take level two
and level four and level six,

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to slowly
bring you to this point

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
where you are going to
have this great awareness."

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:84%
The fallacies that I
have found, and this

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.030 align:middle line:84%
is my understanding
and only my opinion,

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:84%
is that very few of
these people who've

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:84%
graduated from any
of these schools

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:84%
is any different
than anybody else

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:90%
who attends a beautiful school.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:90%
A music school, an art school.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:84%
These people who are attending
these mystery schools, what

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:90%
are they doing?

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Even the teachers
who are teaching.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I have been in this
field for 40 years.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:84%
I've been on the podiums
with a lot of people

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:90%
who have written these books.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.182 align:middle line:84%
And they have one
persona to the public,

00:18:12.182 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and then they have
another persona, where

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.630 align:middle line:90%
they're telling me, oh my gosh.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going under,
financially strapped.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But moments before, they're
teaching financial prosperity

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:90%
and financial consciousness.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
an incoherence.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And this is
going to be a keynote

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:90%
of my sharing with you.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:90%
It is the word integrity.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:90%
It is an integrity of being.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
What you talk about
is how you walk.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:10%
What you say is how you act.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to define that as
either being in integrity

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:90%
or being out of integrity.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's a very
practical description of what

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:90%
integrity is for all of us.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can understand that.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, we
seem to give a pass to it

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:84%
with the spiritual community
and the religious community.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you know, so and so,
Tammy's crying because Jimmy's

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:90%
whatever he's done.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And mascara runs, and
everyone-- oh, he's just a man.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's just
doing what men do.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.940 align:middle line:90%
We have to forgive him.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.489 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying,
yeah, we're all people.

00:19:22.489 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:90%
We all have these things.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.859 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying, one
has to hold oneself

00:19:25.859 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
to a little higher
standard than that

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:90%
if you're going to profess.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's the key point.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:90%
We're all seekers.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I love what Pythagoras
said about learning.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras said, when I come
across those who I share with,

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:90%
I call them brother and sister.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:84%
When I come upon those who I
meet that give me information,

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:90%
I call them father or mother.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I come across as
those who I impart wisdom to,

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:90%
I call them son and daughter.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:84%
This great
philosopher was always

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:84%
open to learning and receiving
from others without saying,

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:90%
I know it all.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So I, in my belief
system, hold anyone

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.470 align:middle line:84%
up to a higher standard
who calls himself

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:90%
a guru, a master, or a teacher.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:27.665 align:middle line:84%
Because they are
imparting this to others,

00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:84%
sending a lot of
them-- I'm going

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:84%
to use the example of a
couple names used earlier--

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
they're sending other
people to hell and hellfire

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.760 align:middle line:90%
and damnation.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But then when the
table is turned,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.090 align:middle line:84%
they don't live under
the same standard.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:84%
I have more respect for
somebody who is consistent,

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:84%
whether I agree
with them or not,

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.390 align:middle line:84%
than somebody who
is out of integrity.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand that.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I have a little note
written down here.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.271 align:middle line:84%
We already kind of blew
past Socrates, here,

00:20:58.271 --> 00:20:59.770 align:middle line:84%
but there was a
note here, I thought

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:84%
it might be worth just
going back and revisiting

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.550 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to Socrates
and his revealing of some

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:84%
of the great mysterious
knowledge of the day.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And that was called, Socrates'
little demon, or daemon.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
think I'm almost coming

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.550 align:middle line:90%
across too serious, here.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to let
people know, in a real life,

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.182 align:middle line:90%
I'm a very fun-loving guy.

00:21:21.182 --> 00:21:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you are.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:22.726 align:middle line:90%
Lethyl.

00:21:22.726 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:84%
We will talk about lethyl
at some other time.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
Socrates' little daemon.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Socrates wrote a
very interesting--

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:84%
or spoke about a treatise
about a guidance mechanism

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.660 align:middle line:90%
that he possessed.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And he referred
to it is a daemon.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Of course, now,
here's another one

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.867 align:middle line:84%
of those terms that
has one meaning now

00:21:44.867 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:90%
and another meaning in the past.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:90%
In the past, it was very kind.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also
remember, it's D-A-E-M-O-N,

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:90%
is the ancient one.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And please explain
what that means.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:84%
That represented a
higher order of beings

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:84%
that were available
for individuals,

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.670 align:middle line:84%
coming out of nature, and
also through individuals.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:10%
So Socrates referred
to this daemon

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:10%
as it would always
give him advice

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:10%
when he was about to do
something wrong or incorrect.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:84%
If he was going to do something
that was of high ethics

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
or not get him into
trouble, he wouldn't hear.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was his criteria
of knowing whether he

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:90%
was on the right path or not.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The little
daemon on his shoulder.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.966 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: A little
daemon on his shoulder.

00:22:33.966 --> 00:22:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And the story is told
that he was walking

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.310 align:middle line:84%
with a group of
other philosophers,

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to walk
along a particular street

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that they had walked
along many, many times.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And his little daemon
said, don't do it.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Don't go this way.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.760 align:middle line:84%
So he told all these
other philosophers,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and they probably had been
drinking, or whatever.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:90%
And they continued on.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:90%
He didn't.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And a herd of swine ended
up coming down that street

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and basically running over
the group of philosophers,

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:90%
but not him.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And so he spoke
about it, whether it

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:84%
was in the major aspects of
his life, or even something

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
about not being run
over by a herd of swine,

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.260 align:middle line:90%
it is something that exists.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:10%
That is an aspect
that really one

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:10%
needs to look at to understand
what these ancients were doing.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:10%
Because what he did
there was an aspect

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.860 align:middle line:10%
of what was learned in those
ancient mystery schools.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:46.950 align:middle line:84%
It is opening up to a greater
aspect residing in all of us,

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:90%
every single one of us.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:10%
And it is going to be-- in
animals, it's called instinct.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And in individuals,
it's called intuition.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And from here, we have
several different characters

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:90%
that we can move on to.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to kind of
reverse the way I was thinking

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:84%
about the conversation, because
I really don't want to miss

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:90%
the part about JR Newton.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And because this-- you
were saying this thing

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:90%
available to all of us.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:84%
He exemplified a "thing"
that is a state of being

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:90%
that is available to all of us.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I haven't
set up correctly.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.190 align:middle line:84%
For people who haven't seen
me interview you before,

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
this audience, they need to know
that A, you're a philosopher.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Your PhD is in
philosophy, thus you

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:84%
can talk about these
things with clarity.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And also, you're a student of
life and healing and medicine.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.564 align:middle line:90%
And you have--

00:24:40.564 --> 00:24:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And fun.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And fun, lethyl.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have the World
Research Foundation.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:51.112 align:middle line:84%
Which is this amazing
library, private library,

00:24:51.112 --> 00:24:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that some of the people that
have benefited from it-- which

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:84%
is about half a million people--
have funded through donations

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and such, that has the most
amazing array of knowledge.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's on the electrical
system of the body and healing

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.180 align:middle line:84%
with electricity from
the 1500s forward,

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:84%
color therapy throughout the
ages, every form of healing,

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.190 align:middle line:84%
right up to the newest
technologies today.

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:17.080 align:middle line:84%
You have it in your library and
have helped a lot of people.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.745 align:middle line:84%
And there's more to that story,
which we'll get in later.

00:25:19.745 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you for that.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just I want
people to know who you are.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.778 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Because they may
have come across like,

00:25:24.778 --> 00:25:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Attila the Hun with my
viewpoint, and that's

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:90%
not what I'm trying to do.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.408 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no, not at all.

00:25:30.408 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's now talk
about JR Newton

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and that other state of being
that's available to all of us

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:90%
and what he did with it.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: JR Newton was a healer
that lived in the 1800s.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
In lectures I've done
around the world,

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I have asked how many people
have heard of JR Newton,

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and nobody has ever
raised their hand.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.990 align:middle line:84%
This is an individual
who was in the United

00:25:53.990 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
States who cured or rectified
the diseases of 250,000 people.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Those healings where attested to
by mayors, governors, sheriffs,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.160 align:middle line:90%
lawyers, newspaper editors.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.580 align:middle line:84%
People were brought to him
who were completely paralyzed,

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:84%
with withered legs
for 15 to 20 years.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.770 align:middle line:90%
All sorts of ailments.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And in 10 to 15
minutes, they walked out

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
of his presence
perfectly normal,

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:84%
as if they had
never had a problem.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And his philosophy, his mode
of therapy, was a real secret.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.451 align:middle line:90%
It was called love.

00:26:42.451 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:90%
His philosophy was love.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.366 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most people
would say at this point,

00:26:45.366 --> 00:26:47.900 align:middle line:84%
was it their faith in
his love, or was it

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:84%
his ability to project that very
high, clear, clean frequency

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:53.487 align:middle line:90%
into their being?

00:26:53.487 --> 00:26:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It was both.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Because faith is established
when somebody has this feeling

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that something is
going to happen.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Not that they think
it's going to happen,

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.670 align:middle line:90%
it is going to happen.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And JR Newton said, to
the matter of healing,

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.730 align:middle line:84%
it is a demonstration
of the power of love.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.800 align:middle line:90%
I tell someone I love them.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:90%
I show them I love them.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.670 align:middle line:90%
And the disease must depart.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are people who'd
go on to say, I really love.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm the epitome of love.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.950 align:middle line:90%
But you don't feel it.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:90%
JR Newton exuded love.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It was said that nobody
could argue in this presence.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It was stated that his
eyes and his vision,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.719 align:middle line:84%
when he gazed at you,
I should say his gaze--

00:27:46.719 --> 00:27:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful face.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Very pure.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Was so overwhelming
that people just

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:84%
felt and knew that something
beautiful was going to happen.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And in this beauty that
this man exuded with love,

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.150 align:middle line:90%
these healings took place.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, he stated on
his failures-- he

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:11.360 align:middle line:84%
had 250,000 successes--
his failures came

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.040 align:middle line:84%
because people didn't
believe that he could do it.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:84%
They were so indoctrinated and
believed that it wasn't going

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:90%
to happen, it didn't.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But he lived the life
for his entire life.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
We're back to-- because I could
say that is a form of alchemy.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:84%
He had the Philosopher's
Stone, because what

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find out is
the Philosopher's Stone just

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:90%
may be love.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:84%
That this ultimate that all
these individuals sought,

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.170 align:middle line:84%
all these alchemists
wrote about,

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:84%
was not a stone
outside or inside.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.200 align:middle line:90%
It was a vibration of love.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And this love solidified
in them that they--

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.600 align:middle line:90%
let's use an analogy.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Love is like the genie
in Aladdin's lamp.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:84%
It is through love that the rod
of the wonder workers exists.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So there are some depictions,
friezes, of Jesus.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Somebody on another
one of your shows

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:90%
mentioned Jesus holding a rod.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.880 align:middle line:84%
It just may be that that rod was
love, because how else can you

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:32.730 align:middle line:84%
possibly depict somebody
emanating and touching another,

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.220 align:middle line:84%
except by showing a
magical rod of love?

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And JR Newton
exhibited it, which

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.770 align:middle line:84%
lets me get back to kind
of what our point is.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that a
lot of these people

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.560 align:middle line:84%
who teach these mystery
classes, their students

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:84%
don't come out of
it any greater.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that most of the
religious institutions,

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
when their revelator
said, there will

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:84%
come those who do
greater things than I,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.534 align:middle line:84%
and they read this book
over and over and over--

00:30:04.534 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
referring to the Bible.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.500 align:middle line:90%
The New Testament, yeah?

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes, the Bible.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Why are people not demonstrating
and living these precepts?

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, somebody may pop
up and say, no, no.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.560 align:middle line:90%
I do live these precepts.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:10%
I profess in the
name of so and so.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:10%
In Jesus I do this.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.080 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Jesus laid out a complete
lifestyle of love and beauty.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was in
integrity all the time.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, people don't need me
to say he was in integrity,

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.360 align:middle line:90%
but let's look at it.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.650 align:middle line:84%
He worked with people who
were quote, "sinners."

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.770 align:middle line:84%
He worked with the good,
he worked with the bad.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:52.040 align:middle line:84%
He didn't pick and choose
who he was working with.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.407 align:middle line:84%
All individuals
who were in need.

00:30:54.407 --> 00:30:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, if
you have a wedding,

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and you run out of wine,
you need to have good wine,

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:84%
this individual always
was right there.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.430 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to make
it a religious as much as,

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:10.060 align:middle line:84%
why did one of the most
brilliant individuals, who

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:84%
argued with rabbis at
13, never write anything?

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:20.890 align:middle line:84%
He had to be smart enough, or
he could not have been debating.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:84%
According to records, he
only wrote down one time.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:84%
He drew something in the
sand when they were stoning

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:30.330 align:middle line:90%
the harlot and then erased it.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:35.480 align:middle line:84%
My understanding,
my belief is, he

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.400 align:middle line:84%
wrote because the written word
will always be misinterpreted,

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.930 align:middle line:90%
but examples not.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And now we're back
to the alchemists.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.470 align:middle line:90%
It was by example.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.330 align:middle line:84%
It was by physically
experiencing

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:53.960 align:middle line:84%
what was taking place
in those ancient mystery

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:59.310 align:middle line:84%
schools, a thorough
understanding of bypassing

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
the conscious mind and reaching
higher states where the greater

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.666 align:middle line:90%
illumination was taking place.

00:32:07.666 --> 00:32:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this,
going back to JR Newton

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:84%
within this, that force
we call love, which

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:19.030 align:middle line:84%
William Tiller, the physicist,
calls "the universal solvent"

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.879 align:middle line:90%
is love.

00:32:19.879 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That is it.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm just
kind of reflecting

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.340 align:middle line:84%
on the feeling of what
you were talking about.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So if JR Newton, if these other
alchemists and philosophers

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.710 align:middle line:84%
of the day that were credited
with being able to heal masses,

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.640 align:middle line:84%
individuals to masses,
just feeling that, sitting

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.460 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of someone
that has that purity

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and clarity in their ability to
share that force that we call

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:51.520 align:middle line:84%
love, it completely melts
and disarms a being,

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.670 align:middle line:84%
so that it would bypass
the conscious mind.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:84%
If we even think of
the moments when,

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.910 align:middle line:84%
even in maybe a
different manner,

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.730 align:middle line:84%
we have been newly in love,
and you're looking at someone,

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and you feel that light, that
warmth, pouring into you.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Everything is chemically
altered in your being.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Coming from that pure place
with that intention where you've

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:17.330 align:middle line:84%
asked for help, you can see how
that would be the solvent that

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:17.956 align:middle line:90%
would heal all.

00:33:17.956 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: You've
said it perfectly.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.732 align:middle line:84%
And that should be the end
of our show now, because--

00:33:21.732 --> 00:33:24.449 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, a couple more
things to talk about, but yes.

00:33:24.449 --> 00:33:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --because when we
look at these different

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.720 align:middle line:84%
individuals-- I want to
highlight Paracelsus,

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:84%
who was probably regarded
as one of the greatest

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.770 align:middle line:90%
alchemists of all time.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who actually could do
the outer alchemy as well as

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.790 align:middle line:90%
the inner.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.470 align:middle line:84%
What people fail to realize,
because they don't take time

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to read everything
that he talked about,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:84%
he was very adamant
about the power of love.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But in a lot of these
classes and courses,

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.800 align:middle line:84%
when people bring up Paracelsus,
they're talking about, OK.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.180 align:middle line:84%
He did this, and he had
talismans, and he did this,

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.460 align:middle line:90%
and he did that.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Because within all of
the alchemical writings,

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:13.480 align:middle line:84%
as secretive as they are,
Regina, the philosopher would

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.449 align:middle line:84%
always put in one sentence,
somewhere there would say,

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:21.020 align:middle line:84%
if you are trying to
do this on the outside,

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.679 align:middle line:84%
you are going to be very
sadly disappointed, because it

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:26.800 align:middle line:90%
isn't going to happen.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And other individuals always
would put a key in there

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:38.159 align:middle line:84%
that would really help a seeker
truly understand that they are

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:43.600 align:middle line:84%
writing an outer text to
grab the consciousness

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.280 align:middle line:84%
of the individual, with the idea
that once your consciousness is

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:55.600 align:middle line:84%
occupied with all this minutia,
a higher aspect comes through.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And this greater wisdom
then emanates, permeates,

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.190 align:middle line:90%
takes over the individual.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And this love element
that you're speaking of

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.859 align:middle line:84%
can neutralize everything
and anything instantly.

00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the
highest frequency.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: The highest frequency.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
does trump everything,

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.960 align:middle line:84%
just as you were telling
about the three black snakes

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.120 align:middle line:90%
and the one white snake.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The positive in
love always will supersede.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:84%
That was the end of
that little story

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.840 align:middle line:84%
that people kind of
blow through with Moses.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Like, wait a minute.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.860 align:middle line:90%
You've just come from God.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:84%
You're just come from
this interaction.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:38.280 align:middle line:84%
You have all the power, and
you go and do something,

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and the other people
were able to do it also.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So could it be that you
are not necessarily given,

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:54.320 align:middle line:84%
from God or the higher source,
the secret of doing something.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.650 align:middle line:90%
It is a wisdom of how to use it.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:01.859 align:middle line:84%
And that is the difference
between knowledge and wisdom.

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Now have we anything more
at this moment to say about,

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call it
the alchemy of love.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:84%
The thing that transcends,
transforms, and alters.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I would say that we
can never talk enough about it.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe that in order for
people to really get it,

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:28.500 align:middle line:84%
we need to continue on
with explaining examples

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.720 align:middle line:90%
of how pertinent it is.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Because people out there,
especially the ones

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:84%
who have bought into
courses and gurus

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and teachers, when we say
love, it sounds too easy.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It sounds trite.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It sounds trite,
because we've made love trite.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And you also have been through
Germany, so you'll understand.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.560 align:middle line:84%
In the United States,
love is called love.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.186 align:middle line:84%
But in Germany, there may
be 13 or 14 definitions.

00:36:59.186 --> 00:37:00.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same in Greek.

00:37:00.185 --> 00:37:00.685 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Because I could
say, I love my car.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Honey, I love you.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm using the same word,
which is that love I--

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.430 align:middle line:90%
it's the word love.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's more defined.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:15.731 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But qualitatively,
it's very different.

00:37:15.731 --> 00:37:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And we as a species, most
of us know how to love.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:84%
We know it when
we see our child.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:84%
The first moment we see a
child after their birth,

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:84%
there is this
overwhelming thing that

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:90%
happens to most individuals.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Which is, again, that
pure love that's not

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.370 align:middle line:84%
assigned to any specific
traits or other values.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we let
ourselves off the hook

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.350 align:middle line:90%
in terms of our lower behavior.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And we've fallen into
very sloppy habits

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:84%
around holding on to the
need to indict on some level.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:54.950 align:middle line:84%
To create other
and us, when if we

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:56.870 align:middle line:84%
could just discipline
ourselves for a moment--

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Ah.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Now you just said
the magic word.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Discipline.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.490 align:middle line:90%
That means it takes work.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:90%
It takes an effort.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:09.720 align:middle line:84%
It takes a conscious effort
until it becomes unconscious

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.930 align:middle line:90%
that you just are it.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:16.090 align:middle line:84%
So you just really
described why there

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.340 align:middle line:84%
was a need for those
schools in the ancient time.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it isn't something
that you just snap your finger,

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and you find that magic elixir,
and you find that magic stone,

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:29.270 align:middle line:90%
and you find the magic rod.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.310 align:middle line:90%
It is a discipline.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.820 align:middle line:90%
It is work.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Plato and Socrates, I put
them, obviously, together,

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:84%
because Plato described his
conversations with Socrates.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:47.230 align:middle line:10%
"The Symposium" that they
have written, "The Banquet,"

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.980 align:middle line:10%
is one of the more
profound dialogues.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Because in it, it
talks about love.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.040 align:middle line:84%
It talks about
different types of love.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It is actually discussing what
our conversation has been.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And several philosophers,
the Neo-Platonists said,

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:12.660 align:middle line:84%
their reading of "The
Banquet" and "The Symposium,"

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:84%
which it was called
either one, gave them

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
the key to reach the
higher enlightenment

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:90%
that they experienced.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.560 align:middle line:90%
They weren't mixing chemicals.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:84%
They weren't doing
outer experiments.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:84%
But they had this oneness
with the Supreme Source.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Because within that text was
what was taking place, partly,

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.400 align:middle line:90%
in those mystery schools.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So the wisdom has
always been around

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:90%
if people know where to look.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's the ego and
it's the mystery.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:53.230 align:middle line:10%
If I go and attend this course
that this person's doing,

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:10%
I am going to have something
over my friend here,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.310 align:middle line:10%
because I am being
taught the secret wisdom.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I am getting the
arcana, the unknown.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is the roadblock
to that essential thing

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:09.570 align:middle line:90%
we call love, though.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I should be interviewing
you, because you have it down.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.410 align:middle line:90%
It is the block.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:16.230 align:middle line:90%
It is the block.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:10%
It is a block that
we are so much

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:27.250 align:middle line:10%
looking to get, to find, to
own, that we have forgotten

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:30.020 align:middle line:10%
what the old teachings were.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.010 align:middle line:84%
The more you give,
the more you receive.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:35.160 align:middle line:90%
It is an endless supply.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And I personally, in
my understanding-- now,

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I keep using that
phrase, because I am not

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:46.120 align:middle line:84%
going to dogmatically say, I
know, and this is the way--

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.960 align:middle line:84%
but my understanding
is that each of us

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:55.910 align:middle line:84%
has a direct link with
the higher sources,

00:40:55.910 --> 00:41:00.040 align:middle line:84%
with the greater
wisdom within us.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:05.920 align:middle line:10%
And if there truly is a
loving mother/father up there,

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.730 align:middle line:10%
it should be so
easy for us to find

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:16.710 align:middle line:10%
and not some mysterious, buried,
only certain people possess,

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:18.270 align:middle line:10%
only they know.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.625 align:middle line:84%
Because no parent down
here would do that

00:41:21.625 --> 00:41:23.550 align:middle line:90%
to their young kids.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:27.150 align:middle line:84%
To have them go and try
to dig and find an answer,

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:31.640 align:middle line:84%
losing time, and then have
to spend an eternity in hell.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So if a regular
parent is like that,

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I expect my mother/father up
there to be just as loving.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible
that the alchemical key

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.220 align:middle line:90%
is beauty and love?

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I was
just going to ask you next.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Because a key element
here is beauty.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And we don't-- and we're
not talking about the cover

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:90%
of "Elle" magazine beauty.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:00.190 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about beauty
in the most sublime sense.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:03.630 align:middle line:84%
As you say, it is
the partner of love.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So let's speak about
beauty by this definition.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And where beauty was
put on a pedestal

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:84%
among the great philosophers and
spiritual leaders, so to speak,

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:90%
of the day.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: One of the important
tenets from the Greeks

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:21.050 align:middle line:90%
was the following.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:25.300 align:middle line:84%
The one, the good,
and the beautiful.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.630 align:middle line:90%
And what did that mean?

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.100 align:middle line:10%
The one is very obvious.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It's one, one
all-encompassing all.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:37.210 align:middle line:84%
The word good, for the
ancients, meant everything works

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.740 align:middle line:90%
in integrity.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you do something in
nature in the world one time,

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.870 align:middle line:84%
you are going to
get an effect that

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:48.850 align:middle line:90%
is consistent all the time.

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:51.980 align:middle line:84%
If you break a
law of nature, you

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:84%
are going to reap
a certain penalty.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.240 align:middle line:84%
You are going to reap
a certain lesson.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And that would happen
over and over and over.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So the ancients
said, that's good.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.890 align:middle line:10%
Even if the result was
bad, Regina, it's good.

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.360 align:middle line:10%
Because that means
if I go this way,

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.050 align:middle line:10%
this is going to be the result.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You will
learn the truth.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: You are going to learn
that lesson and the truth.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.990 align:middle line:90%
And the third tenet was beauty.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, beauty, of course, people
can sit here and ruminize

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:84%
over and over, no, beauty means
this, and beauty means that.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Beauty is referring to an
integrity of the parts.

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.530 align:middle line:90%
It is that everything fits in.

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:40.240 align:middle line:84%
That it is
aesthetically beautiful.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.160 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks would not allow
any irregular shapes.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.340 align:middle line:84%
They didn't allow, at
a certain time, music

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.880 align:middle line:90%
with discordant notes.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Because that interruption
of the normal flow,

00:43:55.180 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:84%
the integrity of something,
a building, an environment,

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:06.430 align:middle line:84%
was so disrupting, it
stopped you from the flow.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, this of course we
could make a whole show on.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.800 align:middle line:84%
But the ancients believed
that there were founts

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.590 align:middle line:90%
of wisdom, beauty, truth.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Plato, when he spoke about
the ideal, that sphere,

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:26.410 align:middle line:84%
there was an ideal coming
from the higher cosmos,

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:29.720 align:middle line:84%
by gradations, down
to our Earth plane.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.320 align:middle line:10%
And if we mirrored
things down here,

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.700 align:middle line:10%
we were connected to those
tremendous founts of wisdom.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So they kept beauty here
because it aligned you

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.030 align:middle line:84%
with the beauty coming
from the higher spheres,

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.405 align:middle line:90%
from that state of perfection.

00:44:48.405 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also that
state of equilibrium.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you look to the sacred
geometry throughout the ages,

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.740 align:middle line:84%
there's always an
equilibrium in this geometry.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're bringing up something
that triggered a memory

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.760 align:middle line:84%
of something else, which was--
and I won't go into any great

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.449 align:middle line:90%
detail, but it is in the--

00:45:04.449 --> 00:45:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Regina, it's your show.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:06.531 align:middle line:90%
You go into detail.

00:45:06.531 --> 00:45:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no.

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:10.360 align:middle line:84%
It's in the congressional
record in January of 1964,

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and it had to do with the--
this is a long, drawn-out thing

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:20.410 align:middle line:84%
about a congressional committee
that was formed to hear out

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:24.179 align:middle line:84%
the findings of a woman
who had essentially had-- I

00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:84%
don't think it was her, I
think she had others doing it

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:30.450 align:middle line:84%
on her behalf-- infiltrated
the "communist" agenda here

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:84%
on the planet,
especially in America.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And but one-- that's
here nor there.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:36.200 align:middle line:90%
That's political.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.430 align:middle line:90%
But not really.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
came out of it that was,

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to me, the most shocking
of the 47 points

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:44.050 align:middle line:84%
that were made in
that hearing, was

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.490 align:middle line:84%
that there would be
a concerted effort

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:51.280 align:middle line:84%
to create disharmony
and asymmetry in art

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:57.200 align:middle line:84%
to start creating a
disequilibrium amongst society

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.930 align:middle line:84%
at large to make us
more manageable and more

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:01.260 align:middle line:90%
controllable.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's so interesting.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And it may show my closed
mindedness on "Open Minds,"

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:12.180 align:middle line:84%
but whatever that is, I always
had an immediate revulsion

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.090 align:middle line:84%
at what I felt was really
asymmetrical-- like throwing

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:17.950 align:middle line:90%
poo on a canvas.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm supposed to evaluate
that and contemplate that.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I've not been able to do it,
because there is no beauty.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:30.160 align:middle line:84%
But that is how our world
has now been constructed.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And I feel
very moved, and I

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:37.990 align:middle line:84%
feel it's important to share
a story from Paracelsus'

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:40.010 align:middle line:90%
time in the 1500s.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:45.210 align:middle line:84%
An individual had locked
themselves in a room,

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.760 align:middle line:84%
closing all the windows,
closing all the doors,

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:53.140 align:middle line:84%
and did not come out for
quite an amount of time.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And when they finally went
in, the individual was dead.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was
edicts during his era

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.200 align:middle line:84%
that you have to close your
windows, at least at night,

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:04.700 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The evil night
humors will get you.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The devil will come
in or the plague will come in.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And they also said you take a
bath once a year, because you

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.590 align:middle line:90%
don't want to hurt yourself.

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.990 align:middle line:84%
When they went in there and
found this individual dead,

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Paracelsus, unlike anyone
else who was there,

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.450 align:middle line:84%
realized that there was
a great truth there.

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:27.180 align:middle line:90%
What was the truth?

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.200 align:middle line:84%
He recognized that
nothing from the outside

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.680 align:middle line:84%
had killed this
individual, but something

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:37.930 align:middle line:84%
within their own atmosphere
had poisoned them.

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And so here was one
of his philosophies.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is
closed up and does not

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:54.490 align:middle line:84%
have a fresh stream of energy or
knowledge will wither and die,

00:47:54.490 --> 00:48:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and that includes religions,
political parties,

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:04.360 align:middle line:90%
individuals who are dogmatic.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:11.070 align:middle line:84%
That is an aspect of
nature, any closed system.

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the old
hermetic philosophy comes in.

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:16.090 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:17.930 align:middle line:90%
And as below, so above.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:23.010 align:middle line:84%
There are fundamental truths
that reign through the cosmos.

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:26.590 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the
hermetic philosophies that

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.570 align:middle line:90%
have existed throughout time.

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.300 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to bring
him up because that

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.800 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what you're sharing.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, do
you suppose as above,

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.410 align:middle line:84%
there may be poo on a canvas
dripping down somewhere?

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it
possible that I'm just

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.070 align:middle line:84%
rejecting, maybe something
that doesn't personally

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.050 align:middle line:90%
appeal to me?

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Or could there be something
more fundamental to it,

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.070 align:middle line:84%
as in being out of sync
with the natural geometry

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:49.430 align:middle line:90%
of the universe?

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:50.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:51.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the answer to it.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It's what works for you.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Because the bottom line is,
as all these ancient teachers

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:01.660 align:middle line:84%
would teach, stop
empowering people outside.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not saying it to you.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:05.970 align:middle line:84%
People, remember, I'm
a very loving man.

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:09.390 align:middle line:90%
Don't empower people outside.

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:10.965 align:middle line:90%
You trust yourself.

00:49:10.965 --> 00:49:13.720 align:middle line:90%


00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Our friend Paracelsus was at
a party that his parents had.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.820 align:middle line:90%
He was a young man.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And this sick dog
walked out of the party

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.395 align:middle line:84%
and started to go
in the countryside.

00:49:26.395 --> 00:49:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And Paracelsus was very
young, and he said, well

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather follow the dog.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And the dog who had been ill
walked into the countryside,

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.260 align:middle line:84%
sniffing various
grasses and herbs.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Went on, and eventually started
eating an herb or a plant.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.340 align:middle line:90%
The dog lay down.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:50.610 align:middle line:84%
45 minutes later, it got up and
seemingly was perfectly normal.

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And Paracelsus
wondered, why was it

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:58.010 align:middle line:84%
that a dog could find out
what would work for him,

00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:59.700 align:middle line:90%
and as human beings--

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are looking to
someone above, below, whatever.

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:03.890 align:middle line:84%
To the side, to
see our own truth.

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:05.098 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's exactly right.

00:50:05.098 --> 00:50:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and just
to wrap this part up,

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.300 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to have
a second conversation, which

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:14.410 align:middle line:84%
is really going to be, I think,
mind expanding for people.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:18.530 align:middle line:84%
But toward that end of beauty,
you have in your own home

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:23.280 align:middle line:84%
a room of beauty that also has
this amazing archive that we

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.680 align:middle line:90%
talked about earlier.

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And you chose that
specifically based

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:29.840 align:middle line:84%
on, I believe you said it
was a 15th or 16th century

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.860 align:middle line:84%
concept, that to promote
beauty, whether it was visually,

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.890 align:middle line:84%
auditory, or whatnot, was
central to one's life.

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:40.570 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: They were called
Studiolo, the word "studio"

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:43.680 align:middle line:10%
with a "lo," and
Isabella d'Este,

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:49.880 align:middle line:10%
who has been often called the
mother of the Renaissance,

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:55.030 align:middle line:10%
she built rooms where the
greatest art of the day

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:56.590 align:middle line:10%
was on the walls.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:59.610 align:middle line:90%
The greatest books were there.

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:02.660 align:middle line:10%
Music played from
the greatest artists.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:09.570 align:middle line:10%
Because that Renaissance was
re-erecting those ancient times

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.660 align:middle line:10%
where beauty was the
key note that brought

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.550 align:middle line:10%
the mind into alignment.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And our room that
we have in the house

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:21.990 align:middle line:90%
plays music 24 hours a day.

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you gaze anywhere,
you can't help but see beauty.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, before we wrap
up this conversation,

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:34.280 align:middle line:84%
one thing we didn't talk about
that I wanted to get to was

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.590 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about
mother and father above.

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:40.510 align:middle line:84%
One mother being
Sophia, that of wisdom.

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Because you already teased
us with the notion of wisdom

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.070 align:middle line:90%
verses knowledge.

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:46.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to carry that over
into our second conversation

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and look at where
a lack of wisdom

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.800 align:middle line:84%
has destroyed beautiful
civilizations repeatedly,

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and taken them from their
height to utter destruction.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.570 align:middle line:90%
So that comes next.

00:51:58.570 --> 00:51:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And how we can avoid that.

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.611 align:middle line:84%
Because we might be
sitting on a precipice.

00:52:01.611 --> 00:52:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: OK.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Steven.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.240 align:middle line:10%
So join us next time in
the second conversation,

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.550 align:middle line:10%
in which we'll look
at the fall of Rome

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:11.140 align:middle line:10%
