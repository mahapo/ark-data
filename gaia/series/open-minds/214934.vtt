00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: All of
you have heard of the word

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.770 align:middle line:90%
"alchemy."

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle line:10%
The person who made this concept
knowable to the public was

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.940 align:middle line:10%
the 15th century Swiss physician
and iconoclast Paracelsus.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:10%
He married new thought
and ideas in medicine

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:10%
with a classic understanding
of transforming base metals

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:10%
into precious metals.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.290 align:middle line:10%
But much has changed
since then, and the term

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.380 align:middle line:10%
is being used by many now, each
with their own understanding

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle line:10%
of what it offers.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
One such person
is Sarah Elkhaldy,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:84%
who equates it with the
transformation of consciousness.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Sarah.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So you're one of
the new generation

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:84%
of powerful woman, young
woman, who has actually

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of very rich
and deep experiences

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
to bring about your own
awareness, consciousness,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:90%
expansion.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're out there, I've
seen you on the internet,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.360 align:middle line:84%
speaking on an
array of subjects.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into some rather deep stuff

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:84%
today, including the
subject of alchemy.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, your
title is the alchemist.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So what do you mean
and what are you

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.628 align:middle line:84%
embracing when you use the
word alchemy or that title?

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:10%
>> SARAH ELKHALDY: When
I use the term "alchemy,"

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm specifically talking
about the spiritual amnesia,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:10%
or sometimes it's even called
in esoteric circles the perfect

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:10%
possession that the human
collective is under.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:10%
So when we're looking at
the human consciousness's

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.970 align:middle line:10%
natural evolution, we would look
at it as going through trials.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I call them the alchemical
backdrop to all of our lives.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's a spiritual
initiation at hand,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and that spiritual initiation
is the alchemical process.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's alchemy.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
what is being alchemised?

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.250 align:middle line:90%
What is that journey or process?

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Would actually be one that's
awakening out of the deep spell

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that the human
consciousness is placed

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
under that I call spiritual
amnesia to awaken into unity

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:84%
consciousness or what some
are calling God consciousness?

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
That awakening is specifically
what alchemy means in the level

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that I'm addressing it,
knowing that alchemy

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.260 align:middle line:90%
means more than one thing.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
why I brought it up.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because it's a
word that carries a lot of--

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.820 align:middle line:84%
well, it has a lot of different
meanings and perceptions

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.060 align:middle line:90%
So good.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Now we know where you're
coming from with this.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Also, the notion of
alchemy in general

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
has always meant colluding
with and marrying with nature.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Does this-- how does
nature play a part

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
in this for your notion
of awakening and expanding

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and moving into
higher realms of consciousness

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%
from base metal consciousness?

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah so there's
always this dynamism between art

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and between what we would call
nature or what another person

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.030 align:middle line:90%
could just call their life.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what really
nature's talking about.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:84%
It's talking about the materials
around them, their environment,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:90%
the people, places, and things.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:10%
So that is interfacing.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Our reality is interfacing.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So nature is showing us some
sort of thing happening, which

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:90%
is consciousness.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.233 align:middle line:84%
So it's showing us something
that's happening internally

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:90%
as without.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:90%
As within, so without.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, our art is
how we interface with nature.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So our art is how our
consciousness, our free will

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.580 align:middle line:90%
interfaces.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
It reacts, response to
nature, which is just reality.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, the alchemists
used this to mean

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:10%
that nature was the very
raw materials you were given

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:10%
and the process that they would
naturally be on if nothing

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:10%
was interfered with.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So the alchemists
came from the mindset

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
that nature would take too
long and would not even

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.535 align:middle line:84%
evolve specifically in the
way that it intended to,

00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:01.225 align:middle line:84%
to get to that
enlightened state of gold.

00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It would not reach
gold, and if it did,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.580 align:middle line:84%
it would go over a
far amount of time.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So they use art, which is
the laboratory process,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:84%
or art, which is their
medicinal process.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And Paracelsus's process,
it was so holistic.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:84%
He really revolutionized
alchemy because he

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
brought in so many
different facets

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and then reinvented our
understanding of alchemy.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:90%
All of that is art.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:10%
It was something that came in
and then created the evolution,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:10%
because what we see is
that whether it's called

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:10%
predeterminism or free
will or nature and art,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:10%
there's this thing
that needs to be grown.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:10%
This muscle called free will
that needs to be exercised.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And so that muscle of
exercising freewill

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
will eventually go through
the alchemical process.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And then what you'll see
is that art and nature

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:90%
are in a relationship together.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And that relationship is
what creates the gold.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the nature.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not just predeterminism.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's not as though
nature itself has frequencies

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:90%
that teach us.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:10%
>> ELKHALDY: Now,
nature is helping us.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Nature is, like I said,
the reality around us.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:10%
But if we're going to use
the alchemical laboratory

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:10%
terminology of how nature
and art was being used

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:10%
in that context,
how the Alchemist

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:10%
was using nature
and art was saying

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:10%
that the art of the great
work was really how to--

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:10%
quick in, how to
improve upon nature.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.650 align:middle line:10%
So he was saying that
once again, the gold could

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.330 align:middle line:10%
take one lifetime or it
could take however long

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:10%
to come into gold.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:90%
So nature isn't neutral.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Nature is something that's
there for us to interact with.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And then if we choose
to use our free

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:84%
will to interact
with that in a way

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
that it can be built
up into enlightenment.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But that nature is there to
provide us the materials.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not there to tell
us we must evolve.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:10%
That's where our art
comes in, and that's

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:10%
what alchemy was
using that context in.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:84%
It was saying the great
work or the process,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:84%
whether it's laboratory
or spiritual,

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.950 align:middle line:84%
was meant to have
our art included.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And that if our art, meaning us
going through that, if it's not

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:84%
consciously participated
in that process,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.443 align:middle line:84%
nature is not going
to do it for you.

00:06:25.443 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I agree with that.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's move on to one of the
really sticky and interesting

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
subjects, which has to do with
the bifurcation of timelines

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and having to do with
levels of consciousness

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and the way you
see that right now.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So the bifurcation is
pretty, to me, obvious.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe even
a decade ago it

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.910 align:middle line:84%
could have still been something
that was like a fringe topic

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, but I
think it's very obvious

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that the realms that
people are inhabiting

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.060 align:middle line:84%
are becoming having
less and less in common.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, I agree.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: And having so much
less in common that it looks

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:84%
almost like it would be a
complete shift in what a person

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:84%
truly needs for
their soul to learn.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.190 align:middle line:90%
And so I call that a curriculum.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And so how I see this and
how I use it in a paradigm

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
that it could just make
sense and look more neutral

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle line:84%
rather than having any type
of harsh dogmatic projections

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
placed on top of it is that
it's just a curriculum shift.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
group consciousness

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and they have mastered
a specific curriculum,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
that freewill has
fruits, it has rewards.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:10%
And you're not just bound to
the parameters of another group

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:10%
consciousness's fate.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:84%
You have, at that point,
enough of a vibrational--

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
you have enough of a
vibrational buildup.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And that vibrational buildup is
what creates not just a paradigm

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:84%
shift, but a complete
curriculum shift

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
to where a new timeline all
together with even what looks

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:84%
like a new future or
a new past, because

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
of just how much the dominant
vibration has been shifted.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So another way of saying
a curriculum shift

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:84%
is when the dominant
vibration can no longer

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
hold the same space as
another dominant vibration.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:84%
There's just too much
of an incoherency there.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.730 align:middle line:10%
That's something that I was
speaking with my group of beings

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:10%
with a few decades
ago, and they said

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:10%
there will come a time in
the not too distant future

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:10%
where the levels
of consciousness

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:10%
are so diverse that it's no
longer serving any to stay

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:10%
in the same classroom together.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Basic kindergarten lessons
they were referring to

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.372 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
any judgment around it.

00:08:52.372 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle line:84%
It's simply these are
all lessons and learning

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that happen throughout the
universe with each species

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and every individuated being
is growing at their own rate.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:90%
So they say it just takes time.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Learning takes time
and experience.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So you have that
level of consciousness

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and then you have those that are
in the graduate school of very

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:84%
subtle understandings and
interactions with one another

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and trying to really refine
how they show themselves up

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:90%
as a conscious being.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And that the two would
not be able to live side

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:10%
by side in the future,
and their preparations

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:10%
had been made for that.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And that goes into
a whole other story.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are many different
versions and one of them

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:84%
is the timeline
version, that this

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
is where timelines
bifurcate and one group

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:84%
lives in a reality of
earth, that's one way.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And the other group lives in
another level of consciousness

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:84%
among like-minded
beings across the board.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Both, or more than both.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell us your perception of
how you mechanically see this.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: So
esoterica is no chill.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty savage.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of times when
I'm sharing information

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:10%
that I resonate with,
but that is also

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.920 align:middle line:10%
a part of deep, mystical
systems, it might sound savage,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:10%
and I understand
that, but I also

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:10%
don't think that
that really applies

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:10%
when you first understand
that a person has freewill.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So because of that,
things can sound harsh,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
but not having
the knowledge, not

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.467 align:middle line:84%
having the awareness would
actually be the cruel factor.

00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be having that
knowledge and awareness

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:90%
of the reality we live in.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead on that.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: So because of
that, how I see that is that

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.033 align:middle line:84%
there's a regenerative path and
there's a degenerative path.

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: Mysticism had
many different names for this.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:84%
One of a very prominent
name was the life wave.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a life wave,
meaning that each age goes

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:84%
through their own trials, they
go through their own challenges.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And if those themes have
not been made aware,

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:84%
have not been
integrated, they will not

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.580 align:middle line:84%
be able to carry on
in the life wave,

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
which is the
regenerative stream.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that that spiritual
initiation was not made aware,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
that spiritual initiation
was, in some form or another,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:90%
it was not passed.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.360 align:middle line:10%
And so if that falls under
the degenerative stream,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.110 align:middle line:10%
that goes into what Pythagoras
and this Pythagorean mystery

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:10%
school tradition would have
taught as metempsychosis.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:90%
It is the degeneratization.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's what I would
consider catabolic.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
instead of anabolic.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah,
it's catabolic.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
still soul essence,

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:84%
but-- and there's
always redemption.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:90%
There's always--

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and this
is really the key part,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:84%
is there's always grace
and always redemption.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
but time to learn,

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
because time doesn't exist
anyway in the way we know it.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And so looking at it that way,
I think because right now we're

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:84%
reaching a point where
societally we're bifurcated,

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.303 align:middle line:84%
everybody's at each
other's throats.

00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:02.470 align:middle line:90%
No one will hear each other.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.663 align:middle line:90%
And that's by design.

00:12:03.663 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
that's any accident.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's also time.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The time has arrived
where there is

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:84%
going to be that split
in consciousness.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So since there is grace
in this whole process,

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:84%
then you could say
no one's left behind.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: I would
absolutely agree.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.380 align:middle line:84%
The universe does
not perceive there

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:84%
being such a concept
or paradigm of left

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:84%
behind because the universe has
infinite unconditional love.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:84%
All that is required is
a being to participate

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:84%
or what I was
calling earlier, art.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It's all the
alchemical backdrop,

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.400 align:middle line:84%
is the backdrop to
all of our lives.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of whether we see

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
what's happening, whether we
interact with it, whether we

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.380 align:middle line:84%
participate in
our own evolution.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's also my
definition of ascension.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I get asked all the
time, what is ascension?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it can sound new
age, it could sound--

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.840 align:middle line:84%
it could sound vague, it
could sound just like what

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
exactly how would
you digest that.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
and I always say,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:84%
ascension is the
conscious participation

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:90%
in our own evolution.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:90%
It's already happening.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.320 align:middle line:84%
If we consciously
participate in that,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:90%
then that's called ascension.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:90%
That's also--

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think
that's a good definition.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So because of that, if
we can always participate

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and if the core rules
of this reality is we

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:84%
are spiritually sovereign, then
the most infinite compassion

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
would be making a person
aware of their sovereignty.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And there is no such
thing as being left behind

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:84%
because that would
assume that we are living

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:84%
or anyone is living in a form
of innocence of not knowing.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And the universe provides
all of the catalysts.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I tell some people, I
say, it doesn't matter

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:90%
about financial resources.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to look at
whatever someone else has

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:90%
and apply that to ourselves.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:84%
The universe will give
you the book you need.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:90%
It will give it to you for free.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Now, it'll give you a PDF.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
You have whatever you
need for your next step.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:90%
You are never left behind.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have three
completely different areas

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:90%
that start dovetailing.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you were young
and you were first

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:84%
being exposed to a lot of
information and influences,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:84%
you had contact with
extraterrestrial species.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
You say both positive
and negative.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
those experiences were

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and what you were
taking away from both,

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.987 align:middle line:90%
and how they influenced you.

00:14:31.987 --> 00:14:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: They influenced
everything from that moment

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.958 align:middle line:84%
I was even wanting to be
an actor at that time.

00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you're
certainly gorgeous enough to do

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.718 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Thank you.

00:14:42.718 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:90%
But they influenced everything.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Like I, at that point,
sought out a shaman.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, that
led to me learning from her

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and then being my own
version of shaman as well.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So it influenced my
whole life trajectory.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And what I had found
out was that it's

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
quite common for
positive beings who

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:90%
connect with somebody to then--

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:90%
the signal like almost goes out.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And so with that, comes
a lot of negative,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could
call it, attention

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:84%
that's aware of the contact or
the connections and the things.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how did
it show up in your life?

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was it a sleep thing
or, how did it show up?

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: It was
sleep, definitely,

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:84%
but it was more so
just a nighttime thing.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I feared nighttime
at that point,

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:84%
as soon as it
started getting dark,

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that I was
going to be interacted with--

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
the good influences and what

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:84%
they came for, what
they were like,

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.968 align:middle line:84%
and what they showed you
before it attracted negative.

00:15:41.968 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah, I was
learning about the true nature

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:90%
What I was being shown was how--

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:90%
and I created a video on this.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:90%
It's how to jump timelines.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:84%
I was being shown how reality
is really just a radio station.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And so because of that,
I was on a channel.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So what I was being taught
was the nature of reality

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and how it's not somewhere out
there, there's not an out there.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.818 align:middle line:84%
There's only shifting
the radio station.

00:16:08.818 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All frequency.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So I was learning about how
dimensions and densities work,

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
specifically at the
time that I was then

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.275 align:middle line:90%
also being contacted by things.

00:16:18.275 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So let's--

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you were being shown
about the vibrational nature

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.420 align:middle line:84%
of reality and that
it's not judgmental,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:90%
there's no judgment in it.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
There are just
frequencies and we

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
get to choose the band we're
going to be on, really,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:90%
through our free will.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So these things, you
were starting to learn--

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:84%
how old were you when this
all started happening?

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: All of this started
happening when I was around 18,

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:90%
19.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And then it started attracting
the other attention.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So what was the other
attention like and

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:49.080 align:middle line:84%
what was it trying to show you
or manage or control in you?

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.206 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: It was trying
to get me to self-destruct.

00:16:54.206 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.845 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well--

00:16:56.845 --> 00:17:00.602 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] it saves
them the trouble

00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:90%
if you'll do it for yourself.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah, it was--

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:90%
it was being very intimidating.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:84%
That's when I started to
learn about psychic screens.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So I learned not by
just someone telling me.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:84%
I actually had to figure out
what psychic screens were

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:84%
because I was being placed
under psychic screens

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:90%
and then screen after screen.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:90%
So that was fun.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
That'll make you
not trust when you

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:90%
can put in screen after screen.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So it actually
ended up helping me

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:84%
a lot because, one, I don't
have fear of any of those things

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:84%
to like a very highly
abnormal degree.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Like I don't have fear
of many things at all

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:90%
anymore because of that.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Also, I can traverse the
psychic realms almost impeccably

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:84%
because of the
things that I didn't

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:84%
want to learn at the
time, but my soul craved.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So it put me on a path
towards figuring out

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
how to heal these
interactions, what is going on

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:90%
with these interactions.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really actually
was a very defining point

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
in my life, is connecting with
my shaman and learning from her.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So it sounds like a
large part of this was teaching

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.620 align:middle line:10%
you discretion on the psychic
realms at an early age.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:90%
This is a big problem right now.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:90%
People open up.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle line:84%
They're connecting
with something.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:90%
They have no idea what it is.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a fair, you
know, we have a fair amount

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:84%
of influence and interference,
every one of us on this planet,

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.960 align:middle line:84%
with beings who would like to
either take a little from us

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:84%
or those lovely ones who
would like to give a little.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:10%
So let's just stay
in this area moment

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:10%
because I want to get into
the kind of AI agenda also.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
We could stay on the
subject of ET, UFO,

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:84%
the way this whole thing
is being paraded out now

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that all ETs are
a threat, they're

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:84%
here to take us down and wipe
out our military capabilities.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:84%
This stuff is now on mainstream
media, on the today show,

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:90%
on news programs.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm so bored with it.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:84%
It's so flat and
one-dimensional.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.670 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really
need to go there.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:90%
We can, but we don't need to.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's move on to
the AI part of it.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So looking at the
notion that AI,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.490 align:middle line:84%
there's a particular
agenda having

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to do with consciousness
and the control

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and influence these various
entities are exerting

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:90%
over humanity, playing with us.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
How do you perceive AI
fitting into this notion

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.895 align:middle line:90%
of being played with?

00:19:23.895 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to ask you how

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.812 align:middle line:84%
you would suggest
to people that they

00:19:26.812 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
can tell the difference between
entities who are actually there

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:84%
for a little trickery and
a little fun versus those

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:90%
who are really here to help.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.190 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to that
after this question.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah, so the AI
agenda is really one that is

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
quite demonic in its intent, and
it's because it's coming from

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:84%
a very interesting
and specific paradigm.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand that first
if we want to really understand

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:84%
from a mature and from an
objective perception, what

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.030 align:middle line:84%
this paradigm that's being
invited, that we are being

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:90%
invited, into is coming from.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:12.070 align:middle line:10%
It's coming from a paradigm
that does not believe that it

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:10%
has to adhere to natural law.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.040 align:middle line:84%
It's coming first in
a paradigm that it

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.130 align:middle line:90%
can create its own natural law.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So before anything, I'd
like to almost paint

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.360 align:middle line:84%
this kind of how Darth
Vader became Darth Vader.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
villain backstory

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.863 align:middle line:84%
before we can actually
start seeing--

00:20:32.863 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Go for it and
I'll add some things.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: OK, great.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's coming first
from a perception that--

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and it can get more
maniacal a few steps ahead.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:46.870 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's
almost look at it

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
like this innocent
thought in creation.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And this innocent
thought in creation

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:84%
was while I'm a creator
being, I can create.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to explore my
capacities of being a magician.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to explore my
capacities for creating.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you take
that thought form,

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:84%
but you start infusing
it with dominance

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to dominate other
people's willingness to create,

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:84%
other people's
ability to create.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is the
step in all of this

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:84%
where the seeds of the
transhumanism and AI agenda

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:90%
come from.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.750 align:middle line:10%
It comes from that but
way further down the road.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So first, it's coming from
this capability to do,

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:84%
which is funny because
it's false alchemy.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.950 align:middle line:84%
We talked earlier about how
alchemy is the interface

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:90%
between art and nature.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's how you use
your spiritual vessel,

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:84%
it's how you use your
spirit and your soul,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:84%
with your body-- mind,
body, spirit with nature.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're, together, creating
the alchemical process.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.240 align:middle line:84%
You're not taking
nature and you're not

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.800 align:middle line:84%
taking art and pitting
them against each other.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
considered alchemy.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, false alchemy
or dark alchemy

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:84%
is when now you
start saying, hey,

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:84%
if I could take my art, which
is my consciousness and my will,

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and I could do nature
better than nature,

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:84%
now you're not
even taking nature

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:84%
at that point, which is reality,
and saying, I honor the process

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going along
with the process.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:10%
Now you're going, hey, wait
a second, I can take nature

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:10%
and I can make my own nature.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.570 align:middle line:10%
I can make my own reality.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So now, what you have
at its very core,

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:84%
is a thought form in
creation that says,

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I can not have to
answer to universal law.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.880 align:middle line:90%
I can not to answer to karma.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:10%
I can take with this
transhumanism agenda what

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:10%
its seeds are, is saying
I can be my own god

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.027 align:middle line:10%
and I can dominate others with
this, using this technology.

00:22:55.027 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is also an
extension of the beings that

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.610 align:middle line:84%
have been here for many,
many, many thousands of years

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:00.645 align:middle line:90%
in the shadows.

00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:84%
They've been exerting
themselves in that way.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Now we have an interface, a
technology that they're actually

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
getting a buy-in
from humanity with,

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have to
try to exert muscle

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.570 align:middle line:84%
when you're having people
step into it voluntarily.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:10%
And a number of years
ago when AI was first

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:10%
starting to be written
about and chatted about,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:10%
I started looking into a
lot the development of it,

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:10%
who was behind it.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the places
it led me was MIT.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to MIT
and started looking,

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the roster
of the primary people

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:90%
working in their AI development.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And I can say this, I
think with certainty,

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:84%
there's a fair
amount of certainty.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.610 align:middle line:84%
It appeared, reading
about each person,

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
every person was
absolutely atheistic

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
in the truest sense of the word,
that there is no universal law,

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:52.162 align:middle line:84%
there is no guiding or higher
intelligence of any kind.

00:23:52.162 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not talking
about religious.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:84%
When I say atheism, it
means no belief in anything

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
more intelligent than
your own personal god

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that you've created
for yourself.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.360 align:middle line:84%
You, and the technology now,
by an extension of that.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So what I found was
exactly in alignment

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:84%
with what you're saying, even
down to an institutional level.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yes.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And atheism, how you
pointed out the nuance

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.310 align:middle line:84%
is so important because
right now, we're

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of inflammation, so
we can't hear about anything

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
without really placing on it
our own projections first.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.530 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at
atheism, not as it being,

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:90%
well, atheism is bad--

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.223 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Doesn't
mean non-Christian,

00:24:31.223 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:90%
non Judeo-Christian, non-- no.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.760 align:middle line:90%
That's not it.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.302 align:middle line:90%
You explain what it is.

00:24:35.302 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: No, you're
absolutely right.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a false dialectic.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a dialectic
to go atheism, bad,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:90%
that means religion is good.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So humanity is caught
in a false dialectic.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, constantly.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, we
project things onto anything.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And that would keep us
at the most basic level

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
that we have power and
agency to exercise,

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that would keep us
away from having

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.920 align:middle line:90%
true intimacy with anything.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.150 align:middle line:10%
Because if we just
look at atheism now,

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:10%
how you portrayed
it as it not being

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:10%
this thing that means that,
well, that religion is positive.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.520 align:middle line:10%
Now, if we just look
at atheism, it's

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.890 align:middle line:10%
coming from a belief
that not against a God,

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:10%
but just having them be the
core, most dominant, powerful

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.550 align:middle line:10%
will.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Correct.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you create an
extended technology of that,

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:90%
that's the corrupted base of it.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yes.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.680 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: To assume,
like you said,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:10%
there are no universal laws,
there are no laws of nature that

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:10%
supersede your creation and what
you're going to perpetuate upon

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:42.470 align:middle line:10%
the public.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: That's also known
as the corruption of the term do

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:90%
as thou wilt.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, now
what do you see--

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you already
explained it very nicely,

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.430 align:middle line:84%
but any extension
of what you just

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:84%
said about our interfacing with
it because it's being made,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.370 align:middle line:84%
like everything
beguiling and sexy,

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
as something that this will
make your life so easy.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Jump in, jump onto
the AI bandwagon.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you
respond to that

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.340 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of your
followers, a lot

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:84%
of young people who are now
playing with AI quite a bit

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:90%
because it makes things easier?

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:84%
You can write a term
paper faster with AI.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: I, funny enough,
attract a lot of people who are

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.570 align:middle line:90%
deep into AI and AI--

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:90%
How do you speak to them?

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: I tell them, I have
to go all the way radical this

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.470 align:middle line:84%
way because by the time
it reaches the mainstream,

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.980 align:middle line:84%
it's going to get so diluted
that they might pull away

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.910 align:middle line:84%
something that helps
balance them out.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:44.868 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I see, yeah.

00:26:44.868 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: So because of that,
I feel like I have to be a lot

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:52.780 align:middle line:84%
more stern on this topic just
because there's not enough

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:84%
voices amplifying
this reality of AI.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot more
power and momentum that's

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:84%
amplifying the reality of,
oh, AI is how you evolve.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:10%
And that's the
de-evolutionary pathway.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.900 align:middle line:84%
That is actually
what it would look

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.960 align:middle line:84%
like to a being that is,
one, wanting to assert

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:90%
its will over another.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And so because of that, it
is a service to self-pathway.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It's selling you evolution
when it's actually

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.520 align:middle line:90%
a pathway of de-evolution.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I
agree with you on that.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to avoid it.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It's ever been throughout
the universe forever.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.235 align:middle line:84%
It was destined
to be here again.

00:27:36.235 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not the first
time it's been here.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.230 align:middle line:90%
We have ancient, ancient times--

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:84%
AI already existed,
but it's always,

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:84%
depending on the nature of
the subtlety of the beings

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.700 align:middle line:84%
in a given planet or region
or quadrant of the universe,

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:84%
we always have to
decide how we're

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.030 align:middle line:84%
going to interface with this
very de-evolutionary thing

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.210 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're at that huge
choice point right now.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:00.840 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to engage?

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.180 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to teach
our children to engage?

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.480 align:middle line:84%
What do we carve out
as our uniqueness

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.760 align:middle line:84%
as human beings and our
own evolutionary path?

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what you're just

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.330 align:middle line:84%
addressing with your
audience, it sounds like.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah, and
if humanity had a level

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that can
reflect healthy technology,

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:84%
this would all be in
balance and proportion.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So it would not be something
that would degenerate us.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
and we can do that.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:26.445 align:middle line:90%
We can take it there.

00:28:26.445 --> 00:28:27.445 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Absolutely.

00:28:27.445 --> 00:28:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We can control
the outcome of it.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think people are often
fearing that because we're

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.135 align:middle line:84%
saying these things, oh
my god, the game is over

00:28:36.135 --> 00:28:38.510 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to take--
it's not going to take over.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:90%
That's up to us.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: No, not at all.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.877 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, it could help

00:28:41.877 --> 00:28:44.140 align:middle line:84%
a person propel
their own evolution

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.980 align:middle line:84%
as long as they're aware of what
is the positive technology that

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.560 align:middle line:84%
can help us evolve and what is
the negative and detrimental

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.448 align:middle line:84%
technology that's meant
to literally not help us.

00:28:54.448 --> 00:28:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: --devolve.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and one of
the areas that you come back

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:84%
to constantly, as do I,
is the nature of freewill.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And it is such a loaded topic,
and I became very annoyed

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.490 align:middle line:84%
about a year ago,
almost a year ago,

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.420 align:middle line:84%
when an author came out with
a book called Determined,

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Robert Sapolsky
out of Stanford.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is complex
and interesting,

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:84%
which is why it's important
for us to talk about it

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.040 align:middle line:84%
because people are being guided
away from freewill with AI.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one of the
agents that's taking people away

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.940 align:middle line:90%
from their own freewill.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Freely just giving up
their will to this thing.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So he was doing a
wonderful job in detailing

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:84%
all the different scientific
experiments where something

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.720 align:middle line:84%
was predetermined because of a
cellular reaction on some level.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And he did a great job,
and he had a line in there

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.780 align:middle line:84%
in the first 50 pages of
the book basically saying,

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.680 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, who knows
what consciousness, come on.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Blew right past that and
wrote a book on freewill

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't
believe there's

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:84%
anything higher than his
own perception and mind.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
complexities of freewill,

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.880 align:middle line:90%
because it's very complex.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because it's
not what he said was wrong.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's true.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:17.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're meat, a biochemical
sack of meat, that's all true.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things
are predetermined.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Your reaction will
be predetermined,

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.922 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't have to do with
the consciousness you possess.

00:30:24.922 --> 00:30:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah, and
that's actually speaking

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.000 align:middle line:84%
to what's called in
mysticism, the general law.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.840 align:middle line:84%
That's talking about the
lowest level of reality.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's higher
levels of reality

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:38.490 align:middle line:84%
that a person can
access, and that

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.890 align:middle line:84%
is being accessed the
more that we evolve.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.668 align:middle line:84%
And this was known in mysticism
through Gurdjieff's work, which

00:30:45.668 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:90%
is I come from, The Fourth Way.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So Gurdjieff's works talks
about these different octaves

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and how many laws have to guide
and govern a consciousness

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.550 align:middle line:84%
until that consciousness can
start supporting an awakening,

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.750 align:middle line:90%
and then less laws guard you.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:05.868 align:middle line:84%
So what he's talking about is
actually the base consciousness.

00:31:05.868 --> 00:31:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The very base.

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:10.050 align:middle line:10%
>> ELKHALDY: What he's pointing
to and what all physics

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.078 align:middle line:10%
at the moment has been pointing
to, and then they get confused

00:31:13.078 --> 00:31:15.120 align:middle line:10%
and they come back to the
drawing board about it,

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.810 align:middle line:10%
is they're pointing
to particle physics.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: And they're
basically saying, look,

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.970 align:middle line:84%
their strongest
argument is quite sick.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Their strongest argument
was using this example

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:30.030 align:middle line:84%
of a man who could not help his
sexual perversions because he

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:90%
had a tumor in his pineal gland.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: These
kinds of instances,

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:90%
the book is full of these.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: OK.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I'm aware
of all of them,

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and this is their
strongest point.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually not
making them look bad.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you their
strongest argument.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.355 align:middle line:90%
I'm being fair.

00:31:44.355 --> 00:31:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I am, too.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:46.522 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: It's kind of sick.

00:31:46.522 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I am,
too, because yes,

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that's accurate on
a biochemical level.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But this has nothing
to do with the totality

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.100 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
of the human being.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.058 align:middle line:84%
In their world, the human
being doesn't possess a soul.

00:32:01.058 --> 00:32:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Right.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So of course,
they're going to come to these

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:04.710 align:middle line:90%
conclusions.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
really ticked me off

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.050 align:middle line:84%
is you don't hear about
the subject of freewill

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:12.320 align:middle line:84%
in its grandest, most complex
sense ever making the news.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.380 align:middle line:84%
This thing was in every major
publication within two weeks

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.820 align:middle line:90%
of its release.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.500 align:middle line:10%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah, I mean,
that doesn't surprise me,

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.890 align:middle line:10%
but the narratives that want to
get pushed are the ones that get

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:24.690 align:middle line:10%
pushed.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.510 align:middle line:10%
You could look at them
like a sea of them

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.910 align:middle line:10%
and whichever ones
just fit and tailor

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:10%
to create the narrative
that you want to create,

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:10%
those are the ones
that get amplified.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones
that get pushed

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and those are the ones we
become the most aware of.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:39.500 align:middle line:84%
When I saw how particle
physics was really

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:84%
at the origins of how there's
no such thing as freewill,

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:84%
all that did was
just make me go,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:84%
am I smarter than the
smartest people alive?

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I know, I'm
thinking the same thing.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Am I just--

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:52.937 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it's just you're
more expanded in your awareness.

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:55.380 align:middle line:84%
These people are
intellectually-endowed,

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
but they have no
understanding of anything

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.280 align:middle line:84%
beyond that level, that
base level of consciousness.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: Well, they're
just too smart to function.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're
too smart to function.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.278 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I
bring this up is

00:33:06.278 --> 00:33:07.570 align:middle line:90%
because you and I are chatting.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:84%
We have a wonderful
audience here.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:84%
These are really lovely
souls that are watching.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And most of them
know these things

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:16.860 align:middle line:84%
innately that
we're talking about

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and love having either
new information to guide

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:84%
them or reinforcement of
things that they already know.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.310 align:middle line:10%
But this is a subject that
has to go to the mainstream

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:27.430 align:middle line:10%
ultimately.

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And so getting this message
out in the most palatable way

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.650 align:middle line:84%
to the public is really
what I'm interested in,

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.210 align:middle line:90%
to the public at large.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Absolutely.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How do
you approach that?

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: So freewill needs
to be obscured so that we

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:45.310 align:middle line:90%
don't access it.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's so
much confusion around there.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:51.960 align:middle line:84%
What freewill actually does
is anchor a being's awareness

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.430 align:middle line:90%
into their timeline.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.560 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that
they would be on what

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:90%
we would know as destiny.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.867 align:middle line:90%
We would be accessing destiny.

00:33:58.867 --> 00:34:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Determined,
destined, yeah.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:10%
>> ELKHALDY: So we would be
accessing the higher levels,

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.570 align:middle line:10%
the higher potentials
for a paradigm shift,

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.679 align:middle line:10%
the higher potentials for our
personal life if we actually

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:13.350 align:middle line:10%
start asserting and becoming
aware and accessing more

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.469 align:middle line:10%
and more freewill.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.580 align:middle line:10%
So we could even look at this
as the evolutionary journey is

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:10%
the development
of the willpower,

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.100 align:middle line:10%
and the development of the
willpower would be one that--

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.810 align:middle line:10%
it goes back to the
alchemical journey,

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:10%
it all comes back to alchemy--

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.150 align:middle line:10%
be going through the
process that's already

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:10%
happening that I call
ascension or evolution,

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.219 align:middle line:10%
but that participating
in that because you

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.840 align:middle line:10%
have to participate in nature.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.210 align:middle line:84%
We have to become
aware of things.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.989 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
in mysticism, knows

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:46.280 align:middle line:90%
as giving you more freewill.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.052 align:middle line:84%
We get a little bit of
freewill, just a little bit.

00:34:49.052 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:84%
And that's what--
particle physics

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.159 align:middle line:90%
or the tumor in your brain.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:55.159 align:middle line:84%
And then we grow from
that by using it,

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.560 align:middle line:84%
by exercising it
like a feedback loop.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
takeaway about freewill

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.220 align:middle line:84%
is understanding
that it actually

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.420 align:middle line:90%
anchors you in a positive way.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:09.430 align:middle line:84%
It anchors your awareness
into a timeline that cannot be

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.900 align:middle line:84%
obstructed, it cannot
be interfered with.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's so
much confusion around it,

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.190 align:middle line:84%
it's because then
you can just go

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:84%
into the collective general
law and there's a lot more--

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:84%
there's more forces in
the general law that

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:28.580 align:middle line:84%
can overpower a person's
consciousness if that person's

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.903 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is not stepping
into their sovereignty.

00:35:30.903 --> 00:35:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: So spiritual
sovereignty is another way

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.920 align:middle line:90%
of saying freewill.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:10%
There's so many different ways
to describe this same process,

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:10%
but really, it's one of
saying that, by default,

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:50.900 align:middle line:10%
some other fate, you will be
a part of if you do not anchor

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.950 align:middle line:10%
your freewill into a timeline
where it would eventually

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:middle line:10%
lead to a person's destiny,
it would eventually

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.270 align:middle line:10%
lead to what their highest
potential would be.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.790 align:middle line:10%
And that is beyond
the general law.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.970 align:middle line:10%
That is beyond the
collective fate.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this
fate versus destiny,

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and destiny being that
higher-self version of reality.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So with that, how you get any
of that is through freewill.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:20.810 align:middle line:10%
Because of that, freewill is
now looked at like an illusion

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:10%
or it's looked as
a religious notion.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.950 align:middle line:84%
It's purposely put
into a division.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It's just made to
look like either

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.180 align:middle line:84%
or, it's made to look
like the other way, all

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:35.160 align:middle line:84%
because it's so powerful you
have to dissect it and turn it

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:84%
into these hyper-divisions
of religion

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.860 align:middle line:84%
or it being an
illusion specifically

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.605 align:middle line:84%
to confuse you from not
accessing it and applying it.

00:36:44.605 --> 00:36:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well said.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I totally agree
with all of that.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:84%
It's very well, you
said it very well.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And so then the
question becomes,

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.960 align:middle line:84%
when we're utilizing our
freewill, what aspect of self

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.230 align:middle line:90%
are we listening to?

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:59.310 align:middle line:10%
And that's the confusing
part, because the,

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.580 align:middle line:10%
kind of hermetically
speaking, lower mind part that

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.810 align:middle line:10%
also has to do with
biochemical responses,

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:10%
addictions, ancestral
patterns, all of that

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:10%
stuff that we're
impregnated with at birth.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, that's true,
we're steeped in that stew.

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:15.300 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't have anything
to do with that higher

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:19.050 align:middle line:84%
aspect of ourselves that is here
to discern what we live with

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and what we let go
of, and then what

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.380 align:middle line:90%
we start magnetizing toward.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And that has to come from
the higher mind/soul complex.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So as a teacher of
your generation,

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.910 align:middle line:84%
how do you explain to
people the best way

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and a very practical
mechanical terms

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.750 align:middle line:84%
to connect to their higher self
so that the decisions they make

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:44.170 align:middle line:84%
are in alignment with their soul
and the soul's desire to express

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.650 align:middle line:90%
something in this lifetime?

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Dharma or whatnot.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: I view the higher
mind as being the guiding light

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.020 align:middle line:84%
or the guidance
for the lower mind.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And the connection between the
higher mind, guiding and helping

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:59.720 align:middle line:84%
integrate and heal
the lower mind

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.072 align:middle line:84%
would actually be done
through the emotional body.

00:38:02.072 --> 00:38:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was talking about

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.900 align:middle line:84%
earlier about the whole
journey is actually

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.650 align:middle line:90%
a development of the will.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.210 align:middle line:84%
The willpower is
our emotional body.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Our emotional body is not
separate from the will.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It's almost what drives,
what informs our--

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Desire?

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yes.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So what drives what
informs the will?

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Desire.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.650 align:middle line:84%
So this whole
process of evolution

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.660 align:middle line:84%
is actually one
where the higher mind

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:33.890 align:middle line:84%
you could look at as being
already in an enlightened state.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:36.350 align:middle line:84%
The higher mind is
guiding the lower mind

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:40.080 align:middle line:84%
through a cleansing process
of the emotional body.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So it has to do
with things, almost

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:47.670 align:middle line:84%
you could look at in the sense
of the mind is acting out

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.630 align:middle line:84%
in a way because it
has not had equilibrium

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:middle line:90%
with the emotional body.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.160 align:middle line:10%
And once you see
that equilibrium rise

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.250 align:middle line:10%
with the emotional body,
then the lower mind

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.370 align:middle line:10%
is the higher mind,
the lower mind has--

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:06.000 align:middle line:10%
the inflammation of the
lower mind has calmed down

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.610 align:middle line:10%
and it's no more and it's
integrated into the higher mind.

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So the lower mind will never
be able to figure out the lower

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:90%
mind through the lower mind.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, and that's
all we use day to day.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.645 align:middle line:90%
We only use the lower mind.

00:39:18.645 --> 00:39:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
important to point.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like hermetic
languaging, because the lower

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:27.270 align:middle line:84%
mind-- you're absolutely right--
it's the functional part that

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:30.800 align:middle line:84%
keeps us on time and getting the
groceries and feeding our kids

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.600 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.100 align:middle line:90%
That's lower mind activity.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:84%
But the infusion and connection
between the higher mind

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and lower mind is tricky
when you have so much noise,

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.890 align:middle line:90%
distraction, and manipulation.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And so the mechanics
of being able to hear

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.990 align:middle line:84%
this little voice, this
wonderful voice whispering

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.450 align:middle line:84%
to us constantly
of the higher mind

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and not being distracted
by these lower mind

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.260 align:middle line:84%
messages and such is, to me,
that's the Holy Grail right now.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yes.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.268 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --the higher mind.

00:40:01.268 --> 00:40:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: And it all comes
back to really basic things

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:08.370 align:middle line:84%
because, remember, the emotional
body or the will is not

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:11.260 align:middle line:90%
as developed as the higher mind.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So because of that, its
steps look super basic

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and we overpass
them all the time

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.630 align:middle line:84%
because our emotional
body is that

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:19.900 align:middle line:90%
of almost like kindergartens.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: So because of that,
it just looks like things that

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.740 align:middle line:90%
look like developmental wounds.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:26.615 align:middle line:90%
So many times--

00:40:26.615 --> 00:40:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's true.

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: But so many
times, I can see that a person

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:33.480 align:middle line:84%
doesn't understand what I'm
saying in esoteric teachings

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.840 align:middle line:90%
and esoteric knowledge.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.970 align:middle line:10%
And it's not because
of esotericism at all.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:39.690 align:middle line:84%
It's because
developmental wounds.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Developmental issues
are exactly what

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.840 align:middle line:84%
needs to be healed
in order for us

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:84%
to be integrated
into the higher mind.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So because of that, we
need to look at things

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.790 align:middle line:84%
from a very honest, very
transparent lens, which

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:58.170 align:middle line:90%
is I have shame arise.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm jealous.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:10%
Very basic things
that we had not

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:07.270 align:middle line:10%
been able to really honor
and be super honest about.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.990 align:middle line:10%
And that's actually what's
going to help not just the lower

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:12.760 align:middle line:10%
mind, that's going to be
pretty much the assignment.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.560 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That is.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the hard work
on earth right now.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Exactly contending
with these feelings

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.340 align:middle line:84%
we have and not
self-flagellation over them.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.690 align:middle line:90%
We all have them.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:28.110 align:middle line:84%
We have been programmed to
have those influences stronger

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.230 align:middle line:90%
in our field.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.530 align:middle line:10%
Everything around us
and surrounding us

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:10%
has been to make us feel
shameful of what we are,

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.120 align:middle line:10%
which is an agenda.

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.560 align:middle line:90%
And again, same thing.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.370 align:middle line:84%
We keep going back
to the same agendas.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, being run through
technology, which I

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.810 align:middle line:84%
take great exception to
on behalf of humanity.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I do not like what's
going on here.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So listening to the subtlety
and beauty, like you say,

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:51.640 align:middle line:90%
you have the emotions.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.310 align:middle line:84%
We have to contend
with them and learn

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:57.340 align:middle line:84%
to allow them to just be and
to love them and say it's OK.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.890 align:middle line:84%
These are natural
feelings, but I

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.660 align:middle line:84%
think we can do better
as we move along here.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're doing,
purifying the emotions.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's in connection with
the lower mind already,

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:10.320 align:middle line:84%
but cleaning ourselves
up enough emotionally

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.110 align:middle line:84%
to where the messages that
we'll hear from the higher mind

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:14.200 align:middle line:90%
are not a threat.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Those directives,
we say, yeah, I

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.820 align:middle line:90%
can do that, I can embrace that.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.310 align:middle line:10%
And then the desire
becomes so strong,

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:23.460 align:middle line:10%
which is a very
higher form, a higher

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.830 align:middle line:10%
form of expression of the
emotions in its pure sense.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:10%
>> ELKHALDY: Well, it's
the de-armoring of the ego.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, a
good way to put it.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.050 align:middle line:84%
That's our own barriers are
ones of either inferiority

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:41.190 align:middle line:84%
or superiority, and that's just
keeping a lot of distraction

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:43.210 align:middle line:84%
internally, a lot of
internal conflict.

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:46.480 align:middle line:84%
We oscillate in between
inferiority superiority.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The de-armoring is what
actually just allows

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.745 align:middle line:84%
what's already naturally
there, the higher self.

00:42:52.745 --> 00:42:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just to accept it
in ourselves and each other.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.940 align:middle line:90%
We're all flawed.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:90%
We're humans.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.370 align:middle line:90%
We're still on this plane.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:59.390 align:middle line:90%
We have work to do.

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:00.200 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.280 align:middle line:84%
But again, what you
say about allowing

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.490 align:middle line:84%
the lower mind and the emotions
to come into more balance

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:09.790 align:middle line:84%
so that they can begin marrying
and communicating clearly

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.270 align:middle line:90%
with the higher mind.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.210 align:middle line:84%
That's where our
freewill comes in

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.900 align:middle line:84%
as a beautiful element
of life and not directed

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.430 align:middle line:90%
by lower subconscious desires.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.450 align:middle line:90%
That's different.

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Those are, I mean,
addictions and such, right?

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And whatever we
don't become aware of

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.680 align:middle line:84%
could somehow be used against
us in the court of the universe.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So really, the more
aware we become,

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:36.440 align:middle line:84%
the more we could go, OK,
wow, that triggered me.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Why did that trigger me?

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:39.470 align:middle line:90%
That is all freewill.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Because now we are
not just a robot.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.810 align:middle line:90%
We are not just--

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A response.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>> ELKHALDY: --a response,
a reflex to our environment.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Now we have presence.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.240 align:middle line:84%
We have awareness that
gives us more agency.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I absolutely
agree with you.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:56.480 align:middle line:84%
We're in alignment on
a lot of things here.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.897 align:middle line:10%
We could sit and chat all day
about a few of these things,

00:43:58.897 --> 00:44:01.990 align:middle line:10%
but we're almost out of time,
so any final thoughts you have

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.910 align:middle line:10%
that you want to
pass on to viewers

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:08.200 align:middle line:10%
to take home and use a little
tool of some kind here.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.000 align:middle line:10%
>> ELKHALDY: Yeah,
I do a daily thing.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.140 align:middle line:90%
It comes quite natural.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.640 align:middle line:90%
I laugh at myself.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I laugh at myself because that
de-armors the ego, the lower

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:18.620 align:middle line:90%
mind the most.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.680 align:middle line:10%
I laugh at myself because
when you're laughing,

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.560 align:middle line:10%
that's actually your higher
self and you connecting more.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.560 align:middle line:10%
So I think that the more
we can laugh at ourselves,

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.360 align:middle line:10%
what we're doing,
it's not weakness,

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:10%
it's not weakness at all.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:38.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a remarkable strength to
be able to look at ourselves

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.660 align:middle line:84%
or even the predicaments
we're in or even just whatever

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:45.290 align:middle line:84%
it that is really keeping
us in a hypertension

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:46.680 align:middle line:90%
and laugh at ourselves.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And what that
actually ends up doing

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:51.390 align:middle line:84%
is allowing that de-armoring
process to happen.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:54.530 align:middle line:10%
And that allows the alignment
of our emotional body

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:55.650 align:middle line:10%
to come in more.

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:59.060 align:middle line:10%
The reason why we don't laugh
as much about our predicaments

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:02.630 align:middle line:10%
or the divine comedy
is specifically

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.180 align:middle line:10%
in degree with how
much freewill we have.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's ultimately
why the Divine Comedy

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.250 align:middle line:90%
was called The Divine Comedy.

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:13.650 align:middle line:10%
So I would like the audience
to know that the Divine Comedy,

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.610 align:middle line:10%
if we could see
that, we already have

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:19.400 align:middle line:10%
more spiritual sovereignty
because we understand

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.653 align:middle line:10%
that we can laugh with it.

00:45:20.653 --> 00:45:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hear, hear.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Totally agree with that one.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Start the day with it.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Sarah.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.590 align:middle line:84%

brilliant insights today,

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure we'll
be seeing you again.

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:31.280 align:middle line:90%

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.113 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To learn
