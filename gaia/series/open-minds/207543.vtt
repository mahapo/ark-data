readings of Edgar Cayce,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.260 align:middle line:84%
he said, Crystal has two
main purposes upon the Earth.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.960 align:middle line:84%
The first and most
important is communication

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.040 align:middle line:90%
with other dimensions.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.300 align:middle line:84%
The second one is
technology, memory.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Our whole computer industry
depends on crystal.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:84%
We would not have any
computer without the crystal.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
jump out of that,

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:84%
we have to learn to go
into the world of magic.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And that world of
magic is best known

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
by the Indigenous
societies, because they were

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:90%
the first ones to be in awe.

what does that mean?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:84%
It means we're being pitted
against each other now.

and to react to the environment
they were thrown into.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's thrown into
a different environment,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%

designed, because each land--

I always talk about the
five different places that--

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I got the first idea
of it in the readings

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%

five regions, which

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
are assigned to
color, which matches

with the races and the senses.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:90%

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We did, but
we can go back into it,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%

>>TARPEY: OK.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, I first got the idea
from Edgar Cayce's readings.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.130 align:middle line:84%
There was an entity who lived
in Atlantis 98,000 years

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
before the arrival
of Ram in India.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:90%
Good luck with that.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm still working on it.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.282 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK with that.

00:05:12.282 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%

with those numbers.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.540 align:middle line:90%

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And you just look
up in the index.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's the key to the readings
and the amazing testimony that

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:90%
came through him to the world.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From Amilius?

Through Edgar from Amilius?

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: This was just
knowledge of Amilius

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:90%
through the Akashic source.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And he explained
it as he would go--

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
he was caught by the
hypnotists, the second circus

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:84%
after the elephant circus
in the rural areas.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
The hypnotic circus
came through,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and they discovered that this
guy, when you hypnotized him,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%
had some unusual--

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting chills-- had some
very unusual information.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And they learned that if
you asked him questions,

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:90%
he could see all through you.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And he would face
his head north,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and he would lay on
a sofa, go to sleep.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And if his eyes fluttered,
he went into the trance.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.770 align:middle line:90%
If not, he went to sleep.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.765 align:middle line:84%
So he went to that place
between waking and sleeping.

00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're talking
about Amilius at this time?

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: No, we're
talking about Edgar Cayce.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:90%

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Cayce.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:84%

up for the reading.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, he is.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And the hypnotist found out
how to be his conductor.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:90%
But they couldn't trust anybody.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Only his wife could do it.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:90%
I would pick my wife too.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
most of our audience

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:84%
is familiar with Edgar
Cayce and his work,

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
but most people are not
familiar with Amilius.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
way it was done,

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:90%
and he started curing people.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:84%
He would say, yes,
I have the soul.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And then-- yes,
we have the soul.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Not I. Yes, we have the soul.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
recommend some remedy.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:84%
These are people that were
hopeless cases, many of them.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And he started curing them and
getting into the newspapers.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, even
so much that they'd say,

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:90%
go to your pharmacy.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
dark blue bottle

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
behind a dusty bottle with
something else in front of it.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:90%
And they'd say, what?

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:90%
The pharmacist-- what?

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And there it was.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.218 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: They didn't
know it was on the shelf.

00:07:27.218 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:90%
It was called oil of smoke.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:90%
Oil of smoke.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:10%
And so there's a book
"There is a River,"

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:10%
and that is one I
recommend to read

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.778 align:middle line:10%
to get the full panorama
of his life and his work.

00:07:37.778 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Beautiful book.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:10%
Going on.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:90%
So now let's get to Amilius.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Amilius was
an entity in Atlantis.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And he found that the souls
that first came here, we

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:84%
had the power of thought
creation when we first came in.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.478 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we wanted,
we could produce.

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chills, chills.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The problem
is, we kept producing

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.965 align:middle line:90%
and we forgot who we were.

00:08:05.965 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We got so involved
with the creation

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that we became the creation and
we forgot our spirit legacy.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:90%
That was one of his main points.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
power that's inside

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.967 align:middle line:84%
of us that we have to
learn to connect with now,

00:08:22.967 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
need every bit of it.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And the legacy of at one
time in another form,

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:84%
being able to create at
the speed of thought.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.778 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this, I
think, is our frustration

00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:38.690 align:middle line:84%
in this world with creation,
with manifestation, with time,

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.049 align:middle line:84%
is this deep anxiety,
because some deep part of us

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
remembers we were able to
create at the speed of thought,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:90%
and now we can't do that.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to wait for
permissions and time

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and agreements, and it seems
like we can't create a dang

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.510 align:middle line:90%
thing a lot of times, you know?

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: What
I've found is there

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.090 align:middle line:84%
is a way to have
that power if we

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:02.187 align:middle line:90%
accept the dimension of magic.

00:09:02.187 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: This is a magic place.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.875 align:middle line:90%
This is a place--

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and the mind has to lose
its main role in it,

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
because our mind is conditioned
by propaganda, trauma

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:84%
from our early ages, and
sibling jealousies and all sorts

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.350 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Bullying, comparison
in school systems

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:84%
that are purported to be
education when it was not.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And it filled people
with trauma and fear.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And we are able to manipulate
each other with that fear.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
jump out of that,

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:84%
we have to learn to go
into the world of magic.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And that world of
magic is best known

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
by the Indigenous
societies, because they were

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.380 align:middle line:90%
the first ones to be in awe.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:90%
And in what the--

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
they imagined being just
nothing in the past, nothing

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:84%
in the future, just dealing with
this like a child coming out

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:90%
of the womb.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we
have to go back to them.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And my work is going
back into their world,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of them were
stamped out by empires.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And our recent empire
is what we call

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:84%
the European Judeo-Christian
Empire or the Holy Roman

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Empire.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:84%
The United States received
the baton from England.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:90%
It is now the Holy Roman Empire.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:84%
It's holy because we
swear on the bibles.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.880 align:middle line:90%
It has a religion at its base.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
terms are in Latin

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:90%
from the early church and Rome.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:90%
And so it's Holy and Roman.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And it passed all the
way from the Middle East,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:84%
going to Europe, to France, then
from Persia even before that.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks, then Rome,
then France, then Germany,

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and onto England, and
then to the United States.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there are so many
questions I could bring up now.

00:11:18.795 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:90%
We're way off script.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Let's have fun.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So what denoted
the time in which

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
the baton of the
Holy Roman Empire

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:90%
passed to the United States?

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: After
World War I. That

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle line:84%
was it, because the United
States came in to help.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:84%
It had this huge country
with unlimited resources.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.900 align:middle line:90%
There was no competition.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:90%
They had found a paradise here.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they helped because
the English and the French

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:90%
were losing.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And that's why they
went into the Middle East,

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and they decided to
divide up the Middle East.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
decided to create--

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
give Israel a chance
to have Palestine,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and they could pay
off debts in that way.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, have a
free zone for their trade

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:84%
so they could take
Iraq and other places

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and pass their oil and
everything through there

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:90%
without obstacle.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the Holy Roman--
this is not so holy an empire,

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the Holy
Roman part of it, I

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:84%
understand what you're saying,
this patriarchal period

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:84%
of history that's very wound
up in resources and banking

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.898 align:middle line:84%
and politics and
treachery, which

00:12:29.898 --> 00:12:32.065 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to the Roman
Catholic Church itself.

00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
They're all-- it's
human groups, basically.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Human groups.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Human groups.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.037 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what are
the implications--

00:12:39.037 --> 00:12:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and does this tie back
in to the Mayan race

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:84%
story in terms of the
red race of the Americas?

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And was this foreseen that the
baton of the end of patriarchy

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:90%
would really land here?

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:90%
Does it end here in America?

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: No.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where does it go next?

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: We have a lot of
other regions to consider.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: OK.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, we
have it right now.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.625 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where does it
go next, from what you

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:90%
understand at this point?

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The red region,
according to Edgar Cayce--

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and now I find verified
in the Hopi testimony--

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
these regions are-- because
the colors of the races

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.420 align:middle line:90%
are not by accident.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And as Cayce said, it's
not about race per se.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It's about a spiritual
vibration that

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
has come from where they were
born, where they started.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So the land has
programmed them in the way

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
that the intelligence
wanted them

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
to be programmed with the
destiny of coming together.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK so if we're
speaking now of his testimony

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.388 align:middle line:84%
of the red race, Edgar Cayce's
testimony, we're kind of--

00:13:52.388 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
let's just keep
going, and we'll just

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:84%
weave it all together-- what
was his profound testimony

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:90%
of the red race?

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: He said that
the red race is the one--

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the Americas.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: --in the Americas.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.187 align:middle line:84%
He said the Americas
and Atlantis.

00:14:07.187 --> 00:14:08.145 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Atlantis.

00:14:08.145 --> 00:14:08.945 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And the
red race is the one--

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:90%
the red is the color of feeling.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on the
five senses, the five

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:90%
areas, five different senses.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's the craziest
thing I ever read.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.110 align:middle line:90%
But I got into it.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:90%
My wife dragged me into it.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Women
do that with men.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
They go to meetings that they
never thought they would go to.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you're
wearing a little tin hat.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: In all the
Adam and Eve stories,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.790 align:middle line:90%
the women are the curious ones.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: [LAUGHS]

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So continue
on with this notion

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:84%
of Edgar Cayce's
perception and testimony

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:84%
of the red race, which is
the Americas and Atlantis.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And I want to add
something quickly.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
People who do hypnosis work,
intuitive work, and past life

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
journeying, it's
often brought up

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:84%
that the actual skin color of
one of the races in Atlantis

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:90%
was quite red.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Very red.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:84%
That they had actual
red skin as well.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this from
many different people who

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:84%
don't know each other, who've
been back into regressions

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:90%
into Atlantean times.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so
there were American--

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Cayce talked about the arrival
of pioneers from Atlantis

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.630 align:middle line:84%
during-- it was a long
process of their fall

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and their thinking, and so
they sent out expeditions

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.480 align:middle line:90%
This is not understood.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:84%
People think that whatever Plato
brought forward was really it,

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis was a
corrupt society that

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:90%
sank 12,000 years ago.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Not very many people go into
the depth of the history,

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.610 align:middle line:84%
the long period of history
and the multiple cataclysms

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis in lowering of
knowledge and frequency.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
They said it finally went
down around 13,000 years ago.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's a Mayan
American Indian number.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Then it's very close
with everybody else's

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.372 align:middle line:90%
that are coming up with their--

00:15:58.372 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And that's why we
have-- that's why we have 13--

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:90%
we had 13 colonies.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.665 align:middle line:84%
And now Canada has 13
territories and provinces

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:90%
all together.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.130 align:middle line:90%
There's no error.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No error.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:90%
So-- OK.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.728 align:middle line:84%
Now setting all that
up, what did Edgar Cayce

00:16:13.728 --> 00:16:15.020 align:middle line:90%
have to say about the red race?

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to go on
this trajectory of where

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:90%
this baton goes.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.915 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of hoping
it would end here.

00:16:20.915 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Hmm.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, you took me
to something else.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:84%
The baton always
moves west, he said.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it has
to go to Asia now.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the next stop.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.220 align:middle line:90%
China.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.412 align:middle line:84%
According to Vedic
astrology, it's China.

00:16:34.412 --> 00:16:36.725 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: I'm not sure.

00:16:36.725 --> 00:16:39.050 align:middle line:90%
I can only say what's happening.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's the Western
countries themselves

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.707 align:middle line:90%
that developed China.

00:16:45.707 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're all
partners in helping

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:50.812 align:middle line:90%
develop modern China.

00:16:50.812 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's right.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And China is set to change,
because I know the real China.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I studied in Taiwan, and
that's the traditional China.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell me all
about that, because people

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.050 align:middle line:90%
don't understand that China.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:90%
I was in the army.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:90%
They dragged me in.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:90%
I was drafted.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
And I was a company
clerk, a sergeant.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And I had this guy, a
captain, who was just

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:90%
harassing me all the time.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.329 align:middle line:84%
Your shoes are
not shined enough.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:24.230 align:middle line:84%
You look like a cardboard
box with your uniform.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.368 align:middle line:84%
I had to get out of there
to get my work done.

00:17:26.368 --> 00:17:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Your
accent's coming up.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so a circular
came around to study Vietnamese.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know
I was protected.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
My two brothers,
they made a mistake

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.530 align:middle line:84%
by assigning them to
the same combat unit,

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:90%
which is against the rules.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And so they came to my house.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know this,
but I was protected.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:90%
I could not go.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And to make up for
that, they said,

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.040 align:middle line:84%
your third son will never
go to a combat zone.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:90%
So you were a clerk.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
your linguistic studies.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: So I studied
Vietnamese, and I loved it.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:90%
I got into it.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.130 align:middle line:84%
It's so simple compared
to Western languages

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:84%
before the French
got a hold of it.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
Chinese, but they

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:84%
started writing in the
alphabet, because the French

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.040 align:middle line:90%
forced them to do that in 1868.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So they originally had
Chinese characters,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
but you still could see
the kanji thought in there.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And Chinese is my
favorite language,

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
have to study grammar,

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:90%
because the verbs never change.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:84%
There's no agreement
between any word.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
No masculine and
feminine, nothing.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.893 align:middle line:90%
Just put pictures together.

00:18:40.893 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So because you
actually understand Chinese

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and speak and read Chinese,
and by extension Southeast Asia

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
as well, what do you
see as the real kind

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of Chinese spiritual legacy
that exists still in this time?

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The great
scholars that I read

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:90%
about in China opened my eyes.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:90%
I was not a student.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I was not a researcher
when I lived there.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But because I studied
Vietnamese and I

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:84%
had a nice job in
New York, which

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I got through the ethnic
Irish unit there--

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:25.890 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] it's all about
ethnicities in New York

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and the special privileges
that different groups have.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to follow
up on the Vietnamese,

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:84%
but they had no
Vietnamese department,

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:90%
so I went into Chinese.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I took my master's degree
at St. John's University

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:90%
in New York.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I was right
there at the right time,

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:90%
and they gave me a scholarship.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:90%
They sent me right over.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I was just-- my whole
life was taken over by it.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:90%
And they gave me $100 a month.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:56.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And with that,
I could rent an apartment,

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:84%
have all my clothes
made to suit my size,

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.572 align:middle line:84%
and save money and enjoy
the heck out of myself.

00:20:04.572 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hard for
people to believe now,

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.750 align:middle line:90%
but it was absolutely true.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:84%
You lived for nothing in
Southeast Asia, Philippines,

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:90%
all of that.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:90%
So how do you--

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you learned a great deal
about the spirit and the heart

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.490 align:middle line:84%
of the Chinese and
the Chinese culture,

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.880 align:middle line:84%
which we can't see through
the materialistic lens today.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: We can't,
because each culture

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:84%
is surrounded by a filter
that they're unaware of.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:84%
They think they're
looking at China.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.920 align:middle line:90%
They have not experienced China.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.330 align:middle line:84%
They don't know her
like I know her.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.212 align:middle line:84%
China is just going
through a phase right now.

00:20:41.212 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a phase of Western
philosophy, Marxist Leninism.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not Chinese.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And their Native culture, it
produced Kongzi, Confucius,

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and Mengzi, and all these
tremendous [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.970 align:middle line:84%
all these tremendous scholars
that I studied about.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:90%
And in China, everybody studied.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was--
you couldn't even

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.860 align:middle line:84%
go to a park in the morning
without people doing exercises,

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:90%
the tai chi and everything.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Study is-- all their fairy
tales are about study

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:90%
for the examinations.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I think the examination
system of China

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:84%
was copied by England, along
with our tai that we use.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.062 align:middle line:90%
That's all Chinese.

00:21:25.062 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The tai is Chinese?

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And when we graduate,
we graduate in a Chinese gown.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And the little tassel
means the sharpness

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.908 align:middle line:84%
of the rice plant, the
intelligence of the rice plant.

00:21:39.908 --> 00:21:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just
love talking to you.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:84%
You are such a font
of incredibly esoteric

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: They saw through this.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:90%
So let's continue on then.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So then you have Marxism
which arrives on her shores,

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:84%
takes over the
culture, denigrates

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:90%
the spirit of the individuals.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:90%
All empires do.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: It's human--

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.782 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Including ours.

00:22:01.782 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It's our
fears together.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And our way to
gain false power is

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
to join with groups,
because we're

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:84%
desperate to be
accepted by anyone.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And so either in
high school, you

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:16.550 align:middle line:84%
joined the sports group
or the fashionable people

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:84%
or the goths, the
outsiders, the people

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
in the middle that had
their heads covered

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.730 align:middle line:90%
from artillery from all sides.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] There were 1,001
combinations possible.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And during
that time of high school

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:90%
is when it really forms up.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.740 align:middle line:90%
And you find your new friends.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Because of the competitiveness
of the whole education system,

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:39.530 align:middle line:90%
you sort of are--

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I remember riding on the subway
in New York to go to school.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to meet my
old friends because we

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:90%
were in competition now.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that way
in elementary school,

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.430 align:middle line:84%
but high school became
like a competition.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And everybody became afraid,
because you were measured.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's not real education.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.315 align:middle line:84%
That's the opposite
of education.

00:23:02.315 --> 00:23:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
that's really where

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:09.090 align:middle line:84%
we became stuck as a species,
is in this adolescent era

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:84%
of our lives where we're
competing and looking

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:90%
for acceptance.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back
for just one moment

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.875 align:middle line:84%
before we continue along the
Chinese tale and the passing

00:23:15.875 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
of the baton of
the Roman Empire.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:18.520 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go there.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about what
it is in our own being

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.580 align:middle line:84%
that we're
disconnected from that

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:84%
is keeping us stuck
in this adolescent--

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.210 align:middle line:84%
besides the other influences,
the propaganda-- stuck

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.820 align:middle line:84%
in this adolescent phase
of seeking acceptance

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:90%
at any price.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The
great revolutionary

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.120 align:middle line:90%
was Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.090 align:middle line:90%
He lived in Geneva.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.480 align:middle line:90%
French Swiss speaker.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote books
about human sensitivity.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:84%
He's the one inspired people
before the French Revolution.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:84%
He inspired that revolution,
going back to nature.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Because he said,
civilizations create

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:90%
people that have no self.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Their in-groups-- their
group identity is their self.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:84%
They don't commune with
nature by themselves.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
original thoughts.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.720 align:middle line:84%
They don't evaluate the
information by themselves,

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.150 align:middle line:84%
because they're in school
competing with each other

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.160 align:middle line:90%
over the common information.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
interesting and true.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, this
incredible species

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:90%
that-- what is his name?

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Amilius?

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That Amilius spoke
of, that had the ability

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:84%
to create at the
speed of thought.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Went through a devolution and
a forgetting and an amnesia.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here we are now.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So we can't connect with
self and the all naturally.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can, but I mean, it's
not easy to do that right now.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So now we're stuck
in a field of trying

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:84%
to become accepted on a
human common group level,

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:84%
just to feel connected
with anything.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So now we're buying
all the propaganda.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.523 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter where
you live in the world.

00:25:00.523 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:90%
We're all doing it.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to China
and what you know about--

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:84%
You're talking
about a people who

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:11.162 align:middle line:84%
are oriented toward discipline,
learning, knowledge.

00:25:11.162 --> 00:25:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the heart
and where the heart comes in

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.745 align:middle line:90%
in all of this, the heart--

00:25:14.745 --> 00:25:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The heart
is in all cultures.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:10%
What you look for
in any culture, what

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.765 align:middle line:10%
I look for in any
culture is what

00:25:20.765 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:10%
they want to teach their
children at the beginning.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And what do
they teach their children?

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And they want the
best for them, the most ideal,

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:84%
sharing, and being
kind to neighbors.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.940 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, it
gets more complex.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And then there are things
that happen in the society

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.550 align:middle line:84%
where it rains in one place and
it doesn't rain in the other.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:50.682 align:middle line:84%
And people say, why did they
get rain and we didn't get rain?

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:51.640 align:middle line:90%
We're better than them.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
They'll get a ruler
who will puff them

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.430 align:middle line:90%
up at how wonderful you are.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Why should they have that?

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:90%
You have the right to that rain.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:90%
And so extortion begins early.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:90%
There's an extortion racket.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:10.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So with that said, let's
go to the tossing of that--

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:84%
the passing of that baton from
the Americas, East, to as many

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:84%
predict and say is already
really occurring, to China.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And what does that-- what does
that look like to take the Holy

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Roman Empire and all
of the corruption--

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:84%
politically, economically,
and everything else--

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:84%
over now to Asia as
the premier stage.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It's just a
possibility, something

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:90%
that I read in Edgar Cayce.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:90%
And I happen to live in China.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And once you live with
them, you love them.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:84%
When I learned their language,
I created a Chinese person

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:90%
inside me.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm loyal to
nothing but the truth.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm not loyal to human groups.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Everything I know of
you, that is true.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.205 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:27:08.205 --> 00:27:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
they helped you?

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: They helped
me a great deal.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.310 align:middle line:90%
They're so kind.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:90%
So wonderful.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And the laughter and
the joy in that place.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I have many
Chinese friends,

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and they love when I
speak Chinese with them.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.112 align:middle line:90%
So we should not be enemies.

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We should
not be enemies.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the thing that
happened, politics came in.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And that started essentially
hypnotizing their culture.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:84%
We're being hypnotized
in other ways.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:84%
We're being told we're
competition to one another.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, everyone's doing
underneath the table deals

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:43.090 align:middle line:90%
the whole time anyway.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.815 align:middle line:84%
All of the people that
run the money show

00:27:44.815 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:84%
are always doing
deals, regardless

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:48.160 align:middle line:90%
of what the politics says.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.120 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And now we have China in a
very similar situation to ours.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:56.500 align:middle line:84%
The flow of inequity and wealth
has all flowed to the top,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and the people are
left the same as they

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.250 align:middle line:84%
are in the United States
and elsewhere in the world.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So what is this
passing of the baton?

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:84%
What could it look
like or even mean?

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It's a
complicated scenario,

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:84%
but there is always an
answer, because this place is

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:90%
made from love.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And all we have to do
is get our mind out

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:84%
of the way just a part of
the day, and it will begin.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.600 align:middle line:90%
The magic can begin.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I facilitate
shamanship in people,

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.230 align:middle line:90%
and that is the answer.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.780 align:middle line:84%
When you have more
people with a self,

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:84%
you have more people that can
investigate by themselves,

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:84%
find the truth by themselves,
and not in a group,

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and become an
independent person.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And they can know
something about history

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.025 align:middle line:84%
so they don't fall into the
same tricks over and over again.

00:28:51.025 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which right
now is happening.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: So we're creating
good citizens, citizens

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:84%
that think like the Greeks
always talked about,

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.790 align:middle line:84%
the philosopher kings
and the people that

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:90%
voted in an ideal system.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.990 align:middle line:90%
We can recreate that.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:90%
We have to have hope.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
thing we have here.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist called it
a thin silvery strand

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:84%
which has-- like a thread
with amazing strength.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was reading
a little poem about hope

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:22.750 align:middle line:90%
recently that was just so sweet.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
It said, "hope has
holes in its pockets,"

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And you hold on to and
follow the crumbs of the path

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:90%
to an unknown destination.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.020 align:middle line:84%
You have to be comfortable
with the notion

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.360 align:middle line:90%
that the destination is unknown.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Like when I think of
my life, all the lucky things

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.610 align:middle line:90%
that happened to me.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the odds
were against it.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I always think of my
mother, because she

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:90%
prayed for us all the time.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.440 align:middle line:90%
She went to 5 o'clock mass.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And my father was an
alcoholic, and this church

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:90%
was her strength.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:90%
I love all the religions.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I have no problem
with any one of them.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I can see everything
that's there.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.280 align:middle line:84%
I can worship in every
church at every sacred site,

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's the place
that we have to get to.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Between now and then as
we're trying to get there,

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.970 align:middle line:84%
this time you must
be particularly,

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:84%
because you're so
sensitive and perceptive.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:84%
This period of history must
particularly affect you.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: It does.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.080 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.450 align:middle line:90%
But the hope is seen.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:90%
It's down on the list.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.728 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:30:34.728 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, it's been
nudged down a little bit.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:37.742 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:30:37.742 --> 00:30:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's right.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
realize that it's

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.380 align:middle line:84%
at their fingertips and that
their mental tips every day

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and every night, if you
shut this thing down.

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.128 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: This
programming machine.

00:30:51.128 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Because what the
establishment has done

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:59.000 align:middle line:84%
is put a little spy
and monitor inside you.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to drag you over
the coals out of guilt. You

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.040 align:middle line:90%
weren't good enough.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:84%
They graded you A, B, C's, D's,
and you weren't good at this.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:10.830 align:middle line:90%
You weren't good at that.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And so you're ripe for the
using and the manipulation.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
has probably never

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:84%
been more prevalent as today,
because by the age of one

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.932 align:middle line:84%
and two, children are holding
cell phones in their hands.

00:31:24.932 --> 00:31:26.515 align:middle line:84%
By the time they're
three, four, five,

00:31:26.515 --> 00:31:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and have big enough hands,
they're holding an iPad.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.240 align:middle line:84%
By the time they're in
school they're on computers.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And that goes-- extends all the
way through to octogenarians

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:84%
now on their Facebook pages,
being compared to others.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So our life has ended up in
this tiny little space about one

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:84%
to two feet in
front of us, and we

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:84%
have disconnected from
the Earth, from the sun,

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.320 align:middle line:90%
from the cosmos.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It's scary
where it's going.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:50.697 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is scary.

00:31:50.697 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And tell me where
you see it going

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.078 align:middle line:84%
and where some prophecies
say it could potentially go.

00:31:56.078 --> 00:31:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to look
at the other side of this.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Well, I always
go back to Thomas Edison,

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and he came up with a lot
of inventive technology.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And he had this hope
about technology.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:13.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, whatever it is,
whatever the mind can create

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.030 align:middle line:90%
has already been considered.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And the human character is
strong enough to handle it.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.490 align:middle line:90%
And so I live with that hope.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I live
with that hope too,

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.900 align:middle line:84%
but somehow, somewhere, we have
to put the devices down and go

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.220 align:middle line:84%
outside and look at the
sun and feel the grass

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.050 align:middle line:90%
and talk to the trees.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Because that's
where the intelligence is.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.840 align:middle line:84%
It is not-- because
as I explained,

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the last time I
think we were together,

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:46.630 align:middle line:90%
we don't run our own body.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.940 align:middle line:90%
It's automatic.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And who's doing it?

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Millions of bacteria,
plant, and animal that

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.310 align:middle line:84%
are conducting our
digestion and all

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:02.420 align:middle line:84%
of the areas of our
human body, and we still

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.920 align:middle line:84%
don't understand
what they're doing.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All the
automatic functioning.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.878 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It's all
coming from the plant.

00:33:06.878 --> 00:33:13.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why the green stone is at
the center, and the turquoise.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:84%
It's always at the center,
because the plant has the plan.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why the word
plan is in there.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we forget about--

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:26.410 align:middle line:84%
so much in spiritual development
over the last three to four

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.990 align:middle line:84%
decades has been about
rising up out of the body,

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
getting out of the
world of despair,

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and rising into
higher dimensions

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
when the fact is this body
is exquisite for helping

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.910 align:middle line:84%
us go through our transformation
of spiritual development.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:43.300 align:middle line:84%
It has all the
information encoded in it.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And the Mayan
people have a special gift.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:51.220 align:middle line:84%
The American Indian people
have a special gift of intimacy

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.100 align:middle line:84%
with that world,
that world of nature.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
inspired me, what

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:84%
got me going, because
I just started

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to teach about the Maya,
because I had Hispanic students

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.100 align:middle line:90%
and I became a teacher.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.100 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I just put in my application.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I had three credits
in education because I

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.120 align:middle line:84%
could speak some
Vietnamese and I could

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.550 align:middle line:90%
speak Japanese and Chinese.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.420 align:middle line:90%
They just hired me.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:17.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.237 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fair enough.

00:34:18.237 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So you became an educator, but
how did that lead you to then

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:24.292 align:middle line:90%
the Mayan culture?

00:34:24.292 --> 00:34:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Well,
because I started--

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.870 align:middle line:84%
because I realized that they
didn't know anything about it.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Their own

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.159 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Because the Europeans
were covering all that up,

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.270 align:middle line:90%
and I found it in our textbooks.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.290 align:middle line:84%
The first 10 or 15 pages were
about the American Indians

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.370 align:middle line:90%
and social studies.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Then Europe began.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:84%
So I worked most of my life
on multicultural history

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.469 align:middle line:90%
to get that wider.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And I did multicultural
events in the schools

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:52.750 align:middle line:90%
and in the community.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:55.435 align:middle line:84%
I became Multicultural
Teacher of the Year in Oregon.

00:34:55.435 --> 00:34:57.292 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:34:57.292 --> 00:34:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and people
can listen to you all day,

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:90%
because you're like--

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:08.380 align:middle line:84%
well, you're like a wonderful
druidic or Mayan sage.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Your knowledge base really
is coming from a meta level.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can apply
it to the micro,

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.080 align:middle line:84%
but it's really coming
from the meta level.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And what I like about
your work and what you do

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and the way you
think is that it's

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.620 align:middle line:90%
imbued with a type of grace.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And as you said earlier,
this whole place

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.270 align:middle line:84%
is created from love,
and we forget that.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:31.180 align:middle line:84%
We can't feel it a lot of
times these days because

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.823 align:middle line:84%
of the manipulation,
propagandization.

00:35:32.823 --> 00:35:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Because
we're surrounded

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:39.020 align:middle line:84%
by so much information, we just
have to have the will to stop.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And take time for
yourself, a walk in the forest,

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.120 align:middle line:90%
and do not talk to ourselves.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.057 align:middle line:84%
The American Indian does
not talk to themselves.

00:35:49.057 --> 00:35:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Living in the
moment and literally

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.600 align:middle line:90%
perceiving what you're amidst.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Because you're
getting messages all the time,

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.080 align:middle line:90%
but you don't know.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And the
messages can be

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:00.730 align:middle line:90%
interpreted in a certain way.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.270 align:middle line:84%
That's what watches
and clocks are for,

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:90%
because it's numerology.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's given to us by--
that's a sacred instrument.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Every watch-- I used
to use the cell phone,

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:16.000 align:middle line:84%
but I got so excited with a
flock of birds that I dropped

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:84%
the cell phone in
the toilet, so--

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.793 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Good for you.

00:36:18.793 --> 00:36:21.972 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] That's so Raymond.

00:36:21.972 --> 00:36:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so
I use a watch now.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:90%
I always wear a watch.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And numerology gives
you the ability

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:32.520 align:middle line:84%
to interpret what's going
on, because the birds,

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.780 align:middle line:84%
the trees have a
consciousness equal to ours.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Only we are taught by books
that say we have dominion

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and only human
beings have a soul,

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and we're programmed that the
rest of nature is nothing.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's an arrogance.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is an
incredible arrogance.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So-- because I want to ask about
EarthKeeper in a little bit.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:84%
But I want to get to the
place in the conversation,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.390 align:middle line:84%
the path of the red shaman
and the peace and justice

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:03.305 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world, the
final establishment of peace

00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and justice
throughout the world,

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.470 align:middle line:84%
because that's a message
we need to hear right now.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: OK.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:07.920 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I got it from Edgar
Cayce's readings.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:11.910 align:middle line:90%
A lot came through Edgar Cayce.

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Magical.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, work for your
highest ideal over and over.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:23.670 align:middle line:84%
For me, even that the odds
are 50 billion to one,

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.916 align:middle line:90%
have the gall--

00:37:25.916 --> 00:37:26.903 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tenacity.

00:37:26.903 --> 00:37:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: --have
the gall to hope.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Have the spritz in you to
hope for something better.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is the power
of the human being.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And we put that into
operation as a shaman,

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.670 align:middle line:84%
because we use our will to
respect the things of Earth.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I have here my crystal
skull with the stones that I

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.880 align:middle line:90%
picked up from everywhere.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Some of these stones are
my companion like obsidian.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Obsidian is a little
arrowhead that's been used.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not as sharp
as it usually is.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Obsidian is the sharpest
knife that can ever

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:11.430 align:middle line:90%
be made here on Earth so far.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Human beings cannot match it.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.500 align:middle line:90%
We cannot match it.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It is the
ancient knife of healing,

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.600 align:middle line:84%
so it's one of the earliest
companions of the shaman.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And so we use it to
heal when we have

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.890 align:middle line:90%
our mesa like this, our altar.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.510 align:middle line:90%
We do the ceremonies.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.500 align:middle line:90%
I bow.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.430 align:middle line:90%
You start in the east.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Then you go counterclockwise
and you go to the north.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.110 align:middle line:90%
And the north--

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I think obsidian wanted
me to talk about it.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.800 align:middle line:84%
The north is the white
place, clear stones

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.300 align:middle line:90%
and the white stones.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a
tough place to live,

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.950 align:middle line:84%
so you bow to the
north for perseverance.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Difficult to live up there.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And the atmosphere
is clearer up there.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.210 align:middle line:84%
So bow to the north
for clear sight.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.700 align:middle line:84%
This is the American Indian
way, just looking around.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Is this trying to
instruct us what to do?

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.650 align:middle line:90%
And they use their imagination.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's how the Maya did it.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they kept
moving to the west,

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and then they got
to the black stones.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians always buried
their dead on the west bank,

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:23.446 align:middle line:84%
because they conceived of
the world as it was turning

00:39:23.446 --> 00:39:26.360 align:middle line:90%
or the sun was going down.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we were going
with it, because we

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.430 align:middle line:90%
would be buried in the ground.

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:33.950 align:middle line:84%
The Earth would clean us,
and then we'd come up.

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the east was
when the sun came up again.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Because the
Earth cleans everything.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.880 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty about it.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:84%
We're finding that out with
medicines and herbs today,

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.350 align:middle line:90%
that it's unbelievable.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So going back to what
we talked about a moment ago

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:84%
about bringing in this
age of peace and justice

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and you were talking about
having the temerity to hope,

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.780 align:middle line:84%
having the courage
to hope in spite

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.330 align:middle line:84%
of what the external
world looks like, I think

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.270 align:middle line:84%
it's important for
everyone to remember

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.990 align:middle line:84%
it is our collective
individual that then feeds

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.602 align:middle line:84%
into the collective that's going
to determine the future path.

00:40:07.602 --> 00:40:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's right.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If we lose hope, we've
lost our potential of creation.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's the lifeline.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the lifeline.

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:16.840 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our potential
to create what we want.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And everything seems
to be beating down

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.810 align:middle line:84%
our minds to go into conformity
and lose hope right now.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:24.340 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: No.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And so what I
recommend to people

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.590 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes there's two
kinds of yoga as I see it.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.930 align:middle line:84%
There's the raja yoga,
which is done with the mind.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.950 align:middle line:90%
The mind is a tricky instrument.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a simpler way, and
it's called the bhakti yoga.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It's the service--

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.380 align:middle line:84%
My guru was a Jewish
fellow from New York.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And we had a commune
in Washington state,

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and all the swamis came through.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this
is bhakti yoga.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.510 align:middle line:90%
We chant.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Just chant the sacred name.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Whatever-- any
sacred name you've

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:06.890 align:middle line:84%
been taught that you
respect, just say it

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, and get
your mind out of the way.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is I face the
west where the sun is going down

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.150 align:middle line:90%
and the world is turning.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And just send the energy
maybe with the sun

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:29.580 align:middle line:84%
to come back up in
the east, and make

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.610 align:middle line:90%
magical things happen to you.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Allow for magic in your
world and watch it work.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of the magical
things that entered your life

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.192 align:middle line:84%
and has been with
you is EarthKeeper.

00:41:42.192 --> 00:41:42.992 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:41:42.992 --> 00:41:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the
great sacred skulls.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.940 align:middle line:90%
11.11.11, right?

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
you and EarthKeeper

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.610 align:middle line:90%
have been trotting the globe.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
EarthKeeper now

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and what he has also
been sharing with you.

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Everything changed
when I got a crystal skull.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.860 align:middle line:84%
I was playing around
with the calendar,

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.340 align:middle line:84%
because as a historian,
a researcher,

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what they
saw, what they felt,

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.220 align:middle line:90%
and what they heard.

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:17.757 align:middle line:84%
And I was just doing
it, practicing,

00:42:17.757 --> 00:42:19.840 align:middle line:84%
charging a little bit of
money, because you always

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.242 align:middle line:84%
should charge money
in your shamanship,

00:42:22.242 --> 00:42:23.950 align:middle line:84%
because they won't
respect you otherwise.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:25.870 align:middle line:90%
They have to make an offering.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:28.270 align:middle line:90%
The world is built on sacrifice.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And so then I-- this
skull, I was lecturing.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And they liked the lecture,
a man from Germany, a lady

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:90%
from Peru.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And they brought
EarthKeeper up to me.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.620 align:middle line:90%
He had his name already.

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.265 align:middle line:84%
And they said, he
wants to be with you.

00:42:45.265 --> 00:42:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Could you leave
him on the table?

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.940 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.320 align:middle line:90%
So I spoke the rest of the day.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't into crystal skulls.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're almost at
your 10-year anniversary,

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:55.010 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: But it
reminded me of, it

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:01.240 align:middle line:84%
made real the story of the
sacrifice of the Mayan Christ.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.110 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the skull.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is he bringing
as you travel around the world

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.970 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:08.350 align:middle line:90%
What is he bringing forward?

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: I explain
it first what

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.620 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Cayce said about crystal.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:15.270 align:middle line:84%
In the readings
of Edgar Cayce, he

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:19.560 align:middle line:84%
said crystal has two main
purposes upon the Earth.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.290 align:middle line:84%
The first and most
important is communication

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:90%
with other dimensions.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.630 align:middle line:84%
All shamans around the
world collect crystal.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Nostradamus to name
one famous one.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And the second one is
technology, memory.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Our whole computer industry
depends on crystal.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.620 align:middle line:84%
We would not have any
computer without the crystal.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:90%
And so that gave me the idea.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So I just did ceremonies,
the Mayan ceremony

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.820 align:middle line:90%
I just gave you part of.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And I just did the
ceremony with that.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And I used to have a format,
like when talking with you

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.110 align:middle line:90%
I have a format.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:00.885 align:middle line:84%
But with you, I
don't have a format.

00:44:00.885 --> 00:44:01.685 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:44:01.685 --> 00:44:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we go
unhinged right away.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.025 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And that's the way it
happens with the crystal skull.

00:44:08.025 --> 00:44:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How's he feeling
about things these days?

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Oh, hopeful.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Hopeful.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I need to tell you
about what's going on in the sky

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:16.840 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: I will.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We only have
a few minutes left,

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:20.515 align:middle line:90%
and this is important.

00:44:20.515 --> 00:44:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Oh my god.

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we've been
chatting for quite a while.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:23.410 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:24.580 align:middle line:90%
We're lost in time and space.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Oh, I have
so much to tell you.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Anyway--

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.073 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about the sky.

00:44:28.073 --> 00:44:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: I saw first
in 2017 the eclipse.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And I watched it carefully,
because happening like that,

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:42.800 align:middle line:84%
it's the eclipse that went over
the full scan of the United

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.270 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And this hasn't-- an eclipse
like this hasn't happened

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.250 align:middle line:90%
in 400 years.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the fractals
of the Maya, 20 times 20,

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.680 align:middle line:84%
because their number
system is based 20,

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.040 align:middle line:90%
not based 10 like ours.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:56.870 --> 00:45:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And the
moon is 400 times--

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:04.310 align:middle line:84%
the sun is 400 times further
from us than the moon,

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and the sun is 400 times
as wide as the moon is.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Exquisite.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The Maya
see all these things.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so it
started to come in.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that it came into
totality right across the US.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And it started its totality
right around Salem.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, Salem is the
name of the capitals

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:31.880 align:middle line:90%
that are named after Jerusalem.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:36.350 align:middle line:84%
The five-- the last five
letters of Jerusalem are Salem.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:40.490 align:middle line:84%
S-A-L-E-M. It means
peace also in Hebrew.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Shalom, city of peace.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.040 align:middle line:90%
And so interested, I noticed it.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And Portland is the more
blue side or a liberal side,

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:54.080 align:middle line:90%
and Salem is the more red side.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And it came sort of
right near Salem,

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and it went right
across 14 states.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Only one of them
was a blue state.

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:08.425 align:middle line:84%
And it went in an arc right
around to South Carolina.

00:46:08.425 --> 00:46:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
does this mean?

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.875 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It means their
power will be eclipsed.

00:46:12.875 --> 00:46:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their power
will be eclipsed.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:19.780 align:middle line:84%
The power-- the red mindset
or message will be eclipsed.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Because of the right-wing
religions in the place.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.850 align:middle line:84%
We're faced by a
triumvirate of them now.

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:34.670 align:middle line:84%
The Taliban, the
Hasidim in Palestine,

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:38.180 align:middle line:90%
and the evangelical religions.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And they consider
themselves more pure,

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.560 align:middle line:90%
and they get very radical.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of our trouble
is coming from there,

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.440 align:middle line:90%
from the book.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this will
be triumphed over,

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and that will go
toward justice--

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:50.945 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It's
sort of a showing.

00:46:50.945 --> 00:46:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A showing.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.403 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: I don't know what
the nature of an eclipse is,

00:46:54.403 --> 00:46:56.180 align:middle line:84%
but the eclipse
happened because all

00:46:56.180 --> 00:47:00.260 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden what they were
saying about the disease

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.460 align:middle line:90%
came back upon them.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.290 align:middle line:90%
The virus.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And the ones getting
the virus, they

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:07.700 align:middle line:84%
would say the cities
were getting it

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.380 align:middle line:90%
because they're sinful.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.630 align:middle line:84%
No, it turned out to
be the countryside.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain that.

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: In other
words, the red states

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.020 align:middle line:90%
were hit with the virus.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see
what you're saying.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:17.270 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:19.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The more rural areas.

00:47:19.495 --> 00:47:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: There was
an eclipse of sort.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're saying that
there will be an energy that

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:26.790 align:middle line:90%
will ride over that.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Ride over that.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And they will come
together, because the Bible

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.400 align:middle line:90%
is a beautiful book.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It's just they're interpreting
it, they're making it an idol.

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And in my studies from
the Bible itself--

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.750 align:middle line:90%
I read the Bible.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible itself, when Moses
came down and he found them

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:50.500 align:middle line:84%
worshiping a golden
calf, he said,

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.560 align:middle line:84%
you cannot worship
a graven image.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Anything carved or formed by
the hand of man is an idol.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Who made the images
and engraved them?

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:04.360 align:middle line:90%
Writing was always engraved.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.650 align:middle line:90%
It's graven in stone.

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:08.290 align:middle line:90%
It's the graven image.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:10.660 align:middle line:84%
They got rid of
everybody else's idols

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.620 align:middle line:84%
but kept the biggest
one for themselves.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.910 align:middle line:90%
So final words on that.

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: When I said
that to one man, he said--

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.327 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He didn't like it.

00:48:19.327 --> 00:48:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: He stared at
me for, like, 10 minutes.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say it now,
because you get to a point

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.850 align:middle line:84%
where you have to become
an independent shaman,

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and that's when you
master the baseball game.

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't agree more.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Just developing-- turning
to nature again, developing

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.520 align:middle line:84%
discernment to
care, having hope.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Having hope in a time that seems
to many hopeless I think is--

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:49.130 align:middle line:84%
you hit the nail on the
head-- maybe the most critical

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:49.930 align:middle line:90%
element.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Don't lose hope.

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:53.590 align:middle line:10%
>>TARPEY: And I want
to say to everyone,

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:57.440 align:middle line:10%
whoever listens to this, that
this is not my belief system.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.310 align:middle line:10%
This is what my research is.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:01.940 align:middle line:10%
I don't know anything.

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.580 align:middle line:10%
So all that I say, just
please consider it.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:05.380 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.588 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Raymond.

00:49:06.588 --> 00:49:08.410 align:middle line:84%
As always, well, we
ended up somewhere

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.270 align:middle line:84%
where we did talk about
peace and justice,

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:11.890 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know where
we were in between.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:12.670 align:middle line:90%
All over the place.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:13.522 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Holy mackerel.

00:49:13.522 --> 00:49:15.064 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]
It always happens.

00:49:15.064 --> 00:49:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Raymond, thank you.

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you so much for sharing

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.740 align:middle line:90%
your magic with us.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.240 align:middle line:10%
For more of these
conversations, you

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.620 align:middle line:10%
can go to the Gaia archives
for my previous interviews

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:25.420 align:middle line:10%
with Raymond.

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.510 align:middle line:10%
You can also go to his
website at raymondtarpey.com.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here
