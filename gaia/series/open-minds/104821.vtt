00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:31.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
In the early 1980s,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:10%
the phenomenon of
channeling began to emerge.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
In truth, the Bible and
other ancient documents

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.940 align:middle line:90%
are rife with this practice.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Today, the cosmic energies
are of a different nature,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and they're allowing us in our
whole solar system to open up,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and many more people
are opening up

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
to their deeper communications
with either their higher

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:90%
self or other beings.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Today, you'll meet
Lee Harris, who

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:84%
has brought through some
really interesting and wise

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:84%
information over
the last decade.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Lee, I'm glad
you're here with us.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And I met you,
actually, when we were

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:84%
working with Sheila
Gillette and the Theo Group.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE HARRIS: That's true, yeah.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I saw your
books, and I thought, hey,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
let's just continue
the theme a bit.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm always
fascinated with what

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.094 align:middle line:84%
I consider to be really kind
of clean channeled works.

00:01:16.094 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And so first of all,
this isn't what you

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:90%
intended to do with your life.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.161 align:middle line:90%
I love your purple, by the way.

00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:84%
This isn't what you intended
to do with your life.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, at at all.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.711 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And usually it isn't.

00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It kind of knocks
people on the head.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, not at all.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I was very much-- I
tried a couple of paths.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I had my dreams
to work in music.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:10%
I'd spent a lot of
time in theater.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I went on my own
path of self-development.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And the channeling happened
privately for me during that.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:90%
It was like a light bulb moment.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
It was literally,
one day it was there.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But I never at
that point thought

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.070 align:middle line:84%
it would be something I
would be comfortable doing.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, it wasn't
when I first started doing it.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But that was something
I had to overcome.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's interesting.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:84%
As I was reading
in your book, it

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:84%
was as though you started
hearing voices in your head.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
necessarily your own.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, this happens
to a lot of people.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:84%
They think, where
did that come from?

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:84%
But most people will just
simply brush it aside

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh well, that was
random, and just ignore it.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.179 align:middle line:84%
What made you not ignore it
when that started happening?

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because
it was too helpful,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.730 align:middle line:90%
and that wasn't my own voices.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So the way I've talked about
it, I was 23 at the time,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and I had a lot of
my own self-attack

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:90%
and my own self-judgment.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So this voice was
completely different.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So my thoughts would tend to
be fairly inward or downward

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.746 align:middle line:90%
on myself.

00:02:37.746 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And then all of
a sudden, one day

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I was on the
Underground in London,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and I just heard this
very clear voice.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And the clear voice was then
accessible from that day

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.450 align:middle line:90%
to this day.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:90%
And I asked lots of questions.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.427 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
are you my guides?

00:02:52.427 --> 00:02:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, yes, we
are essentially your guides.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And as the years
have gone on, I've

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:84%
had a different
understanding and a kind

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:90%
of wider understanding of it.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, that
was what I understood,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I'd accessed my higher self,
which I don't think I really--

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:90%
it felt too easy.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.455 align:middle line:84%
So you know when you read the
book, how to access your higher

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.954 align:middle line:84%
self, you think, well, this
must be some big mystical thing.

00:03:11.954 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't understand
how it had clicked.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But what I've since
come to understand,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and they've said this to me,
is that you were hearing us

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, but
you couldn't make

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:90%
clear, auditory connection.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And then there came a
day when I was ready to.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I just did a
lot of personal study.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And through that, the words
and the advice they were giving

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
was so validating and expanding
to my own life, I was like, OK,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.161 align:middle line:84%
well even if this is some kind
of madness, it's really useful.

00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.868 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there you do.

00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:90%
The quality was there.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, definitely.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.006 align:middle line:84%
And then working
with other people

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
was a second step,
because for other people

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:90%
to have the same impact from it.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So it was a combination of
verifying it for my own life

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and very clearly seeing
that other people were

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:90%
impacted and opened by it.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Those were the two things that
gave me the confidence to trust

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:90%
what was happening.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead of
being just embarrassed.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: That was the key.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.230 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say,
were you not nervous?

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing I was nervous
about was public perception.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Nothing-- in
myself, it was just natural.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
It was, oh, like it's
always been here.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you were
afraid of being laughed at.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Afraid of
judgment and stigma

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and the obvious thing,
which is, oh, well they're

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:90%
making that up.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think for
me what was funny

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:84%
was when I was in theater, I
was known as a good character

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:90%
actor.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.867 align:middle line:90%
So I could transform.

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So my rationale was always,
listen, if I was channeling,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd have come up with
a way better accent.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to fake
it, I hope I would

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.090 align:middle line:90%
have done it in a better way.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you'd
be conscious of it.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.580 align:middle line:84%
You'd be aware of the fact
that you were faking it.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, of course.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.888 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There would
be this disconnect.

00:04:41.888 --> 00:04:43.982 align:middle line:84%
And you said you
came to understand it

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:84%
over time in a
little different way

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
than your first understanding
that, oh, this is my guide.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:90%
What did you come to understand?

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, the
more I channeled

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and the more I
have-- essentially,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.017 align:middle line:84%
I guess the more your own
ego starts to dissolve

00:04:57.017 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and you start to feel more
connected to everything

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and you see that actually
the universe is endless,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and more questions just
create more questions.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.994 align:middle line:84%
Initially, the answers
solve perhaps the emotions

00:05:07.994 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:84%
that you're struggling with
or the limited thinking,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:90%
and you open.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But as you keep opening, I
find that everything just

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:90%
gets wider.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
they always said

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.730 align:middle line:84%
was that you would
understand us this way.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.350 align:middle line:84%
We're 12 or 13 guides that are
working very directly with you,

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:84%
but we come from a
collective of 88.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:84%
But then that 88 extends
wider into source.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't really interested in
the extends wider into source

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
for about six or seven
years, because it

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:84%
was a big enough deal to kind
of have this level of contact.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So now I always find a
definition harder to qualify.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.819 align:middle line:84%
So even if someone asks me
about being a channel, well,

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:90%
what is that?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
They tend to have a very
defined view of what it is.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
more you open up,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
the more you realize,
well, this is just

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:84%
some massive kaleidoscope
of communication, energy,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:90%
and growth.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And depending on what point we
are at in that kaleidoscope,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:84%
we can access over
here or over here.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I guess, as the
door broke open into a wider

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
universe through
channeling, I suddenly

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.130 align:middle line:84%
realized how big it was
and how small I was,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
rather than feeling
all fancy about it.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I think actually
it's a great gift

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:84%
to kind of help you let
go of a lot of those ideas

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:84%
that you might have had before,
like ideas I might have had

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:84%
about enlightenment and
what that looked like, I now

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.554 align:middle line:84%
realize enlightenment is
completely non-describable

00:06:33.554 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's
completely individual

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:90%
for every individual.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.084 align:middle line:84%
And so things that I
needed to move beyond,

00:06:40.084 --> 00:06:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I guess, that they
helped me with.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you talk about it,

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:84%
the further you go,
the more questions you

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
ask, the wider the scope,
the wider the questions.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So I would assume that you're
talking about a wider field

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:90%
of possibility in all ways.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Possibility, and
also, I was someone who as a kid

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:84%
had this real affinity with
movies about UFOs and aliens

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.067 align:middle line:84%
but didn't really look
beyond that, in the same way

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
that I had the affinity
with the movie "Star Wars"

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:84%
but didn't really get it
was because of the Force.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And then as an adult and
the more I'm channeling

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and the more I'm learning
about this universal life that

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.550 align:middle line:84%
is out there-- and
not just out there,

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
very much here as
well-- that started

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:90%
to blow my mind a little bit.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And again, it can be
a separating factor

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:84%
with other people if
you choose to let it

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:84%
or if you're able to
integrate it and go, OK,

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.594 align:middle line:84%
I know what I have experienced
to be true in the universe,

00:07:28.594 --> 00:07:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't mean I can't
connect with this person who

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.499 align:middle line:90%
may have a different fixed idea.

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
That was the part that kind
of blew apart for me a bit,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:84%
too, kind of what
I thought Earth was

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and what I thought
humanity was and what

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:90%
I thought our growth path was.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly I was like, oh,
wow, this is so much bigger

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:90%
than I ever conceived.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:90%
And again, I'm this small in it.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's fascinating.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
have been people

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that watch you go into the
state who also see energy and so

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.562 align:middle line:84%
forth who talk about
this when you start going

00:07:56.562 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:84%
into your channeling
process, which we'll

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:90%
do a little later in the show.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
They see this swirling
field of color

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.747 align:middle line:84%
enveloping you at the time you
start making that connection.

00:08:07.747 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And it
feels very different.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the
reasons when I was here

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:84%
with Sheila, the reason I
asked the question about her

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
is I notice with
myself when channeling,

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:84%
the electrical energy
field around your body just

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:21.712 align:middle line:90%
really amplifies.

00:08:21.712 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's something you have
to be careful and mindful

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.826 align:middle line:84%
of as well, particularly if
you're channeling for groups.

00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So that was why I
was interested to see

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:84%
what Theo's perspective
for her was, because it's

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:90%
a question I look at a lot.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that
electrical energy field

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:90%
is the undeniable state change.

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting to me to be
able to have that experience,

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.725 align:middle line:84%
to feel the body get hotter
and to come out of it

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:90%
and know that you feel altered.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And for me, kind
of just going back

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
a little bit to your
question, I think,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is I think sometimes
what I would struggle

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
with was that people would focus
on the channeling as separate

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:90%
from them.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I first started working
as a more public channeler

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:84%
in 2006, I didn't
really know anything

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:90%
about the channeling field.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed how
many people were

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:84%
making perceptions
about channelers,

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and channeling that was
really limiting them.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
taking this idea

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.684 align:middle line:84%
that this special
thing was happening

00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:90%
and actually to mean--

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
weren't part of it.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.049 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And the prevalence
of exactly what you said.

00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:84%
I think the growth of
channeling from-- it's

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
been here all the
time, but you look

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
at the more modern channelers,
Jane Roberts who paved the way,

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and I think the hundredth
monkey principle is at work.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And so if you are around
people who channel,

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:84%
already you're into the
field of the possibility

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
of you being able to
access that for yourself.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.819 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's the point,
more than the information, more

00:09:43.819 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
than anything else, the point
is the energy of opening.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We each have this in
ourselves if we were choosing.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Some people have been
able to gain that

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:84%
through following the threads,
a little practice here,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.110 align:middle line:84%
a knock on the door
there, and an experience,

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.034 align:middle line:90%
and a realization.

00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And you just kind
of bumble along,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and over the years--
boom-- you're connected.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.043 align:middle line:90%
Other people are like you.

00:10:04.043 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.435 align:middle line:84%
It happens rather
quickly and for purpose.

00:10:07.435 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I guess
I should qualify.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.924 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a lot of
self-development work,

00:10:10.924 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't specifically
wanting to be a channeler.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that I understand.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I
should qualify I was

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.567 align:middle line:84%
kind of looking
into certain things,

00:10:17.567 --> 00:10:19.900 align:middle line:84%
but I never thought that would
happen to me in that way.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And when people
come to you, we're

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:84%
a funny lot, human
beings, in that

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
because we're living
in these little glass

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:84%
cages of perception, it's
the same kind of themes

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.800 align:middle line:84%
that come over and over again
when people ask questions.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter how much
knowledge a person may have.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.974 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the people that are
joining us today, our audience,

00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:84%
these are people that
have a lot of knowledge.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.300 align:middle line:84%
These are people that have been
looking, highly perceptive,

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:90%
intelligent, in most cases.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And yet, like when Sheila was
here, when it comes down to it,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:84%
it's the simplest
things that dog us.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that it's
dogging us because of, again,

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:84%
this glass cage of
sorts that we either

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:84%
have allowed
ourselves to go into,

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
it's been perpetuated
or thrust upon us.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And really, a lot
of your channelings

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:90%
are breaking those perceptions.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, thank you.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I've only years later been able
to see what that's to do with.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And there was a channel I
did called the Crystalline

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Body in 2012.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.446 align:middle line:84%
And they talked about
the energy grids

00:11:28.446 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with
on Earth that hold us

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:90%
in limitation and in fear.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And they spoke
quite specifically

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:84%
about some of the shadow
aspects of government

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:90%
behind the curtain and--

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As does
the Theo Group,

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.020 align:middle line:84%
especially privately
when I've asked them.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.163 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It exists.

00:11:41.163 --> 00:11:42.675 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we're
making this up.

00:11:42.675 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Not at all.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.133 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are
agendas, and there

00:11:45.133 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:84%
are beings of a more
controlling nature

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.590 align:middle line:84%
that would like to see us
stay in our little glass cages

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.460 align:middle line:90%
or prisons.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.376 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And that's a
good way of putting it,

00:11:53.376 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:84%
the glass cage that we all were
born into and encouraged into.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
where it comes from,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:84%
because if you think about
the chakra system in our body,

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
we can open our third
eye, but if we haven't yet

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
cleared out our emotional
energy field here,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much
we open our third eye

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:84%
or our universal mind, the
knowledge will kind of linger

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:84%
up here, and it will slowly
drip-feed into the body,

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and it will start
to open something,

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:84%
but then there's going to come a
point when you at age 16 or you

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
at age 25 or you
at age 33 or you

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
aged in the 15th century,
past lives, pops open.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Because what I've
come to understand

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:84%
is I think often in the
spiritual search for people,

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
there is an idea
of wanting more.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
can become escape.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't want
to be here on the planet,

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:84%
which I think all of us can
relate to at some point,

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
particularly when you see the
darkness and the suffering that

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:90%
goes on.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But the whole point that the Z's
are always talking to me about

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:90%
is, that's your job.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So once you have opened to the
energy of wide consciousness,

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.235 align:middle line:84%
now what you are doing is
you are in the generation

00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:84%
that, like the generation before
you and like the generation

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:84%
after us, our job
is to try and bring

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.235 align:middle line:84%
more of that down
into these bodies

00:13:10.235 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and clear out the density
of the ancestral patterns.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
that's interesting.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the dichotomy
here is when

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:84%
you are able to open up into
this more ephemeral world,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
by its very nature, it is
not anything that stays.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:84%
It is literally just born
and goes in the moment.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the part
you're talking about

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.790 align:middle line:90%
is actually a very dense part.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.222 align:middle line:90%
You could say part of the field.

00:13:36.222 --> 00:13:37.930 align:middle line:84%
You can say it's part
of the auric field.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:84%
It's its own subtle
body, whatever.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.820 align:middle line:84%
The subtle body of emotion is
incredibly powerful, gripping,

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:90%
and dense.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to
take all this ephemeral,

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.290 align:middle line:84%
conceptual information
and think that you

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:90%
can manage this partnership.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And so they talked
quite a bit about being

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.475 align:middle line:84%
stuck into these emotional
patterns of fear.

00:13:58.475 --> 00:14:00.872 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes, and I think
it's actually helpful,

00:14:00.872 --> 00:14:03.330 align:middle line:84%
because I've met many people
who were torturing themselves,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:84%
because they were like,
I know all this, and why?

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I started.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:84%
After about three years of
being a pretty dedicated

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
public channeler and creating
a lot of the work that's

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:84%
in the books, I'd
already at that point

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:84%
begun to develop my own
intuitive nature with people.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, I can
see there's a gap here,

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people are
being inspired by channels.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:27.096 align:middle line:90%
They feel lit up.

00:14:27.096 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:90%
They float out for a while.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:90%
They open.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
back to their life,

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and they don't know
how to apply it.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you're still dealing--

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:84%
you're in the
grips of these kind

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.070 align:middle line:84%
of old emotional subconscious
patterns that are very real.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.612 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And the Z's always
say that the body is slow,

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:42.070 align:middle line:84%
which I know it annoys some
people, because some people go,

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.403 align:middle line:90%
you can heal anything overnight.

00:14:43.403 --> 00:14:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I get that
that's a possibility,

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.090 align:middle line:84%
but when the group of us are
not holding that in our fields,

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:84%
either through
practice or belief,

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:84%
we already have two hold-backs
to that being a possibility.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So we see that the
people who can levitate,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
they're often on their own,
way away from everyone else.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, that
makes total sense to me.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, yeah, of
course [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.788 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we do have
these random little miracles

00:15:05.788 --> 00:15:08.444 align:middle line:84%
that do happen where somebody
does have an instant healing.

00:15:08.444 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We've experienced these
things, and you think, well,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.651 align:middle line:90%
where did that come from?

00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't care-- thank you.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And hopefully
that will increase.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.064 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
will increase.

00:15:16.064 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But for now, because of
this collective agreement

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:84%
about time, even, how long
does it take for something

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.540 align:middle line:90%
to heal ordinarily?

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle line:84%
You read online, you
go to a medical site.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:90%
It takes this long to heal.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:84%
These very things,
just during that kind

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
of on-the-grounds
research, so to speak,

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.185 align:middle line:84%
is inhibiting the ability of
ourselves to affect matter.

00:15:39.185 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's interesting.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:84%
You saying that prompts me
to a memory, which was-- you

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
know toenail fungus which
can happen for people?

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I had that on my big toe about--
I don't know-- six years ago.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.109 align:middle line:84%
And I went to my natural
medicine doctor, and for a year

00:15:54.109 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I was putting these oils on
and all that kind of stuff.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And just nothing was moving.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't getting worse,
but nothing was moving.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.592 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke to the
Z's, and they said,

00:16:01.592 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
well, this comes from
your father's side,

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and his belief system
is not natural medicine.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So you would do better
to go to the doctor

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and get the drugs,
which I'm very--

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.957 align:middle line:90%
loath to do unless I have to.

00:16:12.957 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And they were right.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But somehow there
was a passed-on pattern

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.578 align:middle line:84%
in your matrix from your
father-- subconscious.

00:16:17.578 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Exactly, so I
took these drugs for three,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.540 align:middle line:90%
four months.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:90%
And then it was gone forever.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.444 align:middle line:84%
So it was a good lesson for
me, particularly working

00:16:25.444 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:84%
in a field where
people will often

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.620 align:middle line:84%
be very pro-- the only
solution is the natural way.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I think, like
everybody's healing,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:90%
is all case-by-case basis.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's all each moment.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
explaining was,

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
if the density of
what needs healing

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
matches the density of the
drug, then you take the drug.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.390 align:middle line:90%
It was very good for me.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not, it's
very common sense.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.775 align:middle line:84%
I had a little
experience the other day

00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
that's the opposite of
what we're talking about.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
It was this that goes into
the realm of instant healing.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I was moving, kind of fell off
the back of the moving truck,

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
jammed my heel at a
torque on the ground.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And so it's two days later.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting ready
to fly back here

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:90%
now after it really kicked in.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't walk.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It hurt.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like someone with
an ice pick on my lower spine.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh my
God, I can't go to work.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.609 align:middle line:84%
I have eight interviews
to do this week.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what to do.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I felt the
funny tingling on my head.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, let's
just see what's up.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Laid down to take a little
half-hour meditation,

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.310 align:middle line:84%
initially, which turned
very quickly to a nap.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Once I feel the tingling, I
know something's going on.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Woke up, and oh,
that was refreshing.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Careful, careful, get up.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:90%
And-- boom-- there was nothing.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't even a
signature that there

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:90%
had been any kind of injury.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.382 align:middle line:90%
Done.

00:17:41.382 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Got on the plane.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Here I am. [LAUGHS] And
I thought, thank you.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just saying that
because these things

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:90%
can happen and do happen.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They can.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:51.549 align:middle line:90%
They can.

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have no mindset
against it happening.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, no I've
had similar experiences,

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and I hear that from
other people too, so yeah.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just
saying, if we can

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
go into relationship
with ourselves

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:84%
or our beings, our guides,
healers, and universal healers,

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle line:90%
they can do these things for us.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Absolutely.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's two
reflections of the same thing.

00:18:11.785 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:90%
No, it's great.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then another
thing I was reading about,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:90%
the notion of abundance.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
You write about that
in-- I think it's

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Book One toward the beginning.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Because it comes up again in
Book Two-- This dogs people.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
How come so-and-so
has all this stuff?

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I even pay my rent?

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And they really looked at it
from a very-- first of all,

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:84%
tell us who the Z's are,
who the three Z's are.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And then tell us why they
address this fairly commonly

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:90%
and their view of it as well.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So the three Z's--
well, the Z's are a collective.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.335 align:middle line:84%
And Zachary was given to me as
rather humorously as the name,

00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
because he said, well,
we'll give you a name,

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.210 align:middle line:90%
but we don't have names.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But we know that you humans need
names, so we'll give you one.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.500 align:middle line:90%
And Zachary is the closest.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2007,
so at that point

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd been channeling
for almost a decade,

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.700 align:middle line:90%
but I was public at the time.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.667 align:middle line:84%
Ziadora and Zapharia, who
were the two female energies,

00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:84%
came through from
the same collective.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So that was interesting that
that happened and little

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:84%
challenging for me, but I also
got why it needed to happen.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Now they've kind of
homogenized again.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the interview
at the end of Book Two,

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Marty interviewed them.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.210 align:middle line:84%
They said yes, the reason we
did it at that period was it

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:84%
was useful to focus
male-feminine balance.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.837 align:middle line:84%
And now it's important
to focus on unity,

00:19:27.837 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:84%
so we've just kind of
blended back together again.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
is the name now?

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.299 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I
call them the Z's.

00:19:33.299 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just Z's.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Now it's all the Z's.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The Z's because they
were the names that were given.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.501 align:middle line:84%
And the kind of best
answer that I ever

00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:84%
heard them give
about who they were,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was to Sandie
Sedgbeer in an interview,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:84%
they said, we are a
voice of galactic source.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I once said to
them, are you alien?

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:90%
What are you?

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Because people always want
to know, is this an angel?

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Is this a--?

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we're
travelers, but we're

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:90%
a voice of galactic source.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And they explained
that they, unlike, say,

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.670 align:middle line:84%
when people are channeling a
dharmist or an Earth Angel,

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:84%
they're a little more
associated with Earth.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.473 align:middle line:84%
The Z's kind of sit
somewhere in the middle,

00:20:11.473 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and they have a strong
relationship with Earth.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And also two of them have been
incarnate before several times.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But they said, we
are really universal.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:90%
So we are a bridge.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.686 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of their field.

00:20:25.686 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Abundance was interesting
because at the time

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:84%
that channel happened,
"The Secret" had just kind

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.341 align:middle line:90%
of exploded.

00:20:31.341 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:90%
So that was really exploring--

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was
backlash from that.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people were
saying, I did that.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:90%
I made my vision board.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:90%
How come it's not happening?

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I know.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.338 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I kind of
liked the Abundance channel.

00:20:40.338 --> 00:20:42.585 align:middle line:84%
Because what I
felt it focused me

00:20:42.585 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
on when I heard it
back was gratitude.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.950 align:middle line:84%
More than anything, it was
actually the power of gratitude

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:90%
beyond all.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Where that resonated with me
was this idea, particularly

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:84%
in Western culture,
where you forget

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
about what's going on in
other parts of the world.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.826 align:middle line:84%
It's like someone wants
the latest iPhone,

00:21:01.826 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and in another
part of the world,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:84%
someone wants to eat
or get drinking water.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're really looking
at abundance from a spiritual,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe from a
holistic, spiritual set,

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at the abundance
of ease that our lives have.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And then within that,
unpick where we are not

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.750 align:middle line:84%
feeling we are at
ease or in flow,

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:84%
either because of the
contracts we have running

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.517 align:middle line:84%
with our jobs and our people,
or the contract we have

00:21:26.517 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:84%
running with our own
perception of abundance

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.666 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and they
put it in a way-- they

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:34.165 align:middle line:84%
said from our
perspective, abundance

00:21:34.165 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:90%
is something entirely different.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:42.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a freedom of expression,
a freedom of-- there

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.267 align:middle line:90%
was another word there.

00:21:43.267 --> 00:21:45.350 align:middle line:84%
You can supply it for me
rather than me saying it.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
But essentially,
it's the freedom

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
to be able to fully live,
fully engage, and fully

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:90%
express yourself in your life.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.260 align:middle line:84%
From their perspective,
that's abundance.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.426 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I love how
we're seeing lots of people

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:84%
in the corporate world
now going off and doing

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:90%
these very abundant things.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not-- again,
some people are

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.748 align:middle line:84%
meant to be in the corporate
world and changing that,

00:22:04.748 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:90%
and that's beautiful.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But I think our society is now
beginning to break down perhaps

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:84%
what in the '80s we were taught
to focus on as abundance, which

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:90%
was success, money, status.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Those things actually
were attained by people,

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and then they were like,
uh, I'm still not happy.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.740 align:middle line:90%
So what's happiness?

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is purpose
and flow and being

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.732 align:middle line:84%
able to be alive and be
grateful to be alive.

00:22:24.732 --> 00:22:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
they were saying

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:31.789 align:middle line:84%
that to try to continue chasing
after the old paradigm of what

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:84%
abundance was considered
to be, which was totally

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.480 align:middle line:84%
materialistic, is
actually robbing yourself

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:84%
of any genuine
abundance in life,

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.990 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
dysfunction and pain that

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.767 align:middle line:84%
has come along with that
to serve that master.

00:22:44.767 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's true.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And you see that a lot,
not with everybody,

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:84%
but with many people who are
chasing large amounts of money

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:90%
or large status.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.870 align:middle line:84%
You feel often when
you meet those people,

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:84%
unless they are really
just living their purpose

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
in the center of it,
there is something

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.417 align:middle line:84%
that you can feel
is missing for them.

00:23:03.417 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's quite apparent.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying to fill
an empty hole of some kind.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, yeah,
and I can imagine

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.390 align:middle line:90%
that's quite a sad arrival.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
If you've thought that
this and this and this

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:84%
were going to be the
things that made you happy,

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and you get there and then
you don't know where to turn.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course, then you turn
to spirit, most people do,

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.310 align:middle line:84%
some kind of awakening
whether it's--

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Better than
drugs and alcohol.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, that's true.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Better for the body.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as an extension
of that conversation,

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
they also talked about
the energy of competition.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And now this is a really
huge paradigm shift,

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.970 align:middle line:84%
the notion of moving away
from competition in general.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And can you share
some of what they

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:84%
said about the nature
of competition,

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:41.947 align:middle line:90%
what it does to us?

00:23:41.947 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes, it's interesting.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:84%
The day before doing that
channel, we were in New York

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:90%
to do that seminar.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And I got really sick,
just sick in my stomach,

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:90%
not physically sick.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
lot flying around

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:90%
at the time about the economy.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.452 align:middle line:84%
And so being in New York
at that time was very--

00:23:58.452 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very intense.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I was walking
around really feeling it.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And the energy of competition
was really an invitation

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
to see our own shadow judgments
and our complete misperceptions

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.949 align:middle line:84%
on when we are envious
of what someone else has.

00:24:11.949 --> 00:24:13.490 align:middle line:84%
We are never seeing
the full picture,

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:90%
and yet we think we are.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.682 align:middle line:84%
So you might say, well,
I wish I was Regina,

00:24:17.682 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:84%
because she's moving house,
and whereas your story is

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:84%
you're falling off
the back of the truck

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.800 align:middle line:90%
and hurting your foot.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right. [LAUGHS]

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.996 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And who
knows what else you're

00:24:23.996 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:90%
kind of balancing in your life.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So the energy of
competition was a reminder

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.735 align:middle line:84%
of how shortsighted envy
of another actually is

00:24:31.735 --> 00:24:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and to invite
yourself to see that.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Because also, if you're
competing with somebody

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:84%
or trying to win,
and you want them

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.344 align:middle line:84%
to lose in order
to facilitate that,

00:24:41.344 --> 00:24:42.760 align:middle line:84%
you're all going
to lose together.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you
look at how-- I

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.510 align:middle line:84%
think a lot of the messages
in the last five years

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.470 align:middle line:84%
particularly have gone more
towards the idea of oneness.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
experiencing that now.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a higher level of
intuitive telepathy going on

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:56.630 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So we are beginning
to understand

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.460 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have to
fight each other to get

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:90%
the piece of the pie.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.100 align:middle line:84%
We can work together and
trust that we will all

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:84%
eat at the right time because
we're working together.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we're
stronger and richer anyway.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
and as you're saying,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:90%
comparison is the key.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Comparison is
really at the heart.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And it happens in such
subtle ways, moment

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:84%
by moment in life, where
someone says something--

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:90%
it gets your hackles up.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, I know that.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And you feel a need to have
to speak up or defend yourself

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:90%
on some level.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:90%
This is all part of competition.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the subtle
subconscious process

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
of comparison we've
been going through for

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.970 align:middle line:84%
many, many thousands
of years as a species.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:47.325 align:middle line:84%
This is a hard one to root
out because it's subtle.

00:25:47.325 --> 00:25:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It is a hard one.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And I also think this is
one of those ones that

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:90%
collides with self-judgment.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
things I'm constantly

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.270 align:middle line:84%
talking to people about is try
and let go of self-judgment

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:90%
if nothing else.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Because if you start to
let go of self-judgment,

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
then that means when you have to
face something inside yourself

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:84%
that comes up, you will
be the observer of it,

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and you will bring
awareness to it.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And with awareness
will come change.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you judge what you
see as your own inner shadow,

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
being competitive towards
someone else or having a-- then

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:84%
you immediately
contract back again,

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and the shadow has to rise.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And I had a personal
experience about a year

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:84%
after writing "The
Energy of Competition."

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I think at the time, I was
working full time in this work,

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:90%
but it was tough.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I remember you're trying to
keep what you're doing going,

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to make ends meet.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember seeing a
contemporary-- I can't remember

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.110 align:middle line:84%
what they did, but they
had this big kind of boom,

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.930 align:middle line:90%
and I remember noticing envy.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't unhappy for them,
but I remember going, oh, I

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
wish that was happening
for me, because then that

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.530 align:middle line:90%
would take away this.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
comparing yourself,

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:90%
like you were less than.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Completely.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.371 align:middle line:90%
I remembered the channel.

00:26:51.371 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:90%
I caught it.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It took me about three days
back then to work through it.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew I had to hold it
there and let it just burn off

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and really remind
myself, you don't

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:84%
know what's going
on in their life,

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:08.246 align:middle line:84%
so don't assume that
you want their reality.

00:27:08.246 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if you were supposed
to have their reality,

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:90%
you would have it.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.219 align:middle line:84%
So often that can happen
for me about sometime

00:27:14.219 --> 00:27:15.010 align:middle line:90%
after the channels.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
But I've learned to not judge
these parts of ourselves,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.780 align:middle line:90%
because they're not just us.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.310 align:middle line:84%
I think particularly
sensitive people

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.847 align:middle line:90%
can very much internalize.

00:27:25.847 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And especially if you were the
person who walked into the room

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.263 align:middle line:84%
when everyone was
unhappy, and you were just

00:27:30.263 --> 00:27:34.650 align:middle line:84%
trying to lift people, either
by being bright or compensating,

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:37.920 align:middle line:84%
you always put yourself last,
and you served everyone else.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, you
might have got over

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
that at some point
in your journey,

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.370 align:middle line:84%
but what did it leave at the
edge of your energy field?

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, it would have left their
unhappiness, their grief,

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:84%
their depression,
their judgment.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think one of
the great gifts

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:55.180 align:middle line:84%
for me was understanding that
we are this ocean of energy,

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes it's not just you.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.975 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you've been
around very negative people

00:27:58.975 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:90%
for a few days.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our fields are
overlapping all the time.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.734 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Completely.

00:28:01.734 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Completely.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.182 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about our
houses with these walls,

00:28:05.182 --> 00:28:07.640 align:middle line:84%
often they're really thin, so
we perceive we're on our own,

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.887 align:middle line:84%
but you can feel what's going
on through the wall next door

00:28:10.887 --> 00:28:11.845 align:middle line:90%
even if you don't know.

00:28:11.845 --> 00:28:12.428 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:12.428 --> 00:28:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're jogging my memory.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.220 align:middle line:84%
There was another
intriguing little bit

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.630 align:middle line:84%
in there about the
blending of energy fields

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and sleeping with other
people in the same bed

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.269 align:middle line:90%
with another human being.

00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that for a moment?

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Because people are,
I'm not moving out.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:90%
My husband and I sleep together.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
implication of what's

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:90%
going on at night.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.096 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's
interesting you say that.

00:28:35.096 --> 00:28:37.572 align:middle line:10%
I was just reminded
yesterday-- two friends of mine

00:28:37.572 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:10%
who are a very spiritual
couple, they now

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:10%
sleep in separate bedrooms.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.970 align:middle line:10%
And it's beautiful between them.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:84%
They said, occasionally
we'll sleep together,

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.474 align:middle line:84%
but we sleep better, and that's
just where they're at right now

00:28:46.474 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:90%
in their journey.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so what was explained
was when we sleep,

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.950 align:middle line:84%
it's a little like
everything inside us

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:90%
and around us can open.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And imagine just
a very big bubble

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:90%
around your sleeping body.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fusion of what
you've gone through that day

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and what you're going
through in your life

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and what your higher
consciousness can feel

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.950 align:middle line:90%
is coming in for you.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:90%
And so things can burn off.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So a bad dream is often
just a manifestation

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.970 align:middle line:84%
where your minds needs to focus
something to shift your energy.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
memory of a bad dream,

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:84%
but actually what
was happening was

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:20.851 align:middle line:84%
you were getting over a
fear that you then didn't

00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:22.070 align:middle line:90%
have to play out in your day.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So often people have a
funny idea about the dreams.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, what was said about
sleeping with people, which

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:84%
you had a smile of
acknowledgement,

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.845 align:middle line:84%
and I can completely
relate to it,

00:29:31.845 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:84%
too, depending on who
you're sleeping next to,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
completely affected by what's

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:90%
going on for them.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your bubbles
are overlapping.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:39.805 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:29:39.805 --> 00:29:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of a couple
who one or both of them

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:84%
are stressed and they're
having a stressful time,

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.755 align:middle line:84%
it might be a really
great exercise to go, hey,

00:29:47.755 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:84%
why don't we just sleep in
different rooms tonight?

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Because we're both a bit
fried, or one partner's

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.052 align:middle line:90%
more fried than the other.

00:29:54.052 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there are different--

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And see if you
can clear it on your own

00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:90%
and become stable.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Definitely.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.080 align:middle line:90%
And I often think about this.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.810 align:middle line:84%
They've spoken a little bit
about sex and lovemaking

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.112 align:middle line:84%
and how that's also
a complete infusion

00:30:07.112 --> 00:30:09.570 align:middle line:84%
of the energy with the other
person, which is why I think--

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People need to be
a little careful about who

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:90%
they're choosing.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more you
open up, the more you do,

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.780 align:middle line:84%
because you realize it's not
just a physical exchange that's

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:90%
happening there.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
energetic overlap.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.242 align:middle line:84%
So I think that fits with what
you're saying about sleeping

00:30:25.242 --> 00:30:25.950 align:middle line:90%
next to somebody.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that's
an interesting topic

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that I think most
people find interesting.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to, but
in just a moment or so,

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.600 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have you go
into a channeling state,

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.150 align:middle line:90%
and the Z's will come through.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:90%
And I might ask them about that.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
we are making love?

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.250 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you meet
someone at 2:00 AM at a bar,

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:49.514 align:middle line:84%
for example, versus the
polar opposite of that?

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that might
be kind of fun.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ask them about it.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Please do.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
They like talking
about sex, actually.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, they do?

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:55.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.619 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because they use it
as a metaphor for two reasons.

00:30:57.619 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:84%
They say that we have
an inappropriate kind

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:84%
of shame-judgment
relationship with sex.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.172 align:middle line:84%
If you think about the natural
act of sex, there's no need to.

00:31:06.172 --> 00:31:07.380 align:middle line:90%
It's how we all arrived here.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of how
we've been conditioned.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But they also say that
sex is a brilliant way

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.808 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate what's
happening all of the time,

00:31:13.808 --> 00:31:16.970 align:middle line:84%
because you can find the same
routes of energy exchange

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.722 align:middle line:84%
in lovemaking with somebody
as sitting and having

00:31:19.722 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:90%
a coffee with somebody.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just a more
intensified version

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.680 align:middle line:90%
of the same energy scale.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we'll get into
the qualitative differences

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.980 align:middle line:90%
of how we go about that in life.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So on that, yeah, I think if we
just take about a little less

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.260 align:middle line:84%
than half this program to go
into it, that would be great.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Perfect, great.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we're
going to call in the Z's.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just let you take about
30 to 60 seconds to position

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:43.965 align:middle line:90%
yourself for reception.

00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:56.986 align:middle line:90%


00:31:56.986 --> 00:31:57.527 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Hm.

00:31:57.527 --> 00:31:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Good, the human is
settled, for this

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.500 align:middle line:90%
is what is always required.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.630 align:middle line:84%
You see the human
levels of density

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.825 align:middle line:84%
are quite different to
the communication field

00:32:08.825 --> 00:32:10.330 align:middle line:90%
that we need to open.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot of
energy that runs down here

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
on the ground, so information
does not travel as fast.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Hence the moment
of, shall we say,

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.630 align:middle line:84%
stillness of the channeler
before we can make

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:90%
our bridge of communication?

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:31.504 align:middle line:84%
A pleasure to be with you and
all who are in attendance.

00:32:31.504 --> 00:32:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you for
being willing to come

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:84%
into this environment
in this channel

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:90%
and do this with us today.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And we were just--
I assume you were

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:90%
listening in just a bit ago.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:42.512 align:middle line:90%
Or were you?

00:32:42.512 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We are
listening, but not

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.100 align:middle line:84%
necessarily in the way
that you would have it be.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.940 align:middle line:84%
We do not need to
follow the words,

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:84%
for the energy forms is what
is most interesting to us.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And humans use words to open
or close their energy forms.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So that is what we
pay attention to.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
one of the things

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that just came up,
randomly or not-- I

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:05.020 align:middle line:84%
think it was not randomly
in the conversation-- was

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about the
notion of what happens initially

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:84%
to people who sleep together
and where their fields start

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:15.420 align:middle line:84%
overlapping during sleep time,
absorbing each other's energies

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and issues and so
forth, which led

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.250 align:middle line:90%
to the subject of sexuality.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why don't
we talk to you about that?

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.150 align:middle line:84%
About what is
actually-- if you can

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:26.850 align:middle line:84%
paint us a brilliant
picture of what's

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:31.150 align:middle line:84%
going on energetically when
people are, first of all,

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.860 align:middle line:84%
making love in a
loving environment--

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.579 align:middle line:84%
a compatible, loving
environment with each other.

00:33:36.579 --> 00:33:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, this is an
opportunity for both parties

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.190 align:middle line:84%
to, as you would
say, fully light up.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is very powerful, for
it is a twofold experience.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the kundalini
energy in the body

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.370 align:middle line:84%
arises and spreads
so widely that people

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:55.490 align:middle line:84%
can, as we would say, leave
their bodies temporarily.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what many
will experience

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.500 align:middle line:84%
in the heights of
sexual ecstasy.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Many on your planet will
focus on the idea of orgasm

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:84%
as that point, and
yet we would say

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:09.250 align:middle line:84%
if the orgasm is the point where
the person is being lit up,

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:11.530 align:middle line:84%
then they are missing
the journey beforehand,

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:13.719 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
true, shall we say,

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:18.179 align:middle line:84%
spiritual weight of the sexual
experience with another loving

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:21.260 align:middle line:84%
being in a conscious
manner can be found.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.440 align:middle line:84%
You see, much of
the sexual activity

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that you are seeing at your time
on Earth is very base-focused.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It is focused in a
very physical way.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And what we often
see playing out

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:84%
is one person using another
body to, what you would call,

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.820 align:middle line:90%
get off.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:84%
But you see, that
is such a shame.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:45.070 align:middle line:84%
For if you are going to focus
your energy and attention

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:48.659 align:middle line:84%
on and with another person to
explore all aspects of that,

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:52.350 align:middle line:84%
beginning with the
simplicity of magnetic touch,

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.159 align:middle line:84%
you see, when one
human touches another,

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:57.320 align:middle line:84%
there is such a magnetic
force between them.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Think for a second, if you
will, of the difference

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.600 align:middle line:84%
between hugging somebody you
are very close to in your life,

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and your heart can light
up or expand a little

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.430 align:middle line:84%
through that, and the
experience of hugging

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.550 align:middle line:90%
a colleague for the first time.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Notice how you are different
in the way you open your energy

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:19.130 align:middle line:84%
field in both hugs, yet the
same action is occurring.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is how we could best
explain to you the difference

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:26.350 align:middle line:84%
between what you might refer
to as connected or disconnected

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:27.510 align:middle line:90%
sexuality.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I would
like to ask you about that.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying, what
I'm understanding,

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:37.390 align:middle line:84%
is in a loving situation, the
journey is where you are also

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.900 align:middle line:84%
sort of lifting out of
the physical experience,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.000 align:middle line:84%
the physical realms, not just
to have an orgasm together,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.440 align:middle line:90%
but the journey itself.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: In much the same
way that in meditation

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.150 align:middle line:84%
or for some people
visualizations

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:52.650 align:middle line:84%
or shamanic journeys or the
like-- it can be found in yoga

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:56.200 align:middle line:84%
or dance also-- there is
an ecstatic experience that

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.780 align:middle line:90%
happens that lights you up.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And once that lighting
up has happened,

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.070 align:middle line:90%
it is easy to return to.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.780 align:middle line:84%
It is not something
you easily forget.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So that is what we are
describing as taking place

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.200 align:middle line:90%
in this exchange.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And we will qualify
that the often

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:14.380 align:middle line:84%
idea of human loving
toward one another

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:84%
is caught up in
romantic notions.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of
partnership or even lover

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:25.820 align:middle line:84%
programming that you were fed
when you were all younger,

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and of course that your
generations prior were fed,

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:84%
we would say that what
is most important for you

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.820 align:middle line:84%
all to understand is holding
a great amount of love

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.870 align:middle line:84%
inside yourself, not getting
into servitude to another

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.010 align:middle line:84%
through your love towards
them or not being hungry

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:44.420 align:middle line:84%
for them to love you or
touch you in a certain way

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.090 align:middle line:90%
so that you know you are loved.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:47.940 align:middle line:90%
These are still human games.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you go beyond
the human games

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that once you open
your own heart, your own being,

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and then you are
standing before somebody

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:59.700 align:middle line:84%
who has the same frequency
inside themselves,

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:84%
so there is always mutual
respect for another being,

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.930 align:middle line:84%
then this kind of lovemaking
that you are asking about

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:09.420 align:middle line:84%
occurs very naturally and
with very little focus.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you tell us, if we
were watching an animated film

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:17.550 align:middle line:84%
or if we could see into
the energy fields, what

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.340 align:middle line:84%
does the combined
energy field-- what

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.300 align:middle line:84%
do our auras look like when
we surrendered ourselves

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.160 align:middle line:84%
to loving ourselves
and just showing up

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:84%
with another like
frequency in this act?

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: In that
act specifically,

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:33.500 align:middle line:84%
it would be a little like
watching 2D color movies become

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Technicolor 3D and beyond.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So there would be an
enormous expansion.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And so let's take you,
for example, Regina.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:43.380 align:middle line:84%
You would think that perhaps
if you joined with another,

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.540 align:middle line:84%
that the two of you together
would amplify to create

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.740 align:middle line:90%
double the energy field.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is,
the very minimum

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%
that you will create
with a true connection

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.750 align:middle line:84%
is four times the size of
your existing energy field.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And people can go
to 8, 12, and way

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.970 align:middle line:84%
beyond if they have
learned how to master this.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, the whole
point of doing it

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:84%
is breaking down the edge
of your energy field,

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:10.030 align:middle line:84%
or what you might call down
here the limited energy fields.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way that when
somebody begins to meditate,

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.030 align:middle line:84%
they realize that
they and the universe

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.180 align:middle line:84%
are far bigger than they
ever thought they were,

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.210 align:middle line:84%
it is the same with this act
of lovemaking, where two people

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.700 align:middle line:90%
collide to expand together.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.510 align:middle line:84%
They essentially
electrify each other.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And in that
electrification, there

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:31.650 align:middle line:84%
is an explosion
of color and size.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have read certain
doctrines and such about what

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.500 align:middle line:84%
can be done in that
capacity where you're

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.340 align:middle line:84%
at that elevated
level and you're

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.190 align:middle line:84%
mutually setting an
intention into motion.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us what happens if
a person can get to this point

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.190 align:middle line:84%
where they're expanding
their fields together,

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:53.950 align:middle line:84%
they're in individually
uplifted states,

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and they have an intention
in their mind and heart

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:84%
going into the act
together that they would

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.950 align:middle line:84%
like to expand, whether it's
for humanity, themselves,

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot?

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.140 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the
field of potential

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.870 align:middle line:90%
under those conditions?

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, direction
always gives the potential

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.910 align:middle line:90%
for further growth.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So in any act, whether it be
two people coming together

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.410 align:middle line:84%
to create something or whether
it be this act of lovemaking,

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:84%
where the two people will
join their intention--

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and we will be clear that
even if one party is even

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:26.600 align:middle line:84%
more invested in this and
more capable of holding

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:84%
this intention through the
act, the other party just being

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.390 align:middle line:84%
asked to name it or
focus on it, already

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:36.160 align:middle line:84%
creates a forward direction of
movement that is very helpful.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So never worry if you are
with a more skeptical partner.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.990 align:middle line:84%
If they are willing to
focus this intention,

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.880 align:middle line:84%
you will both have this
experience of growth.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.430 align:middle line:84%
But we would like to
say here that what's

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:90%
important to understand is this.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.290 align:middle line:84%
We are aware on your
planet there are often

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:56.790 align:middle line:84%
ideas of trying to access a
bigger, brighter, better state.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.300 align:middle line:84%
What is not so widely practiced
or understood at this time,

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.140 align:middle line:84%
although that is
coming more and more,

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.140 align:middle line:84%
is once you have amplified
your energy field

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.310 align:middle line:84%
through such an act as
intended, directed lovemaking

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.570 align:middle line:84%
with another, which
will surely give you

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.580 align:middle line:84%
a good guarantee in this area--
once you have done that, it

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.590 align:middle line:84%
is not so much that you
then should feel sorrowful

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:18.870 align:middle line:90%
on your return.

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.270 align:middle line:84%
It is that instead,
you have broken

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.640 align:middle line:84%
the edge of the perception
of what you are.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:84%
You have broken the edge of the
perception of what holds you

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.710 align:middle line:90%
back from universal light.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So once you have had this
amplification experience,

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:36.420 align:middle line:84%
you will always be just a
little bigger and brighter.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, and
this is the missing piece

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:42.670 align:middle line:84%
for humanity often,
it is how that then

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:47.050 align:middle line:84%
infuses every single action,
interaction, communication

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.170 align:middle line:90%
you will have on this planet.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Think of the loving
people that you know.

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are the ones who light
up a room most places they go.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Yes, like all of
you, they will have

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.650 align:middle line:84%
their tired days
or their days where

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.340 align:middle line:90%
they need to be in contraction.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But think of those people and
the simply energetic effect

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.310 align:middle line:84%
they have on an entire
group of people.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So the more people experience
this electrification,

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.210 align:middle line:84%
amplification that
we have referred to,

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.070 align:middle line:84%
whether it is through lovemaking
or some other practice,

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:18.320 align:middle line:84%
the more they will be carrying
that love around the world.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And love truly is the power to
transform not only this planet,

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:25.120 align:middle line:84%
but the very different destinies
that your timelines are

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.150 align:middle line:90%
currently playing with.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.960 align:middle line:90%
That's extraordinary.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's take that for a moment.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I am going to ask about
our timelines and our destiny

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.840 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to continue
on this one theme for a moment

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.985 align:middle line:90%
and look at the reverse lens.

00:41:39.985 --> 00:41:43.200 align:middle line:84%
It's 2 o'clock in the morning,
and human beings are at a bar

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:43.830 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:44.940 align:middle line:84%
They've been
looking desperately,

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.430 align:middle line:84%
haven't found anyone
for the night,

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and take someone home
and then have sex.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us more or
less what that kind of field

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.720 align:middle line:90%
would look or feel like?

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It is a little
like eating sugar.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So sugar can give you
an immediate rush,

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.970 align:middle line:84%
a high, a certain
effect on your chemistry

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.080 align:middle line:84%
that feels pleasurable
in the moment.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.250 align:middle line:84%
But depending on your body's
sensitivity, the next day,

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.890 align:middle line:90%
you will have a sugar hangover.

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people laugh
about their sugar hangovers,

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.300 align:middle line:84%
just as some people laugh
about their alcohol hangovers.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So that is not particularly
affecting them negatively,

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.010 align:middle line:84%
for they are in a
vibrational reality

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.050 align:middle line:84%
where to them, the
propulsion out of their body

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and then the drop back
in is quite normal

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and is the game they are playing
at that time in their life.

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.920 align:middle line:84%
So there is no judgment
on this, for it

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.580 align:middle line:84%
was their desperation and
their desire for intimacy that

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.350 align:middle line:90%
propelled them to this stranger.

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:84%
The shame of it is
that they needed

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.730 align:middle line:84%
not only that kind of
atmosphere, that kind

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:43.340 align:middle line:84%
of cover of night, but in
many cases, substances to,

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.870 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, lubricate
them for this event.

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But of course, in that
lubrication, what they do

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:84%
miss is grounded
consciousness of being.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.330 align:middle line:84%
They have propelled being,
and they have their party

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:57.290 align:middle line:84%
experience, but it is
never fully integrated,

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.460 align:middle line:84%
for they have to create
a different energy

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.270 align:middle line:84%
in their own energy
field before they are

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:03.190 align:middle line:90%
comfortable to move toward it.

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:05.600 align:middle line:84%
That is the fear of
intimacy on your planet.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So this strong desire
and pull towards intimacy

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:09.950 align:middle line:90%
is in all of you.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And yet in truth, it is one of
the most underdeveloped aspects

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:15.325 align:middle line:90%
of humanity at this time.

00:43:15.325 --> 00:43:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting
for the amount of space

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.222 align:middle line:90%
it takes up in our minds.

00:43:19.222 --> 00:43:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It takes up
space in your minds

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.890 align:middle line:84%
because you are
propelled to grow.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is your, shall
we say, DNA inheritance.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It is not such a
spiritual desire,

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:34.270 align:middle line:84%
for the truth of spirituality,
as you like to call it,

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:36.797 align:middle line:84%
is that the more truly
spiritual you become,

00:43:36.797 --> 00:43:39.380 align:middle line:84%
the more you start to understand
that everything is everything

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and the moment is all
that needs your focus,

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:46.330 align:middle line:84%
you begin to stop grasping or
needing growth experiences.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:48.480 align:middle line:84%
But you see, we say
this with some caution,

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.080 align:middle line:84%
for we are aware
that our words can

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.970 align:middle line:84%
be taken very literally
and very intently by some.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And to echo something
that Lee was speaking

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:59.280 align:middle line:84%
of, this is a thought
that we were aligned

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.500 align:middle line:84%
with in your earlier
conversation, self-judgment

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.980 align:middle line:84%
is one of the biggest killers on
your planet to people's spirit.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we
would cite it as one

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.370 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest
reasons for suicide

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:11.080 align:middle line:90%
at this time on your planet.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.750 align:middle line:90%
And I find it interesting.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:16.430 align:middle line:84%
The young generation
coming up-- we've

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:19.780 align:middle line:84%
all had our various behaviors,
dysfunctions, and beliefs

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.980 align:middle line:84%
as we go through time,
generation by generation.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:26.350 align:middle line:84%
But the younger generation,
let's say young 20s down

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:29.370 align:middle line:84%
into the young
teens and pubescent,

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.940 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting because you
have so many people coming

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:36.560 align:middle line:84%
in that are not bound
by the same mindsets

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.400 align:middle line:84%
that the previous
generations have been,

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time also
involve themselves in some

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.020 align:middle line:90%
of the most degrading behavior.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And again going
back to sexuality,

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.830 align:middle line:84%
with young girls
willing to do just about

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:51.570 align:middle line:84%
anything for a little bit
of attention from the boys,

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.340 align:middle line:90%
and how damaging is that?

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.246 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a different
consciousness behind it now?

00:44:56.246 --> 00:44:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It is
several things at once,

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:59.810 align:middle line:84%
but it is a very
good question to ask,

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:02.950 align:middle line:84%
for many have much
focus on the young.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
misconceptions flying around.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Just as there are wonderful
children coming through,

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.940 align:middle line:84%
there are many who will
speak of these children

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.090 align:middle line:90%
as being the savior.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.590 align:middle line:84%
But it is important to
remember they are still young,

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and they are coming up
through an energy field

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.310 align:middle line:84%
that they are having
to learn from.

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So what we will say
is that children today

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.900 align:middle line:84%
are far faster than
any of the children who

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.550 align:middle line:90%
have come in prior generations.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
this, it is logical,

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.190 align:middle line:84%
for they are moving into a more
widely dispersed energy field

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.030 align:middle line:90%
than any of you were born into.

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:36.290 align:middle line:84%
The diversity has
grown, but so, too,

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:40.210 align:middle line:84%
has this driving force around
disconnection and fear.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:44.610 align:middle line:84%
We say driving force because
it is not so much perpetuated

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:47.120 align:middle line:90%
by humanity by choice.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:51.370 align:middle line:84%
There are certain aspects
of your society-- again,

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:53.820 align:middle line:84%
we will use this term
that was referred

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:58.650 align:middle line:84%
to-- shall you say shadow
aspects of society that

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:01.320 align:middle line:84%
will try to incite
fear and disconnection

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.030 align:middle line:84%
through certain energies
that are put out

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:06.030 align:middle line:84%
through both
entertainment and media

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:09.540 align:middle line:84%
but also very calculated
moves that are made

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.780 align:middle line:90%
to infiltrate certain groups.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.020 align:middle line:84%
What we will say that
is wonderful for you

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.930 align:middle line:84%
all to know about this is
that the children of today

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:20.110 align:middle line:84%
are not as distracted
or as disconnected

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:23.200 align:middle line:84%
as they may appear to be in
the very deep, dark moments

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.580 align:middle line:90%
they go into.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.850 align:middle line:84%
They will find that many of
the things they are distracted

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:31.080 align:middle line:84%
by become hollow to
them very soon, for what

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.550 align:middle line:84%
they were born into was a world
that was told it was crumbling.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And we will be clear here that
the fastest way to bring down

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.440 align:middle line:84%
a world is to have all
of its people panic

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.270 align:middle line:90%
that it is about to die.

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have said this many times
in channels over the years.

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.940 align:middle line:84%
You must understand that when
you find yourself in fear,

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.480 align:middle line:84%
it is very important
to overcome that fear,

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.930 align:middle line:84%
for fear is often
used as a force

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.400 align:middle line:84%
to create the very
destruction that you are told

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.610 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But that is a way of
harnessing people's energy

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.860 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why
you must always

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.300 align:middle line:84%
return to love and light
to the best of your ability

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.980 align:middle line:90%
whenever you encounter fear.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And we will say that
of these children.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they are playing with
different disconnections.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But why you are so alarmed,
some of you who look on,

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.710 align:middle line:84%
is they are, how
shall we say, playing

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.910 align:middle line:90%
some rapid karmic healings.

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So whereas the rest of you have
gone through things, perhaps

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.370 align:middle line:84%
you are on lifetime
number five, Regina,

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:31.110 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime, which is
the biggest amount of lives

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:33.740 align:middle line:84%
that you have had
yet in one lifetime,

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.480 align:middle line:84%
they are actually, some
of them, already entering

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.130 align:middle line:84%
lifetime four and five
as they hit their 20s.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So it does not look as
grounded as a person

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:45.250 align:middle line:84%
like you, because they have not
yet had time to form or ground

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:46.030 align:middle line:90%
who they are.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.100 align:middle line:90%
But what we will say is this.

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.170 align:middle line:84%
There is something in the
encoding of the people

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:54.050 align:middle line:84%
who have been born in
the last 10 to 20 years,

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:58.110 align:middle line:84%
that once they hit 20 years
old and beyond, just as many

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:01.260 align:middle line:84%
of you who have awakened are now
finding it difficult to sustain

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.550 align:middle line:84%
some of the physical
habits or attitudes

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.170 align:middle line:84%
that you used to have because
your frequencies have lightened

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:09.710 align:middle line:84%
up so much, you will see
a lot of 20-somethings

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:12.480 align:middle line:84%
suddenly hitting their
stride in a way that will not

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.270 align:middle line:84%
make any linear sense to
those of you who have watched

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:17.550 align:middle line:84%
the path of others
over the last 30, 40,

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:19.110 align:middle line:84%
50 years, because
you will have never

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.770 align:middle line:90%
seen it done this way before.

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But what we will say is
when these children land,

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.930 align:middle line:84%
they will really land, and they
will land in a very activated

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.357 align:middle line:84%
way very quickly
that in the past,

00:48:29.357 --> 00:48:31.440 align:middle line:84%
people would have had to
go through a much longer,

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.410 align:middle line:90%
linear growth trajectory.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:36.640 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we will say
is they are, to some degree,

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.850 align:middle line:84%
cleaning up a lot
of the darkness that

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:42.460 align:middle line:84%
has been suppressed in other
generations that is now

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.910 align:middle line:90%
being acted out by the young.

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And we would say that if
you flashed back 40 years

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and had the same framework in
place, the generation of all

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:53.340 align:middle line:84%
of you that are
here now and older,

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.804 align:middle line:84%
you would have been doing
exactly the same thing.

00:48:55.804 --> 00:48:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this brings
me to the thought

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:06.764 align:middle line:84%
of the phenomenon of more girls
than boys cutting themselves.

00:49:06.764 --> 00:49:08.430 align:middle line:84%
You can see this
phenomenon I'm speaking

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:11.170 align:middle line:84%
about, teenage
girls in particular

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.720 align:middle line:84%
cutting themselves repeatedly
on their body, their arms

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.720 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Is this part of the
releasing of the dark energy

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.060 align:middle line:90%
or pain of the planet?

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Or what is this?

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: One way to
disempower a man is

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.030 align:middle line:84%
to deny him his connection
to his own feelings.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And so it has been the case
that for centuries, men

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.850 align:middle line:84%
have been discouraged
from their feelings.

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:35.470 align:middle line:84%
This created an empathy
overload in the women.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:38.830 align:middle line:84%
For the two forces to combine
and have chemical attraction

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and balance, a balance
has to be achieved.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.440 align:middle line:84%
So if a man is used
to disconnecting

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.930 align:middle line:84%
from his feelings, a woman
will deeply connect to hers.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, what we are
speaking about here is very

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:54.350 align:middle line:84%
person-by-person specific,
and you cannot speak in such

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:56.390 align:middle line:84%
general terms about
every individual.

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:59.160 align:middle line:84%
But we will say that
the internalization

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.130 align:middle line:84%
of emotional pain
is a far more, still

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:05.200 align:middle line:84%
to this day, a feminine
or female gender

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.430 align:middle line:84%
issue than it has ever
been with the men.

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But you are beginning
to see that change.

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:11.660 align:middle line:84%
You are seeing very
male females and you

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.090 align:middle line:90%
are seeing very feminine men.

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So the cutting, we
will say is, again,

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.980 align:middle line:84%
an acting out of much of the
chaos and destruction that

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.550 align:middle line:84%
has risen to the
surface that before

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:25.810 align:middle line:84%
was very suppressed
and held down

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:27.924 align:middle line:90%
and discouraged in your society.

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do we work
with these young people who

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:31.381 align:middle line:90%
are going through this process?

00:50:31.381 --> 00:50:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I hear a lot of it, and
it's so painful for the parents

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:37.552 align:middle line:90%
to watch and to be witness to.

00:50:37.552 --> 00:50:40.510 align:middle line:84%
What do we do as the
parents and those

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:42.730 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the
children that are

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:44.377 align:middle line:90%
expressing pain in this way?

00:50:44.377 --> 00:50:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: One of the
things that has changed

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:48.580 align:middle line:84%
in your society in the
last 20 to 30 years

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:51.820 align:middle line:84%
is an overload of
pressure on, shall we say,

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:54.460 align:middle line:84%
achievements and results
within the school systems.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And this was, again,
very deliberate,

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.740 align:middle line:84%
for it divorces people
from their souls

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.519 align:middle line:90%
if you give them too much to do.

00:51:00.519 --> 00:51:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So that is one of
the things that you

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:03.470 align:middle line:90%
are seeing as prevalent.

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And while we understand that
changing the school systems

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:10.260 align:middle line:84%
from the inside is a very
slow march, what many of you

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.590 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
do is to recognize

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.400 align:middle line:84%
the need for other
things around the school.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So whether it is that
you set up a group

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to take teenage girls out
into the wilderness, whatever

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.980 align:middle line:84%
it is that you feel compelled
to do to start bringing

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.790 align:middle line:90%
that voice to a group of girls.

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And we would like
to qualify this.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.750 align:middle line:84%
You might be somebody
who sets this up

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:33.120 align:middle line:84%
for a group of 20 girls in
one state in your country.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And you would think, well,
I'm not helping every girl.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.790 align:middle line:84%
But do not forget
the ripple effect.

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Once you are doing
it somewhere, it

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:41.520 align:middle line:84%
starts to become
more normal, and all

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.920 align:middle line:84%
of those girls who benefit
from re-finding themselves,

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.110 align:middle line:84%
because they are no
longer having to contract

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:49.930 align:middle line:84%
into themselves because they
feel there is nowhere for them

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:52.914 align:middle line:84%
to truly live and breathe
in that society, all

00:51:52.914 --> 00:51:54.580 align:middle line:84%
of those girls will
be affected and will

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.540 align:middle line:90%
go on and share the same gift.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is why for many
years we have said,

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:02.160 align:middle line:84%
do not get overwhelmed
with the large picture.

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Try to recognize what
stimulates, inspires, and fires

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:09.900 align:middle line:84%
you inside, and go and bring
your action to that area,

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:13.000 align:middle line:84%
for you can guarantee it
will be a passion for you.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But it will also be
you playing your part

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:19.090 align:middle line:84%
of a large tapestry of what
we would call reconnection.

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:21.920 align:middle line:84%
That is what is going on
when someone is self-harming

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.840 align:middle line:84%
or damaging their body in
any way through addiction,

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.040 align:middle line:84%
or through denial
or suppression.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:31.120 align:middle line:84%
It is a belief that their love,
their size of energy cannot be

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.140 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And it is one of the diseases
afflicting your society,

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:36.980 align:middle line:90%
the idea of smallness.

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Competition and lack are
two of the areas that

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:41.830 align:middle line:90%
will keep this perpetuated.

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you are in an age
where people are breaking open.

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Because they cannot not.

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I have one final
question at this time,

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:53.275 align:middle line:84%
and then I would
love for Lee and you

00:52:53.275 --> 00:52:56.220 align:middle line:84%
to come back another time and
we'll have another discussion.

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned timelines
and destiny of humanity.

00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:04.393 align:middle line:84%
Can you paint a picture for
us as you see it at this time,

00:53:04.393 --> 00:53:08.200 align:middle line:84%
on the timeline we're on, and
maybe even a parallel timeline,

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.864 align:middle line:90%
the destiny of humanity?

00:53:09.864 --> 00:53:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It is good you
mention parallel timelines,

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:14.685 align:middle line:84%
for there are several timelines
occurring right now on Earth.

00:53:14.685 --> 00:53:16.726 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
realities and dimensions

00:53:16.726 --> 00:53:18.410 align:middle line:90%
occurring simultaneously.

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Even someone at
your shoulder can be

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:21.850 align:middle line:90%
in another dimension at times.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:24.640 align:middle line:84%
But what we will talk about
is the heated question

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:28.170 align:middle line:84%
on everyone's minds--
the idea of world doom,

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:30.740 align:middle line:90%
world disaster, world control.

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:34.510 align:middle line:84%
All of these things really
speak of the same survival fear,

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:36.830 align:middle line:84%
the same idea that
you individually

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:39.340 align:middle line:84%
as humans, or the
planet and humanity

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.340 align:middle line:90%
will not survive this shift.

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.580 align:middle line:84%
That was never
what was intended.

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And there is a great
deal of what you often

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:50.180 align:middle line:84%
refer to as this disinformation
out there in order to keep,

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.430 align:middle line:84%
especially those believers,
those manifesters,

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:55.060 align:middle line:84%
such as many of your
group who are actively

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:58.870 align:middle line:84%
manifesting the future, in fear
so they will help to manifest

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:00.620 align:middle line:90%
the more negative timelines.

00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.050 align:middle line:84%
What we will say is
at this point in time,

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:06.290 align:middle line:84%
there are eight possible future
realities lined up for Earth.

00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:08.760 align:middle line:84%
But we will tell you that
it is very hard for us

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.400 align:middle line:84%
to speak to you about this in
linear, quantifiable terms,

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.890 align:middle line:84%
because it's simply-- it
would be like giving you

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:18.130 align:middle line:84%
a map of a planet
you have never seen

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and to try and understand it
or for us to try and relay it,

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:22.630 align:middle line:90%
is very tricky.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But what we will
tell you is this.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.310 align:middle line:84%
What all of you must
understand and hold to is

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:32.520 align:middle line:84%
there is a strong survival
urge within this race.

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And there is a strong
survival within this planet.

00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And so there will be
adaptation all along the way.

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest
focus for all of you

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:45.490 align:middle line:84%
has to be your own sovereignty
and your own hearts.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:47.605 align:middle line:84%
Now, we understand this
may seem very vague,

00:54:47.605 --> 00:54:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and people want
concrete solution.

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:51.730 align:middle line:90%
But listen to what we said.

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:55.030 align:middle line:84%
If you go into your own
sovereignty and your own heart,

00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:58.130 align:middle line:84%
you will start to live
the way you want to live,

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and through that, you
will be shining brightly

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.290 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:03.620 align:middle line:84%
The more bright lights
there are on this planet,

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:06.350 align:middle line:84%
the more the darkness
starts to get smaller.

00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:08.980 align:middle line:84%
We understand many of you
talk about the darkness being

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.010 align:middle line:90%
high at the moment.

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And yes, in energy terms, you
are definitely experiencing

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:14.170 align:middle line:90%
that to some degree.

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But we will actually qualify
this by saying in many ways,

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.200 align:middle line:90%
the darkness is less.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.790 align:middle line:84%
There are less dark
people in your population

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:23.350 align:middle line:90%
than have ever been.

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is why the opening
and rising of humanity

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:30.780 align:middle line:84%
to themselves, to loving
action, to consciousness

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.760 align:middle line:84%
is the absolute
force for change.

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
reasons you are convinced

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:39.760 align:middle line:84%
otherwise-- fear
implants or by stories

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.420 align:middle line:84%
from those who wish to try
and steer it another way.

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.190 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, it is near
impossible for them to do that

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:47.650 align:middle line:84%
because the density
simply cannot hold with

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:50.550 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness that the
planet is now radiating.

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.730 align:middle line:84%
You all must stay on
your own personal path.

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you hit
these survival fears,

00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:58.370 align:middle line:84%
the best thing you
can do for yourselves

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:01.550 align:middle line:84%
is to let go of your
personal fear of death.

00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if you all let go of
your personal fears of death,

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.680 align:middle line:84%
none of you would be
running this fear so much

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.020 align:middle line:84%
about what is going to
happen in the future.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:11.010 align:middle line:90%
We promise you that.

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Even though some
of you might say,

00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.444 align:middle line:84%
it is not death we are afraid
of, it is planetary suffering,

00:56:15.444 --> 00:56:16.985 align:middle line:84%
we tell you that if
you are suffering

00:56:16.985 --> 00:56:19.080 align:middle line:84%
to such a degree as a
human that it is not

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.810 align:middle line:84%
serving you or
your soul, you will

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:23.150 align:middle line:90%
exit the planet in an instant.

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So you all have to trust not
only your hearts, but the truth

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of many of the prophecies
that you have heard

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.820 align:middle line:90%
that you are in a shift time.

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.290 align:middle line:84%
What we will say is
if your minds try

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and work out how it's going
to look or try and work out

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.700 align:middle line:84%
how it looks right now,
you will be very confused.

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So you have to keep going within
and trust your individual path

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and trust that when you look
back 20 to 30 years from now,

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:51.070 align:middle line:84%
then you will be able to
speak about what the shift was

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.100 align:middle line:84%
all about and what
it looked like.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, working
on your own strength,

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.600 align:middle line:84%
your own love, your own
self-care, and your own growth

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:03.190 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely the way
to guarantee the biggest

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and brightest life not
only for yourself, but also

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:10.424 align:middle line:84%
for every single
individual on this planet.

00:57:10.424 --> 00:57:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow,
thank you for that.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.631 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
add one little thing,

00:57:13.631 --> 00:57:14.880 align:middle line:90%
because it came up.

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I was waking up a couple of
days ago in crossover status,

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:21.380 align:middle line:84%
saw a little face and
little simian kind of eyes.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:23.470 align:middle line:90%
And it said to me, what is hope?

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And it said, hope
is the expression

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:28.040 align:middle line:90%
of the soul's desire.

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Does that mean anything?

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Ha.

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:33.460 align:middle line:84%
It is a gift to you,
for you yourself

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.340 align:middle line:84%
are somebody who has powered
a great deal of her life

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.770 align:middle line:90%
on faith and hope.

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is something that
you have shared and spread

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:40.880 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.120 align:middle line:84%
That is one of your
legacies, Regina.

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.200 align:middle line:84%
You are somebody who has
given hope to many thousands

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.900 align:middle line:90%
upon thousands of people.

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:50.050 align:middle line:90%
And hope is a contagious energy.

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So your desire has been to bring
hope, openness, and expansion.

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is what this
reflection was telling you.

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:00.290 align:middle line:84%
You have achieved your goal,
although your goal is far,

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:01.610 align:middle line:90%
far from over.

00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:03.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, your
coming chapters will

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:06.602 align:middle line:84%
be the most interesting chapters
for you in your life yet.

00:58:06.602 --> 00:58:07.810 align:middle line:90%
And that is saying something.

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.909 align:middle line:84%
Well, on that note,
thank you so much

00:58:10.909 --> 00:58:12.700 align:middle line:84%
for that on a personal
level, but thank you

00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:15.340 align:middle line:84%
on a broad level for all of
the information you've given us

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.070 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I thanks
you on behalf of all of us,

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and we will say
goodbye to you for now

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and see Lee back for just a
moment before we sign off.

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:26.450 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: In peace and
in love to all listeners.

00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:31.060 align:middle line:90%


00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, hi.

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.320 align:middle line:90%
That was beautiful.

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:36.690 align:middle line:84%
You have some lovely
beings there, very clear,

00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:40.140 align:middle line:84%
very clear information
and approachable.

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.717 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, I enjoyed that.

00:58:42.717 --> 00:58:44.050 align:middle line:90%
I've heard a lot of channelings.

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoyed that.

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Thank you.

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:47.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know that
our viewers have enjoyed.

00:58:47.575 --> 00:58:49.020 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of wisdom in that.

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And we only scratched the
surface of a subject or two.

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So with that, perhaps you'll
be interested in coming back

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.760 align:middle line:90%
another day?

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I would love to.

00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:56.515 align:middle line:90%
I would love to, yeah.

00:58:56.515 --> 00:58:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Lee.

00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:58.723 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Thank you.

00:58:58.723 --> 00:58:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.
