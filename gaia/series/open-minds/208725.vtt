00:00:09.022 --> 00:00:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Sardinia
has one of the highest

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.770 align:middle line:84%
percentages of DNA from
over 8,000 years ago.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.270 align:middle line:84%
People who are 8
feet tall-- there's

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.562 align:middle line:84%
an actual measurement of them
in the back of the Temple

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:19.200 align:middle line:90%
of Karnak, which is very handy.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Exactly on the winter solstice
of 5300 BC, the belt of Orion

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:84%
rises for the first time over
that hollow for 33 minutes,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.190 align:middle line:90%
perfect alignment.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: You
were talking about one

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:84%
of these stones that served
as an interdimensional portal.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Which stone circle was that?

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And tell us about that.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.620 align:middle line:90%
What about the comet stone?

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I like this story,
this nocturnal meeting

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.810 align:middle line:90%
place for giants.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: If you fail
to pay attention

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.692 align:middle line:84%
to the rhythm of the stone
circle and what it's there for,

00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
then you lose track of
the rhythm of the lands,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and then everything
falls apart with it.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.787 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you
end up like us today.

00:00:52.787 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Nefertiti
is not a name.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a phrase.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.757 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the history
changes, if that is accurate.

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, you
have the Alba kings

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and queens buried there,
kings and queens from Britain.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
You have some of the
French kings there.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that was shocking.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.489 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: A British prime
minister, and then you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.606 align:middle line:90%
have, as well, Macbeth.

00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:06.992 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:06.992 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.005 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So what is
it with this place?

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.142 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.142 --> 00:01:15.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Last time Freddy
and I adventured together,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:10%
it was in Sardinia.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:10%
Now he's going to take us on
the road to ancient Scotland.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:84%
In putting the
pieces together, he's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
learned that there was a
migratory path between Scotland

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and Armenia connected
by sacred buildings,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:84%
language, and players
better known in Mesopotamia.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, Freddy, so first
of all, welcome back.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Thank you.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And secondly, it was
really that trip to Sardinia

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that started tripping
all these wires for you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:84%
as you started digging down
into what was happening there,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and it was crossing-- it
was showing up in Armenia.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And that got this whole
adventure going for you.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's all your fault.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all my fault.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I'm blaming you.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm happy to take
responsibility for that.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about-- let's start

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
with what happened in Sardinia
just briefly that started

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.110 align:middle line:84%
showing you ties to Armenia
and between Armenia and ancient

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Britain.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.493 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, it was
the fact that they

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:84%
had these beautiful
conical towers which

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:84%
are identical to
the conical towers

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
that we find in Scotland
and in northern Scotland

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:90%
and the islands.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.495 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows
how they got there.

00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:10%
They're a complete
anomaly in Scotland.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:10%
And the other thing was
that Sardinia is also

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:10%
full of these horn mounds,
very unusual things,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:10%
and they look like
they have a horn

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:10%
forecourt with a
big stela in front

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.563 align:middle line:10%
with a hole in the center
where nobody's buried.

00:02:28.563 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
They have these
connections with giants,

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.998 align:middle line:84%
but the giants were
never buried there.

00:02:31.998 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But we have the same thing
a thousand years later

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:90%
in Scotland as well.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:10%
We didn't know where
they came from,

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:10%
but the thing that
really nagged at me

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:10%
was the fact that
nobody in Sardinia

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:10%
could explain why the
whole culture's called

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.790 align:middle line:10%
the Nuragic culture--

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to bring that up--

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: --or where
"Nuragic" comes from.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --what that meant.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So you talk
to local people.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:90%
You talk to academics.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:84%
The archaeologists have
said, we don't know.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And I figured, well, it's
got to come from somewhere.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.830 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be an
etymological print

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:90%
here somewhere.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And one thing led to the other.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I began to look at how the
culture moves from Sardinia

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
around Sicily to
Malta, which also

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
has its own very
original culture,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.385 align:middle line:84%
and they had similar
things there.

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
look at the words.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.593 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, they've
got [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:03:09.593 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
which means sort of a holy
person, which is also a white,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:90%
shining, holy person.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't
satisfying enough.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, when I went back
to Armenia and I start picking

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.983 align:middle line:84%
around their dictionary
and all their etymology,

00:03:22.983 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
they actually had the
word [NON-ENGLISH]

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.645 align:middle line:90%
in their language.

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So a [NON-ENGLISH] is
a holy person or a holy

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:90%
representative.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the towers
began to make a lot of sense

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.690 align:middle line:84%
as places that were used by a
priesthood that was set aside

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:84%
from the local population,
because the same story was

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:84%
happening in the
Scottish islands as well.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.385 align:middle line:84%
There was a group
of people there

00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:84%
that did not belong to
the local population.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
They behave differently, spoke
a completely different language,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and they have the
same descriptions

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.248 align:middle line:84%
as the people in
Sardinia and also

00:03:49.248 --> 00:03:50.915 align:middle line:84%
the Caucasian-looking
people in Armenia.

00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and when
and I encourage anybody

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and take a look
at our Sardinia series, OK?

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Gaia archives.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
You can see some of what
Freddy's talking about.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we went into
some of these structures--

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:90%
and I remember the one up north.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:84%
You might remember
the name of it.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Ruju.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.067 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ruju, right.

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:84%
When we went up north,
when we were in there,

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.492 align:middle line:84%
I was just dialing in and
meditating and watching

00:04:10.492 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:90%
what that was used for.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And it very much
supported what you

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
were finding in
your research, which

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.630 align:middle line:84%
is there was a group of people
that came to find the best

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and brightest of
the local population

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and begin educating
and training them.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And I saw them training
them in these structures

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.982 align:middle line:84%
so that they could take these
gifts, such as remote viewing

00:04:31.982 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and healing and such, forward
into their own culture.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And these guys go bye-bye
somewhere else, maybe

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:90%
to Scotland.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so there's that.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.187 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And there's a
genetic fingerprint now

00:04:40.187 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
that's been found out where
Sardinia has one of the highest

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.487 align:middle line:84%
percentages of DNA that comes
from the pre-Neolithic period

00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in the whole of Europe.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So the genetic
structure of people

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
is still there from
over 8,000 years ago,

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and the genetic lines
trail all the way back

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.300 align:middle line:84%
to the Armenian Highlands,
Ukraine, and Siberia.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:90%
So that was a big connection.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
But from there, the DNA
lines also trace to Scotland.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So 24% of the people
in Scotland today

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
carry those genetic fingerprints
that goes all the way back

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:90%
to Armenia.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.580 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't see that
one coming at all.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.933 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Fred, let's just
backtrack a little bit.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone talks
about the great deluge.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.062 align:middle line:84%
It's in all the world's
traditions, right?

00:05:19.062 --> 00:05:19.895 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:05:19.895 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The deluge.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, so here, we have a flood.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It sounds better when
it's said in French as well.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, great deluge.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Deluge.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
rather than flood.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, there was a big flood.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I never fully understood,
after that great flood,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
after the Younger Dryas
period and the Earth

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
was covered in water, what
percentage of the population

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
was thought to have
been lost at that time?

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And where were the remnants
of civilization most prominent

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:90%
at that time?

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.295 align:middle line:84%
Because it would have
to be in higher--

00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I would think in more
mountainous regions, for one.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
gets into all kinds.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.758 align:middle line:84%
It's the Basque region
and Mount Picos and such.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a different story.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us about
what was left after that,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:84%
so when we're looking at things
in terms of 8,000 years ago,

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:84%
we understand what
you're talking about--

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.285 align:middle line:90%
remnants of DNA.

00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It goes
back to the time

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of when we have some articles
left by the Book of Enoch

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:84%
that were written by
somebody else that

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.225 align:middle line:84%
was written by
somebody else that

00:06:18.225 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:90%
was copied by somebody else.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you matched that
with the Indian texts

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and also the Egyptian
surviving texts of that period,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're all pretty adamant
about this, the Egyptians

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
even more so because
they said most

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
of the holy inhabitants
of those islands

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
where the gods used
to live perished.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.152 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them, but
there were groups of them

00:06:35.152 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:90%
that were lucky enough.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm quoting this directly now.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
They were lucky enough
to be caught at sea

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.275 align:middle line:90%
when the big waves--

00:06:41.275 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
because to them, they would
just be enormous waves.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Once you get close to the--

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Huge tsunamis.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --land shelf,
you get tsunami.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying that
most of the holy inhabitants

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:90%
of those islands perished.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:84%
The few that
survived would set up

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.060 align:middle line:84%
the basis for the
points of civilization

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
that humans would
pick up from them.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Post flood.

00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But they also said that
at least 90% of all humanity

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.510 align:middle line:84%
perished as well, and 90% of
at least all the giants covered

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.848 align:middle line:84%
with red hair, the Nephilim
or their offspring,

00:07:08.848 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
which is the whole
purpose behind the flood

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:90%
anyway, to wipe out that lot.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But they survived in little
pockets here and there,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:84%
specifically
actually in Ireland.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:84%
They were still living
there as the Fomorians

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and also around the Scottish
islands as the Fomorians.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.017 align:middle line:84%
So 5,000 years later, when
the Caucasians moved there

00:07:25.017 --> 00:07:27.600 align:middle line:84%
with the Neolithic people, they
found them still living there.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like,
well, we didn't

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.017 align:middle line:84%
get enough-- we didn't
get rid of all of them.

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we
obviously lost a lot of DNA.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.383 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: A huge amount,
but it persists.

00:07:35.383 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But some
of it persists.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Not all of it.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming not all of
it, but as you just said,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
there were those who were
fortunate enough to be at sea.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, often these people
were also seers and viewers.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
They knew, and they knew
that trouble was coming.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.198 align:middle line:84%
And they knew to go, and they
knew also where to resituate.

00:07:51.198 --> 00:07:53.157 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, they knew
exactly what was coming.

00:07:53.157 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They knew were to go
to reseed life and knowledge

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.010 align:middle line:90%
once the waters receded.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, I would
think that there probably

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
was some higher level
of and knowledge of

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
and an agenda toward preserving
as much of the DNA of humanity

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But you start
getting to the inbreeding.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was the one thing
that was very predominant

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:84%
in the studies is that the
fact that these people who

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.057 align:middle line:84%
are much taller than
ordinary humans-- they're

00:08:20.057 --> 00:08:21.683 align:middle line:90%
about 8 feet tall.

00:08:21.683 --> 00:08:23.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's an
actual measurement of them

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the Temple
of Karnak in Egypt,

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:90%
which is very handy.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't able to
breed with human women

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:90%
successfully at first.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And the Wichita of Oklahoma
have the same story.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:84%
They said that the
gods were here.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:90%
They were much taller than us.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.913 align:middle line:84%
They tried to take wives, but
they died during childbirth

00:08:41.913 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:84%
because they gave birth
to infants, of course.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, of course, yeah.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And also, their
DNA wasn't the same as ours,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:84%
but over time, they seem to have
succeeded because the Egyptians

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:84%
talk about a time
when there was a group

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:84%
of half human, half divine
people governing certain places

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.510 align:middle line:90%
around the Earth.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:84%
They obviously
succeeded because they

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.213 align:middle line:84%
couldn't keep interbreeding
because it was basically

00:09:01.213 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:84%
breaking down their
DNA structure.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you
had to have hybrids

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.550 align:middle line:90%
that then bred with each other.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:84%
That would make sense,
until the bodies were

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:84%
more normal human size so that
it could successfully be done.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.783 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, just
wanted to lay that.

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So now we're talking
about at this time,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.140 align:middle line:84%
you're finding Armenian
DNA in Scotland.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and we're
finding similar structures,

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:90%
the nuraghe.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to Orkney, OK?

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to talk about
some of the stories surrounding

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:90%
some of these stones.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.120 align:middle line:84%
This was about, what,
5000 BC, Circle of--

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: About 5300 BC.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How do you say it?

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Stenness?

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Stenness?

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Stenness.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, Circle of
Stenness, these stones--

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:35.962 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: There'll be subtitles.

00:09:35.962 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --monolithic
stones, and we'll see it here.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about the
Circle of Stenness.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, I love that place.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Originally, there was
about 11 monolithic stones,

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.147 align:middle line:84%
and they're about
19.5 feet tall,

00:09:48.147 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
which incredibly is
a measurement that

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:84%
keeps popping up over
the Scottish stones again

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.750 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're standing on
their center of gravity,

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.427 align:middle line:84%
and they're only about this
thick, about 6 to 8 inches.

00:09:59.427 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
they're slender slabs.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Incredible,
incredible things.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.537 align:middle line:84%
They chalked on the
ground to about this deep,

00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
so they obviously knew
what they were doing.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like a sort of a
council or a meeting place.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
impression I was left with.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.517 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't a place where
they were measuring things

00:10:14.517 --> 00:10:15.770 align:middle line:90%
like in most stone circles.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
The one up the road
is very different.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, up
until the historical era,

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
there were stories that there
was a council meeting that

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.172 align:middle line:90%
used to take place there.

00:10:24.172 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was also a place where
very distinguished people who

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:84%
wore white robes or
white tunics just

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:84%
spoke a completely
different language

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:90%
to either Scandinavian or--

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I going to say Glaswegian but
not the Scottish, in which case

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.772 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't understand them.

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But they were very,
very different.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
They came from somewhere
else, and they actually

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.378 align:middle line:84%
referred to them as
strangers from afar.

00:10:43.378 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So they obviously knew
these people did not

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:90%
belong in this part of Europe.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So they're associated
intimately with these places.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.070 align:middle line:90%
The one up the road is Brodgar--

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.350 align:middle line:84%
retains the memory
of a word which

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:84%
is actually both Armenian
and Egyptian, which

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.670 align:middle line:90%
I found extraordinary.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the story
begins to sort of really

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:90%
come along.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.453 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
third site at the top

00:11:04.453 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that nobody ever goes to
because the stones have all

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
been pilfered for fence
posts or making buildings.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sad.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's
Bookan, the Ring of Bookan,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's the most
important one of them

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.388 align:middle line:84%
all because it has
a light box in there

00:11:15.388 --> 00:11:16.430 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of a mound.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.097 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What do you
mean, a light box?

00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: It's a long orthostatic
box made of, in this case,

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:10%
very thin pieces of sandstone.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And no one was
ever buried in it.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
They only ever found
two pieces of, I think,

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:84%
animal bone and one piece
of skull in the actual mound

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:90%
itself, but nothing inside.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.363 align:middle line:84%
And just like in Sardinia,
they have the hole at the front

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
as though you're meant
to use the box to align

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.517 align:middle line:90%
something in the horizon.

00:11:39.517 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
meant by a light box.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:84%
There was a light of
something in the horizon

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.675 align:middle line:84%
like a star, a planet,
or some constellation

00:11:45.675 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:84%
that at a certain given time
would memorialize the time when

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:90%
the place was built.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is the art
of archaeoastronomy

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
where, when all things fail,
where you have no folklore,

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:84%
where you have no
breadcrumbs of etymology,

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
where the stories
disappear, now you

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
have the time when all
across the Earth, people,

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:84%
when they built their
temples and their mounds--

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you can
go to cosmic wisdom.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --on the horizon.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to the alignment
of things in the horizon, which

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:90%
we can now do.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, was that built
in a similar time,

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.888 align:middle line:84%
roughly 7,000 years
ago, as Stenness?

00:12:14.888 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They seem to have
come at the same time.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you're standing
at the top of the ridge,

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:84%
you've got all the three
circles in alignment, but not.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
One of them is ever
so slightly off,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
two big circles,
one smaller one.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking,
it can't possibly

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:84%
be that simple,
the belt of Orion.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:90%
It can't be that simple.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, if you stand
in front of the orthostatic box

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and look at the horizon,
the Orkney landscape

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.660 align:middle line:84%
forms a beautiful bowl
right in front of it

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.840 align:middle line:84%
as though something is meant
to come out of it or descend.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And you just basically
do your calculations,

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and exactly on the winter
solstice of 5300 BC,

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:84%
the belt of Orion rises
for the first time

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:84%
over that hollow for 33
minutes, only 33 minutes.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect alignment.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So for once, the box is not
aligned to the sun or the moon

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
as we'd expect, but
at the same time,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:84%
that alignment also mimics
what's on the ground.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Those three circles
actually mimic the belt

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:90%
stars on the ground in reverse.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would this
be similar to the pyramids

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:90%
at Giza?

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, next
step was to figure out--

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
let's get a really good
diagram of the Giza pyramids.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So I've got a really good survey
from Harvard, highly accurate.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, you just
reverse the blueprint.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Do it as a mirror
image, and the peak

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
of every pyramid
in the Giza Plateau

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
hits the center of
the three circles

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
right down to
within like 2 feet.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So whoever was in
Egypt also had the same--

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was in Scotland.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.445 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --knowhow
to be in Scotland.

00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let me ask you a
couple of practical questions

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:84%
because people listening to
this right now-- our audience

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.010 align:middle line:84%
are very proactive and
adventurous, and some of them

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:84%
probably are already looking
up on Travelocity or whatever

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:90%
tickets to Scotland.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we're
going to be talking about

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:90%
more of these sacred sites.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Can people still get to them?

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Like in Sardinia, we
could go right up to them.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:90%
There were no guards.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.243 align:middle line:90%
There were no fences.

00:13:58.243 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Can you get to these places?

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:01.702 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's the one
beautiful thing about Scotland.

00:14:01.702 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Up until the latest mishaps, I
was running a very successful

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle line:90%
trip up there, just six people.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:90%
I think the record's 12 minutes.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:90%
It sold out in 12 minutes.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:84%
We also drink heavily,
but that's another story.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But no,
it's total access.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what I love about
the Scottish landscape.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.957 align:middle line:90%
Even the more commercial ones--

00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ooh, lovely, OK.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --like Callanish,
the one that everybody thinks

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.370 align:middle line:90%
and it's an incredible place.

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.252 align:middle line:84%
I've sometimes been
the only person there.

00:14:26.252 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we can go up and
put our hands on these stones

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:90%
because you--

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:29.385 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: You can touch them.

00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:90%
You can be be up nice--

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyone who's
learned to play a little bit

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.390 align:middle line:84%
with psychometry and such, it's
amazing what these stones will

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:90%
tell you.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And getting them out
of there is a really hard part.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Once you're glued
to the stone, you disappear.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's speaking to you.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: You're gone.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that
was a practical thing.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to know because
people are already thinking,

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.140 align:middle line:90%
I want to go to Scotland.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And there's no
selfie hunters either.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, thank god.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm so tired of that culture.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, there is another
one that I thought

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:84%
was interesting because it seems
to hark to a practice that's

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:84%
still used today, and that
was the Odin stone, where

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:84%
couples would reach through
a hole in the stone.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds to me like a
Scottish handfasting ceremony.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It is.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So tell us about that.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's very romantic.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh my god, I
would love to do that.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, and I was
reading the accounts

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:84%
from the 1700s when
people used to go there

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.120 align:middle line:84%
from all across the island,
the archipelago, essentially.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a drowned
coastline, Orkney.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And they used to go there, and
they would honor each other.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.983 align:middle line:84%
And then the man would put
his hand through the hole--

00:15:26.983 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Through the
hole in the stone.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they used
to do the hand fasting.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.315 align:middle line:84%
And he would get on his
knees and say, my love,

00:15:33.315 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%
I will be with you forever.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I'll provide pigs
and hay and everything.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything you need.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they they'd
go up to the next circle.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And then she would
repeat the vows.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they would come
back and do it a third time.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And then there came a time at
the end of the 19th century

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.210 align:middle line:90%
when there was a local guy who--

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
he was called a ferry
louper, in other words,

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
a who came from the big city
in Scotland and came in,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:90%
pretended to be a bigwig.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And he decided to
look at the stone

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and go, hey, I can make some
nice building material out

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.845 align:middle line:90%
And that was the end of it.

00:16:04.845 --> 00:16:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And reading the account of
people being so depressed

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.020 align:middle line:84%
about this, because it's
a very old tradition.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.187 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it got to the point
where vows were actually

00:16:12.187 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:90%
exchanged as legal documents.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So anybody who broke the
agreement broke the Odin oath.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And they were held accountable
by law, by Scottish law.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, still considered
something very serious today.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.802 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:26.802 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Your word is your bond.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
word is your bond.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And the stone is the
intermediary between the two.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Divorce isn't so easy.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.890 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what
percentage of people

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
get divorced that do
the Scottish hand fast.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, certainly not them.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Someone would have to
be killed, obviously.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.752 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is another one here.

00:16:40.752 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about
one of these stones that

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:84%
served as an
interdimensional portal

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.920 align:middle line:84%
where the people there
would circumambulate.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
see an island that wasn't

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:90%
normally seen to human view.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:84%
So they were seeing
into another dimension.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:90%
Which stone circle was that?

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:90%
And tell us about that.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It was a lone stone.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it was on
the island of Ramsey.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.160 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of islands.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
And it had an old
story that precedes

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:90%
the Scandinavian settlers.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you've got to
read the stories metaphorically

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:90%
as well as practically.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:84%
There's an underlying sort of
story behind the other story.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And the first idea is that when
people went up to the stone,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and they were ritually
prepared, they

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:84%
were able to see beyond
the physical world,

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
one island where the gods
came from, a sunken land.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard this before
all around the world.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.057 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
they're telling you

00:17:31.057 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:90%
where these things came from.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.122 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
places, a lot of sea

00:17:34.122 --> 00:17:36.770 align:middle line:84%
mounts around the
Hebrides, around the Orkney

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:84%
which would have been just
above sea level, which

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.213 align:middle line:84%
would have been the extreme
portions of where Atlantis

00:17:42.213 --> 00:17:43.880 align:middle line:84%
would have been in
the central Atlantic.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: So there were outposts.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:90%
The sea level was rising.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
People were going where the warm
water was, which was ironically

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.517 align:middle line:90%
was Scotland.

00:17:51.517 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else was freezing,
but they had it well.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying to tell
you that when you connect

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:84%
with this stone in the right
way and right ritual way,

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:84%
you are able to perceive
the story of the people that

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:84%
brought the stones and the
technology to the islands.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.840 align:middle line:90%
So I see this as a metaphor.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
But also, if you
do it practically,

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.695 align:middle line:84%
because of the metallic
compound of the stone

00:18:10.695 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and where the stone
is placed according

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to the electromagnetic
lines of the Earth's energy

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:84%
which cross at those
stones, if you're

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way compelled,
and if you ritually prepare,

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.467 align:middle line:84%
you can actually go into
that disappearing island.

00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:84%
You're literally going into
the other world to meditate.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.025 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:25.025 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Another dimension.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So it's practical,
mythological at the same time.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And the whole story of
the human remains and DNA

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.572 align:middle line:90%
that's been found pre-flood.

00:18:36.572 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that a little bit.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Pre-deluge, right?

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Deluge.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.003 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's evidence--

00:18:41.003 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I say that.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:90%
I like word, OK?

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It sounds really good.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's some evidence that
area was peopled beforehand.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, they found
some working tools.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So to paint a
picture where we are,

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:84%
we're not just in Scotland,
we're now above Scotland.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.880 align:middle line:84%
We're halfway to Iceland
and also on the way

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:90%
to Shetland Islands as well.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing a deep
sea dredging operation.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And there they brought
up all kinds of things

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:90%
from the seabed.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And among them were
a bunch of artifacts,

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:84%
which were made by
human hands, which

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.650 align:middle line:90%
had been there since 11,000 BC.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So before the
Younger Dryas began,

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.120 align:middle line:84%
people were already
calling this place home,

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:90%
which I found extraordinary.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So it must have
been a lot warmer

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:90%
before the Ice Age kicked in.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And also the land
masses, of course,

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:29.765 align:middle line:84%
were much bigger and supporting
a sizable amount of people.

00:19:29.765 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now what
about the comet stone?

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I like this story.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: [CHUCKLES]

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This nocturnal
meeting place for giants?

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.885 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, first of
all, where's that located?

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.927 align:middle line:90%
We're still in Orkney?

00:19:40.927 --> 00:19:41.727 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:19:41.727 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:90%
We're still in Orkney.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So there are three main
circles, and you're

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.028 align:middle line:90%
going up this isthmus.

00:19:46.028 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a
Peninsula, because now

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:90%
a drowned coastline.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And that you have the
watch stone, which

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
is one of a pair
of two which formed

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.523 align:middle line:90%
the gateway to the next ridge.

00:19:54.523 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the comet stone,

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.145 align:middle line:84%
which is like a preparatory
stone before you.

00:19:58.145 --> 00:20:00.075 align:middle line:84%
You ritually prepare
yourself before you

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:90%
walk into the temple.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.825 align:middle line:84%
You've got to leave your
garbage at the door.

00:20:02.825 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So you can't take your
problems in there.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.420 align:middle line:84%
You can't worry about
bills and someone's

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
stolen your chariot
and all of that

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:84%
because that's going to degrade
the energy of the temple.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:90%
The temple is perfect.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the embodiment of an
invisible force or a God,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:90%
as they called it back then.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:90%
So that's a preparation place.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea why they
call it the comet stone.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:84%
It was just one of those
names that gets dished out

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:24.430 align:middle line:90%
by archaeologists.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:90%
But it's a preparatory place.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's also part of
a ceremonial route that

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:84%
goes to Brodgar, to the
ring of Brodgar which still

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:90%
has most of its stones upright.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's one of the--

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
third largest stone

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:84%
circle in the British
Isles after Avebury.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And it precedes Avebury
by at least 3,000 years.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.603 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's huge.

00:20:44.603 --> 00:20:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And that's pretty big.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's got a
village and and a pub.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.516 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:47.516 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.778 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: So it's very useful.

00:20:48.778 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing is Brodgar
is an incredible place, still

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:90%
very intact.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:84%
You've got a beautiful
360-degree view

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.958 align:middle line:90%
of the entire landscape.

00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And hardly any one's
done any work on there

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:90%
in terms of archaeology.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
British army used it

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.217 align:middle line:84%
for tank maneuvers and practice
in going into the ditch.

00:21:05.217 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
that's always so sad.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so what's
this story about the fiddler

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:90%
and the giants?

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And the giants turned to stone
when the fiddlers stopped.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And what is that a metaphor for?

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
What was that
sharing with humanity

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:90%
at the time, below this?

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And you find
these stories linking

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:90%
giants and the stone circles.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And the giants get turned
to stone all the way up

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.245 align:middle line:84%
from Brittany, all the
way up to Scotland.

00:21:26.245 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
hear this one.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:90%
I like the story of the fiddler.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.505 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So, yeah,
the place apparently

00:21:30.505 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
was put together by giant
or extremely tall people.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.610 align:middle line:84%
It depends on your
point of view.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said that the giants
loved going there to dance.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And one night, the fiddler
decided to strike up

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:90%
a tune that was very lusty.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So the giants knew that
they had to go back

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:90%
into their original places.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they had
to go back home.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they get
turned to stone.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:84%
But the fiddler just kept
going and going and going.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.800 align:middle line:84%
The giants were cutting
the rug really well.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And before you
know it, sun is up.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And they go, ah,
shouldn't be here.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Bump.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.890 align:middle line:90%
And they get turned to stone.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.547 align:middle line:84%
And the idea behind
the story is A,

00:22:03.547 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:84%
it tells you that
the people who built

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:84%
the place which much taller
than the local population.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And then also the
fact that if you

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:84%
lose track of the
connection between the stone

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.770 align:middle line:84%
circle and its relationship
to the landscape and the sky,

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
you begin to lose track
of what nature's supposed

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.025 align:middle line:90%
to be doing around you.

00:22:20.025 --> 00:22:22.560 align:middle line:84%
You lose that connection
to the natural world.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole
tribe also falls apart

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:84%
because the tribe is dependent
to some degree on what

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:84%
happens inside the stone circle,
which is like a mediating

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.690 align:middle line:84%
environment between
worlds, a cross between you

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:34.583 align:middle line:90%
and the other world.

00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:10%
So that's what the
place is trying

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:10%
to tell you that if you
fail to pay attention

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.532 align:middle line:10%
to the rhythm of the stone
circle and what it's there for,

00:22:42.532 --> 00:22:44.490 align:middle line:10%
then you lose track of
the rhythm of the lands.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.823 align:middle line:90%
And then everything falls apart.

00:22:45.823 --> 00:22:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you
end up like us today,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.790 align:middle line:84%
totally disconnected, coming
home from the bar at dawn,

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:90%
totally lost, right?

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, OK,
thank you for that.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:55.560 align:middle line:90%
I love that story.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And the Tuath Dé Danann
start coming into the story.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And I am more familiar with
the Tuath Dé Danann from

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:84%
a trajectory of Atlantis
and then in to Scotland,

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately leading
into the Druids.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So you're coming at it
slightly differently.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the Tuath
Dé Danann and who they were.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Ooh, a 12,000-year
story in 10 seconds.

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:90%
No, I'll give you a minute.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.615 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You got to
go back all the way

00:23:21.615 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:90%
to the Armenian Highlands.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
You've got to look
at the trajectory

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:90%
of the word and the name.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.920 align:middle line:84%
The people of Anu,
or the Anunnaki,

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:84%
as they were back
then, they originated

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:90%
in the Armenian Highlands.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.707 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
description of the Book

00:23:33.707 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:84%
of Enoch and the
geographical area

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
seems to match exactly
what's going on in Armenia.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And I got hold of some
people in Armenia who

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
were high in scholars who were
more than happy to tell me

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.210 align:middle line:84%
the story because they're saying
nobody ever asked us the story.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.790 align:middle line:84%
We have this story from
where it all began.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wait a minute, is
this like the dad in "My Big Fat

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Greek Wedding?"

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a Greek.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Everything come from Greece.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Not this time.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Sorry, Greeks.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So there I traced
the people from there

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.988 align:middle line:84%
and they had exactly
the same mannerisms

00:24:05.988 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:84%
that we find in
Ireland and Scotland.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.440 align:middle line:84%
They had the same genetic
makeup, the same very tall,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:90%
light skinned.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:90%
They're blond, blue-eyed.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:84%
They're red-haired
and green-eyed.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking we're talking
about the same people here.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:23.370 align:middle line:84%
The concept of the Tuath Dé
Danann were part of the tribe

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.070 align:middle line:84%
of Dan is a complete
invention, OK?

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Complete invention
by the church.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And then it snowballed
out of the way

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of political reasons,
which will take us forever

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.330 align:middle line:90%
to discuss.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But the people of Anu
literally were honoring

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:90%
the goddess of the sky.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:84%
It's is a kind of
an androgynous God.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes he's masculine.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes he's feminine.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So, as these people
move after the flood

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and they begin to meander around
the Black Sea and the Caspian

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Sea into Ukraine and Siberia,
after about 3,000 years,

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.200 align:middle line:84%
they take on the form of
the Scythian culture, which

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:84%
is a big, big area that goes
all the way to Mongolia and all

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:84%
the way to Bulgaria and
takes over northern Greece

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.890 align:middle line:90%
and part of Asia Minor.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:90%
So they were a huge culture.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, here they've
changed their name.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.070 align:middle line:84%
They become part of
the Tuath Dé Danu.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Same people, but
they're still part

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.180 align:middle line:90%
of the royal house of Scythia.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And they gave the name
to the famous river

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.410 align:middle line:84%
that goes through that
area, which is the Danube.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's where it gets
very complicated because they

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:90%
split at this point.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.990 align:middle line:84%
One group goes south
into the Mediterranean.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.050 align:middle line:84%
They're mostly red-haired,
the red haired people.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:90%
Still light skinned, very tall.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.290 align:middle line:84%
They eventually make
their way to Malta

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:84%
where we find a lot of them
buried, and then to Sardinia

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.350 align:middle line:90%
where they took their language.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's where
we find the root of the word

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.770 align:middle line:84%
nuraghe and also
the word Sardinia.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So it comes from Sardi, which
is the goddess of the moon

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.570 align:middle line:90%
in the Armenian pantheon.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So she's the bride of
the God of the sun.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So Sardi literally
is an Armenian word.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And then the eventually they go
around the Portugal to Iberia.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:84%
They became the Basques
people, which the Armenians

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.728 align:middle line:90%
are very open about.

00:25:57.728 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:84%
65% of Basques language,
which is Armenian.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's a language--

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, exactly,
very hard language.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.033 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: They go to Wales.

00:26:03.033 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
They form Cymru,
which is Wales--

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
still exists in Armenia
to this very day.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And eventually they end up in
Ireland as the Tuath Dé Danann.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.347 align:middle line:84%
The other group goes
north through Denmark

00:26:12.347 --> 00:26:14.430 align:middle line:84%
all the way to Scandinavia,
all the way to Norway,

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and then Orkney
and penses around

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.750 align:middle line:90%
to meet them in Ireland as well.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So we had this heart-shaped
movement of people over--

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and you
have this in your book.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --7000 years?

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you have these
migration paths in your book.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.975 align:middle line:84%
And I said Scotland earlier,
meaning to say Ireland

00:26:27.975 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and the Tuath Dé Danann,
Ireland and the Druids.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.277 align:middle line:84%
And so, OK, so now these
are the same people.

00:26:33.277 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:84%
We keep talking about
the same people.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.315 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're
the same people.

00:26:35.315 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.797 align:middle line:84%
And they have the
same mannerisms,

00:26:36.797 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
the same construction
techniques, the same mythology.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.313 align:middle line:90%
Everything tracks very well.

00:26:40.313 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it connects
also to the people of Atlantis.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.188 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just going to
say that because the ones who

00:26:45.188 --> 00:26:48.010 align:middle line:84%
were in the temples were
known during certain stages

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantean history
to be very, very tall.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're also described
by the same sort of eponym,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.080 align:middle line:90%
which was the shining people.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The shining people.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because A, they
were much more intellectual,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.335 align:middle line:84%
so they gave them
a certain glow.

00:27:00.335 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a metaphor.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:84%
But because they also had to
put a certain oil on their skin

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:84%
because they were
sensitive to the sunlight.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.000 align:middle line:90%
It gave the skin a certain glow.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the terminology
the shining people comes from.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.090 align:middle line:90%
So it fulfills two functions.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a physical
description and it's

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:84%
a metaphor of what
they represent,

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.280 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom that it represents.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And the Anu were
the original people

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
of the serpent in
Armenia and in Atlantis.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:26.570 align:middle line:84%
It was the Offiusa who ended
up in Portugal, ironically,

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:27.370 align:middle line:90%
exactly--

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.912 align:middle line:84%
and I mean exactly the base of
the mountain where I was born,

00:27:29.912 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:90%
which is very strange.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was blond when I
was growing up, young.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm saying I'm one
of them, but any other group--

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
you're tall enough.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.687 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you sweat, you shine.

00:27:39.687 --> 00:27:42.132 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: [LAUGHS] Makeup.

00:27:42.132 --> 00:27:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And the other group
end up in the Yucatan

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:84%
as the people of the
serpent, the Kanuul,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
so that they start
dynasty there.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what connects all
these people all together.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:90%
So they didn't die out.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All of this offshoots
from Atlantean culture.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They're all
connected to the same thing.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.488 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
are also known,

00:27:56.488 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and in hermetic and other terms,
as the followers of Horus.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The [NON-ENGLISH],, the
shining ones follow the Horus.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's where there's an
Armenian connection there

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's one point the two
countries were intermarrying

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.310 align:middle line:84%
to continue that
divine bloodline.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
you get to 1300 BC,

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:84%
we have a very famous
woman who everybody

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:90%
knows, Nefertiti, who people--

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:84%
even George Petrie,
the archaeologist,

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.852 align:middle line:84%
he said, she doesn't
look Egyptian, does she?

00:28:23.852 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at the features.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:90%
She looks very, very Caucasian.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're on the
hunt for her right now.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, goody.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, this is the big
deal in archaeology right now.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I've been reading
about it in Egyptology,

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:90%
is they're on the hunt for her.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And a whole different
stories coming

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.790 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of her being.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to validate this

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:84%
because they're saying she
was co-regent, co-ruler,

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.100 align:middle line:90%
co-pharaoh.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.750 align:middle line:84%
She was not just
a pretty face they

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.170 align:middle line:84%
carved that sat alongside
her husband, Akhenaten.

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:51.910 align:middle line:90%
That she actually was co-ruling.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And some say even
more than that.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:54.190 align:middle line:90%
So what is it?

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.352 align:middle line:84%
You found a term
that indicates that.

00:28:56.352 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: So here's the story.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:90%
If you look at the--

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:84%
there was a letter that
Nefertiti wrote to her father

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:84%
once she got married
to Akhenaten.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And he asked his father--

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:84%
sorry, her father to bring down
the dowry because the thing

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:90%
has been done.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:90%
They dowry has to come down.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And her father rules the
kingdom to the north.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Now at the time,
the only kingdom

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.640 align:middle line:84%
that was connecting to
the north border of Egypt

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.200 align:middle line:90%
was actually Armenia.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's a connection,
but it goes more

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.693 align:middle line:90%
into this because I found out--

00:29:24.693 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I actually had to learn
Armenian to write this book.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those things you
have to do as a researcher.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was fascinating because
Nefertiti is not a name.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.870 align:middle line:90%
It turns out it's a phrase.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So Nefertiti
literally in Armenia

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.607 align:middle line:84%
means she who is the
backbone of the pharaoh--

00:29:40.607 --> 00:29:41.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting--

00:29:41.815 --> 00:29:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --which ties back--

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --because this is--

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --now
that maybe be in--

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.613 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --what's just
starting to come out

00:29:45.613 --> 00:29:49.300 align:middle line:84%
even in I think it was
"National Geographic" I

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.230 align:middle line:90%
read the last story.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.760 align:middle line:90%
So, mainstream stuff.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.010 align:middle line:84%
That kind of blows the whole
story of half brothers.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:90%
And anyway, we won't go there.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So history
changes if that is accurate.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you're talking
about followers of Horus-- and

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:84%
we just mentioned
Nefertiti Akhenaten.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.080 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about these
various sacred sites--

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
you can't ignore the sun,
the central theme of the sun

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:84%
as being a prime
influence in deity--

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --OK, for
the shining ones.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you were
saying in your book

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.020 align:middle line:84%
almost all these
sacred sites are

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
focused on the rising
sun not the setting sun.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.440 align:middle line:84%
There only a few
exceptions to that.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:90%
And so why that?

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, it was
weird because for example,

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.550 align:middle line:84%
one of the main mounds on
Orkney, which is Maeshowe,

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.640 align:middle line:84%
it follows the trajectory
of a setting sun.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, that's unusual
because people in the old world

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:84%
didn't usually celebrate
the setting of things

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.640 align:middle line:84%
because you want
the energy to be up.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:84%
You see the midheaven of
the rising when things

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.032 align:middle line:90%
are on there on the ascendant.

00:30:44.032 --> 00:30:46.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like no one celebrates
an empty glass of scotch.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't happen.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So I figured there's
only two countries

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I know that keep
celebrating the descent--

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Setting sun.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --of celestial
objects and specifically Orion,

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.233 align:middle line:84%
which all of these sites
are associated with.

00:30:56.233 --> 00:30:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And one was the Egyptian
culture and the other

00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:90%
was the Armenian culture.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what began to
open up the whole storyline

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:06.520 align:middle line:84%
of a culture that eventually
came from Armenia that settled

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.260 align:middle line:84%
in the islands of
Scotland and completely

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.427 align:middle line:90%
avoided the rest of Britain.

00:31:09.427 --> 00:31:11.927 align:middle line:84%
It's like there was something
that was happening in Britain.

00:31:11.927 --> 00:31:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was still full of ice,
or something about the living

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.852 align:middle line:90%
conditions weren't quite right.

00:31:15.852 --> 00:31:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But they seem to
circumnavigate around Britain,

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.610 align:middle line:90%
started at the very top.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And they slowly
worked their way south

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.260 align:middle line:84%
along the Hebrides, which
is also an Armenian name,

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually ended up
in Ireland to hang out with

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.537 align:middle line:90%
the Tuath Dé Danann.

00:31:28.537 --> 00:31:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tuath Dé Danann.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.282 align:middle line:84%
OK, oh, goodness, we've
chatted quite a bit.

00:31:33.282 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I haven't
even done a third of script.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to Callanish,
the Callanish people.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Same thing, same story,
Callanish people,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:44.070 align:middle line:84%
same tall people, white
tunics, red hair, et cetera.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about a
counterpart in Armenia you said

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.267 align:middle line:84%
built in almost 23,000
BC let's talk about that.

00:31:52.267 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: There's a--

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't
write the name of the--

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:55.768 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, Carahunge.

00:31:55.768 --> 00:31:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.392 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I hope I'm
pronouncing this right,

00:31:58.392 --> 00:32:00.120 align:middle line:84%
that I don't offend
anybody in Armenia.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Carahunge.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a man I have to give
credit to, Paris Herouni,

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:04.790 align:middle line:90%
the late Paris Herouni.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.145 align:middle line:84%
He's got patents
as long as my leg.

00:32:07.145 --> 00:32:07.945 align:middle line:90%
He's a genius.

00:32:07.945 --> 00:32:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Patents.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Patents.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As we
say, just so people

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.082 align:middle line:90%
know what you're talking about.

00:32:12.082 --> 00:32:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Patents.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.110 align:middle line:90%
It's French-American.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And he took it upon
himself to research one

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.287 align:middle line:84%
of the most famous
sites in Armenia,

00:32:19.287 --> 00:32:20.370 align:middle line:90%
which there's quite a lot.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is called
Carahunge, which literally

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.070 align:middle line:90%
means the sounding stones.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So cara, a stone,
hunge is sound.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.380 align:middle line:84%
It's also the origin
of the word henge.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you talk
about Stonehenge,

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.067 align:middle line:90%
that's also an Armenian phrase.

00:32:35.067 --> 00:32:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at it from the air--

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.108 align:middle line:84%
and I thought I was the first
person to notice this until I

00:32:39.108 --> 00:32:40.910 align:middle line:90%
began to research Paris's work--

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and, I was amazed to
find that from the air,

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at the
original sister of Callanish

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:90%
that was built much earlier.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So I've pegged Callanish
around about 3900

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:56.420 align:middle line:84%
BC, 4,000 BC with
the alignments.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:84%
But Carahunge is
something very different.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:32:59.000 align:middle line:90%
And because of the--

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.333 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you said 23,000.

00:33:00.333 --> 00:33:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: 23,836.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Tuesday, I think it was.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And he was basically
using the holes

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:84%
which are found in many of
the monoliths of Carahunge

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.460 align:middle line:84%
to literally align
specific constellations

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:84%
of specific bright stars,
nine of them specifically.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And at least five of
them were turns out

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.370 align:middle line:90%
to be in Orion as well.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So these people are connected
to the same constellation,

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:90%
undoubtedly.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was the fact, it
was the same round shape

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.520 align:middle line:84%
with the cruciform rose
leading to the center.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a man in the center
just like a Callanish.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And then Paris also said that,
yeah, they were definitely here

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.820 align:middle line:84%
because the alignments match
around about 25,000 BC.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's a recalibration
around 5,000 BC, which is just

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:44.120 align:middle line:84%
about the time when the
stone circle started

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.590 align:middle line:84%
appearing in the Hebrides
in Britain as well.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So there was a time
coordination here as well.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these
cultures-- all of this

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.640 align:middle line:84%
is oriented toward
Orion, as you just said.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we hear about Orion,
in a lot of different shows

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.590 align:middle line:84%
that are featured
here and elsewhere,

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.690 align:middle line:84%
we automatically
think reptilians.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And we think what's going
on with this orient--

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.960 align:middle line:84%
or the shining ones having
this orientation toward what

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.273 align:middle line:90%
are perceived as reptilians?

00:34:07.273 --> 00:34:08.690 align:middle line:84%
You have a different
take on this.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Please share.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, it just
goes back to how

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.112 align:middle line:84%
they're describing the origin
of the word reptilian is.

00:34:14.112 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It really is to do with
a misperception of what

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.070 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you go back to
the original book of Enoch

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and you talk about the
people at the Garden of Eden,

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
woman Taba'et, who

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.670 align:middle line:90%
is married to Enki, his wife.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:27.530 align:middle line:90%
She is the gardener.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:90%
She takes care of the garden.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And they address her
as a serpent woman.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.105 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
story went this way.

00:34:33.105 --> 00:34:35.480 align:middle line:84%
There must have been reptilians
because she was a serpent

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.139 align:middle line:90%
woman.

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:37.681 align:middle line:84%
It just shows a lack
of understanding

00:34:37.681 --> 00:34:39.860 align:middle line:84%
of why these people would
call the serpent people.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Anyone at the time who
understood the laws of nature

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and how to also move them within
the restrictions of the law

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.230 align:middle line:84%
itself were talking about the
laws which are electromagnetic.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
telluric currents

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.770 align:middle line:84%
that flow around the
Earth like serpents.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:84%
You are defined as a
person of the serpent.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So she was one of the people
of the serpent, which was

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:90%
the nickname of the Anunnaki.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But it was also
the same nickname

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.720 align:middle line:84%
of the people of the same
ilk in Central America

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and in Polynesia, in
Central Europe and so forth.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:11.222 align:middle line:90%
So it was a badge of office.

00:35:11.222 --> 00:35:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were
intimately associated

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.370 align:middle line:84%
with the Orion as a place of
origin a long, long time ago.

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And I hear this from people
all around the world.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And I always go
back to the source,

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:90%
which is the Indigenous people.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.090 align:middle line:90%
What do they know?

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Not a white guy
from Europe like me.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.003 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what the
locals say about this.

00:35:27.003 --> 00:35:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, also--

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I've been
compiling this stuff.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.727 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in
some cave arts, you

00:35:29.727 --> 00:35:33.210 align:middle line:84%
do see reptilians sort of
features on some of-- even

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.670 align:middle line:90%
in some of the Sumerian art.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So what is the nature of
these people, regardless

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.133 align:middle line:84%
of what their anatomy
may look like?

00:35:39.133 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And I
think that that's--

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you think
they were once upon a time?

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Humans were very
comfortable with them.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.150 align:middle line:84%
If they weren't
comfortable with them,

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:49.010 align:middle line:84%
they would have said something
like we're afraid of them.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:50.677 align:middle line:84%
They want to hang out
with these people.

00:35:50.677 --> 00:35:52.410 align:middle line:84%
They look weird
compared to humans.

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you think
they were more humanoid.

00:35:53.405 --> 00:35:55.113 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They were
very, very comfortable

00:35:55.113 --> 00:35:57.420 align:middle line:84%
with them, which tells
me they were like us.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:84%
They seemed to be very
Nordic type, because when

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.795 align:middle line:84%
you go to Polynesia
and they talk

00:36:00.795 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:84%
about light-skinned
people who are

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:84%
very tall with blond
haired, blue eyes.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they mistook
Captain Cook as a returning

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:10.560 align:middle line:90%
god when he came to Hawaii.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:84%
They welcomed him with
open arms because they

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.260 align:middle line:84%
thought they was one of the
original gods that settled them

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.200 align:middle line:90%
in Hawaii.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.452 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me that
these people were humanoid.

00:36:18.452 --> 00:36:20.660 align:middle line:84%
They were just-- in fact,
there was one great phrase.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember which
guy who told me this.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.400 align:middle line:84%
They said they're human-like,
but not quite human.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So they were definitely
much taller than we were.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And they had this-- again, this
problem with their skin being

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.102 align:middle line:84%
very, very light that needed
to have constant sort of--

00:36:32.102 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sunblock.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --sunblock on them.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So it tells me that this was
definitely a humanoid culture.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, were there
experiments that were

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:45.320 align:middle line:84%
done mixing things with
reptiles and donkeys and humans?

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:84%
There is a sort of a
hint in the Book of Enoch

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.600 align:middle line:84%
that there was a small group
of troublemakers, what they

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.088 align:middle line:90%
called the bastard watchers.

00:36:52.088 --> 00:36:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them,
because the watchers

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:54.988 align:middle line:90%
were the intermediaries.

00:36:54.988 --> 00:36:56.780 align:middle line:84%
They were the messengers
between the people

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.580 align:middle line:90%
of Anu and human beings.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Their charge was just tell
people, give the humans

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.950 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of hint of
knowledge and then come back.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Don't mix it with them.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:84%
They need to have their
own self-determination.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.212 align:middle line:84%
And for reasons
we don't know yet,

00:37:09.212 --> 00:37:11.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a small group of
them that defied the orders,

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and then they started doing
some very stupid things

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.508 align:middle line:84%
with experimentation
with hybrids.

00:37:15.508 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where the whole
concept of the whole reptilian

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.890 align:middle line:90%
thing comes from.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:20.640 align:middle line:84%
There are some really
stupid experiments.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you read the
original book of Enoch,

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.380 align:middle line:84%
it's a highly suggestive
there that there

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:84%
were silly experiments
going on that

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.110 align:middle line:84%
were taught to hunter-gatherers,
including warfare,

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.860 align:middle line:84%
how to make metallurgy, and
create swords and other things

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.880 align:middle line:90%
to kill each other with.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.850 align:middle line:84%
That's where the whole
story gets completely AWOL.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the lords
of Anu and the watchers

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:41.690 align:middle line:84%
get together and
say, well, we need

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.273 align:middle line:84%
to help the humans
because they're not

00:37:43.273 --> 00:37:46.850 align:middle line:84%
going to survive because the
offspring of these renegade

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.360 align:middle line:84%
watchers, they're given birth
to truly enormous people.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Now, those are the giants.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.630 align:middle line:84%
They're not just tall,
now they're giantesque,

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.980 align:middle line:90%
covered in red hair.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.273 align:middle line:90%
And that they're running amok.

00:37:56.273 --> 00:37:57.440 align:middle line:90%
They're breeding like crazy.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.127 align:middle line:90%
Unless we instigate a flood--

00:37:59.127 --> 00:38:01.460 align:middle line:84%
we have to wipe everything
from scratch-- humans are not

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:90%
going to have a chance.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
wonderful agonizing moment

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:05.810 align:middle line:90%
in the Book of Enoch--

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.060 align:middle line:90%
all you have to do is read it.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.630 align:middle line:84%
It's right there-- where they're
agonizing about the fact,

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have to kill
everybody, including their own.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Even the gods drowned
during this thing.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And they engineered
this thing and then

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.720 align:middle line:84%
they said, right, the survivors
of the Anu and the watchers

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.300 align:middle line:84%
will be responsible for
going in groups of seven

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:84%
around the world, wherever
they happen to be.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And when they alight on the
shores of the continents,

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.200 align:middle line:90%
they'll restart civilization.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.130 align:middle line:84%
They will teach human hunter
gatherers how to do what we do.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly, in 8500
BC humans magically

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:40.920 align:middle line:84%
discovered animal husbandry and
how to grow crops and so forth.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So there is a pattern
building here.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
seeded all around.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it was seeded
all around the world.

00:38:45.545 --> 00:38:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing that, Freddy.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
lot of time left--

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Rehabilitating the
Anunnaki and the watchers.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, thank you.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The story is much
greyer than we imagined.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Greyer.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:56.480 align:middle line:90%
No pun intended.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No pun intended.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:58.910 align:middle line:90%
So, Iona.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's go now to-- because
we've been mostly in Orkney.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.590 align:middle line:90%
But let's go to Iona.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know
because personally

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:90%
because I'm going to Iona.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
check it out because I

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:84%
was very curious about
some things there.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about there's
an abbey and then a smaller

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.300 align:middle line:90%
building next to the abbey.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.940 align:middle line:90%
But 50-50.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Now what's up with this?

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:24.530 align:middle line:84%
50 kings from Britain
are buried in this Abbey.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.490 align:middle line:90%
So the Iona's one mile by three.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's like--

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:90%
I think it's like 4 by 2.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's a tiny, tiny rock.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very small.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So you have the Alba
kings and queens buried there,

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.110 align:middle line:90%
kings and queens from Britain.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.800 align:middle line:84%
You have some of the
French buried there.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that was shocking.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.077 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: A British
Prime Minister,

00:39:40.077 --> 00:39:41.253 align:middle line:90%
who was actually a nice guy.

00:39:41.253 --> 00:39:42.920 align:middle line:84%
He didn't last very
long, unfortunately.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.000 align:middle line:90%
He died of natural causes.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
as well, Macbeth.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.802 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:45.802 --> 00:39:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:47.815 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So what is
it with this place?

00:39:47.815 --> 00:39:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can't wait to go.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: That's what
I wanted to know.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So, Iona comes from
an Armenian phrase.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.050 align:middle line:90%
It's [NON-ENGLISH].

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.945 align:middle line:84%
And it means the circle
of the people of Armenia.

00:39:57.945 --> 00:39:58.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But because the
people of Armenia,

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:04.490 align:middle line:84%
high is also a contraction
of the word Orion.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:08.630 align:middle line:84%
The people of Armenia identify
themselves as being of Orion.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Not physically, but
intimately connected

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.760 align:middle line:84%
with the constellation in some
way I haven't quite understood.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So Iona literally
is a meeting place,

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.200 align:middle line:84%
a gathering place of
distinguished people

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:90%
from Armenia.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was a stone
circle of 360 stones where

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:84%
the current Abbey used to sit,
right until the Middle Ages

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.640 align:middle line:84%
when the stoves were discarded
or re carved into the crosses

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.750 align:middle line:90%
that we see today.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.390 align:middle line:84%
But the most important part is
the little building next to it.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And people kind of poke
their head in there

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and they go oh,
nothing much in here,

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.480 align:middle line:84%
take a picture after they go,
the most important building

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.650 align:middle line:84%
because it comes with a
very long story of when

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:45.530 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful gentleman that
comes to the island and begins

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.150 align:middle line:84%
to kick out the
Druids and the women

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.650 align:middle line:90%
off the island, a lovely man.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And but his sidekick Odhran,
he looked at the stories

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.460 align:middle line:90%
about this building.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And he heard that there
was a famous thing where

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the walls came down as quickly
as they went up as though

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.075 align:middle line:90%
by an evil intent.

00:41:00.075 --> 00:41:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And only when the
person had themselves

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.100 align:middle line:84%
buried alive would
the stones stay put.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I read the metaphor
in this and I go,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
they're describing here.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, he has himself
buried alive.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.450 align:middle line:90%
I'll give him credit for this.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And three days later,
they dug him up.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And he wakes up and he says,
all that's been said about hell

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:17.360 align:middle line:90%
is a complete joke.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
this is interesting.

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So he
actually experienced

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:20.840 align:middle line:84%
going into the other
world and coming

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.310 align:middle line:84%
back three days
later because that

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:25.100 align:middle line:84%
was the place of initiation
for a group of monks called

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.900 align:middle line:84%
the Kaldi, which mysteriously
appear on Iona three years

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.823 align:middle line:84%
after the Essenes in Palestine
vanished and went AWOL.

00:41:33.823 --> 00:41:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And they behaved
like the Essenes.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.470 align:middle line:84%
They have the same mannerisms,
same dress code in white tunics

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.080 align:middle line:84%
just like the builders of
the stone circles in Orkney.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And they also are
the same people

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.520 align:middle line:84%
who are associated with the
Druids who actually were

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.590 align:middle line:84%
the people who were
looking after the island

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and taking care of it from a
previous group of people who

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:52.790 align:middle line:90%
were dressing in white robes.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.290 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
original name of Iona

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:57.352 align:middle line:84%
was Innis Druinich, the island
of the magicians or the seers.

00:41:57.352 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:84%
That's where the Druids
used to hang out.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.713 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it must have some
solaric importance as well.

00:42:02.713 --> 00:42:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very much so.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:05.213 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
what's going on there

00:42:05.213 --> 00:42:07.850 align:middle line:84%
so we know what to look
for or what to feel for?

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, Oran's Chapel
is where the things cross.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.578 align:middle line:84%
But even so it's not
the most important part.

00:42:12.578 --> 00:42:14.870 align:middle line:84%
The most important part of
the island is a place called

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.230 align:middle line:84%
the Hill of Angels,
or Síthean Mór,

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.030 align:middle line:90%
the Hill of the Fairy people.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it goes back
to the idea that these are

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.050 align:middle line:90%
the Tuath Dé Danann.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.020 align:middle line:84%
The Tuath Dé Danu and the
Anunnaki were fair skinned.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.540 align:middle line:84%
They were called the fair
folk because they were fair.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They were debonair,
elegant, tall and slim.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.100 align:middle line:90%
And they had this light skin.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:34.580 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Elfin.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: And very elfin.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.205 align:middle line:84%
So when the Catholic Church
shows up in Ireland and finds

00:42:40.205 --> 00:42:42.395 align:middle line:84%
the Tuath Dé Danann
there, they say ah,

00:42:42.395 --> 00:42:44.270 align:middle line:84%
this is not good because
they're still loved.

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:46.700 align:middle line:84%
We want them to love us, the
people who should love us.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As the intermediaries
between the people and God.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And back
then, the Irish people

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.220 align:middle line:84%
are saying no, no,
we like the gods.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.250 align:middle line:90%
They're great people.

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And they call them the fair
people, or the fair folk.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Church in order to
miniaturize the importance,

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.630 align:middle line:84%
that's why the Danann referred
to them as fairy folk who

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.460 align:middle line:84%
are miniature people
with little wings.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And they inhabit
the little mounds.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was great
in terms of politics

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.310 align:middle line:84%
because you basically
brought down

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.299 align:middle line:84%
the stature of a very
important group of people

00:43:12.299 --> 00:43:14.757 align:middle line:84%
in a divine bloodline, which
is the whole purpose for being

00:43:14.757 --> 00:43:14.850 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You miniaturize them.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:17.198 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: You miniaturize them.

00:43:17.198 --> 00:43:18.740 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
though, you've just

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.080 align:middle line:84%
given away what the mounds
were for because those

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.600 align:middle line:84%
are the places where the
fairy world does exist.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.132 align:middle line:84%
Ask any Irish
person or any person

00:43:26.132 --> 00:43:27.590 align:middle line:84%
around the world
who is Indigenous.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's also what the Tuath
Dé Danann were working with.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:33.650 align:middle line:84%
They were working with an
occult sort of across the--

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With the
elemental kingdom.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.757 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --other world with
the elemental kingdom in order

00:43:36.757 --> 00:43:38.660 align:middle line:84%
to do what they did
best, which is to live

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.020 align:middle line:90%
in two worlds at the same time.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.480 align:middle line:90%
So the shamanic process.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So in order to cover
up your tracks,

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.970 align:middle line:84%
you just let the
cat out of the bag.

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So the fairy folk
are absolutely real.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
thank you so much.

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:49.850 align:middle line:90%
This has been a romp.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you give us any
kind of final thoughts

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.245 align:middle line:84%
on this connection you'd
like before we sign off.

00:43:55.245 --> 00:43:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I mean, the big story
about Scotland is the fact

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that A, the stone circles of
Orkney and the Hebrides precede

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Britain.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:03.470 align:middle line:90%
So that was a huge surprise.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Two, the names of
the sites themselves

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:08.150 align:middle line:84%
have either an Armenian
or an Egyptian origin

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and they describe exactly
what the place actually does.

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:13.640 align:middle line:90%
That was mind blowing.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the fact that you
trace these cultures that

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.490 align:middle line:84%
seem to have come from
Sardinia and Armenia

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.920 align:middle line:84%
by shear force of climatic
change by the way,

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.650 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking around
6,000 BC conditions in Europe

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:26.780 align:middle line:90%
were awful, cause ironically.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening
in North America,

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.980 align:middle line:84%
the collapse of the
Laurentide Ice Shelf

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:34.490 align:middle line:84%
had huge climatic repercussions
for Neolithic people in Europe.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
ones by force ended up

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.558 align:middle line:84%
creating this incredible culture
at the very end of the world.

00:44:40.558 --> 00:44:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you wonder why
would they go there?

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.780 align:middle line:10%
This is really quite a hideous
place in terms of whether.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.910 align:middle line:84%
What would drive
people to go there?

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:48.900 align:middle line:84%
That was why, it
was the weather.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it comes down to
something that's simple,

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:52.670 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Mostly, most of the time.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.415 align:middle line:84%
Freddy, thank you again
for all your research.

00:44:55.415 --> 00:44:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: My pleasure.

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.063 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you for
starting this in Sardinia,

00:44:58.063 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:90%
putting these pieces together.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage anyone that
hasn't seen our Sardinia

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.550 align:middle line:84%
romp to take a look at those
three parts, quite fascinating.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:06.032 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't get
to all of this,

00:45:06.032 --> 00:45:07.490 align:middle line:84%
but there are other
structures that

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.040 align:middle line:84%
were very similar as well that
you discovered in Scotland.

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.080 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Always.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to
check some of it out myself.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, Freddy's new book is
titled "Scotland's Hidden

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Sacred Past."

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:21.050 align:middle line:10%
You can pick it up
at major booksellers.

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:23.390 align:middle line:10%
