>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of
the newer faces on Gaia

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:10%
is that of Theresa Bullard, the
host of "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.700 align:middle line:84%
This show is rich with
spiritual and scientific themes

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:84%
that blend together with
beautiful imagery to support it

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:84%
and really kind of drive it home
in a very easy to digest way.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Theresa.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.308 align:middle line:90%
>>THERESA BULLARD: Thank you.

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:84%
It's such a pleasure
to be here again.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.842 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the
things I wanted to do,

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Theresa, is-- yes, you do a
beautiful job articulating

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.170 align:middle line:90%
these themes.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.877 align:middle line:84%
But I want to know
about you personally.

00:00:45.877 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've interviewed
you once before.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
But we really more got into
the science of the themes

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:84%
that you would be discussing
in your upcoming series, which

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.070 align:middle line:90%
is now a reality.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do
is spend a little time

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
getting to know you so your
audience can get to know you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and my audience can
get to know you.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And then also talking
about what you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:84%
were doing in the
first series and where

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:84%
it's headed in the next
one if that makes sense.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think my first question
would be, were you just a total

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:90%
nerd?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:90%

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: You know, at first.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So how far back
do we want to go?

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we
want to go way back.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Do we
want to go way back?

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I see all the time
the genius in little children.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of showing
you what they came in with

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and what they'd like to
play with and express.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And so as far back as you
can go, as you recall,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:84%
that started giving
indications of the kind of mind

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:90%
you developed.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So I think I was
always a very intuitive child.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:10%
But I did not consider myself
a smart person up until--

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.713 align:middle line:10%
I didn't even think that
I could do math or get As

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:10%
or anything like
that in school up

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.870 align:middle line:10%
until I hit maybe 13 years old.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So up until then,
I was a C student.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I just wasn't sure
I was very smart.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But did you have
a fascination with science

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:90%
or any of these themes?

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.887 align:middle line:84%
Or it hadn't really
showed up yet?

00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I had an
inquisitive mind.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So in elementary
school, I was actually

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:90%
put in a private school.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was a private
Christian school,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.323 align:middle line:84%
only because my
parents felt that I

00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:84%
was a really sensitive
person and needed

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:90%
to be a little more sheltered.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
the only option,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:84%
not that they were
super fundamentalist.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.872 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they know
you were intuitive?

00:02:26.872 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And did they know
these abilities?

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So my parents were
into the Edgar Cayce studies.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: So they had a sense.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:90%
And I was their first.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So they put me in
this Christian school.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And I remember we'd be getting
taught the Bible stuff.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.432 align:middle line:84%
And there would be parts
along the way where as a kid

00:02:43.432 --> 00:02:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I'd ask, well, where
do the dinosaurs fit

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:84%
into the Bible,
things like this.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And it became very clear
that I couldn't ask questions

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So I very quickly got skeptical
about just religious approach.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I think I had that
inquisitiveness around science.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.810 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't until--

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't going to
be fostered in that environment

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: No.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And then as I got into
the public schools,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I remember there was one
year where I was really just

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.430 align:middle line:90%
into trying to fit in.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.230 align:middle line:90%
I was very shy.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:90%
I was a very, very shy person.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to just fit
in and get along with my peers

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And there was this one
year in junior high

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:84%
where I had a big falling
out with my peers.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened?

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Tell us.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Oh my god.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:90%
It was total drama, right?

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.477 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these are those
embarrassing little moments.

00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
things that shape us,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:90%
these little moments of trauma.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.145 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: That was a moment
that shaped me, I would say.

00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So I had who I considered
my best friend.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:90%
There was a group of four girls.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And we were all 12, 13.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.713 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Vicious age
for girls, by the way.

00:03:48.713 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And there was one who I
considered my best friend.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:90%
And then she had a boyfriend.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And her boyfriend and
I were friends, too.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:90%
And they both called me.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And they both complained
about each other.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of in the
middle of this, right?

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was always just
being their friend,

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:84%
trying to help them
kind of work it out.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
the girl got jealous.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And then she started accusing
me of all kinds of stuff.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:90%
And then she got really vicious.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.995 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
There was one time where we had
a sleepover at another friend's

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:90%
house for a birthday party.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And they sprayed
shaving cream in my face

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.155 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff.

00:04:27.155 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:90%
And I had to leave.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mean girl face.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.317 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:30.317 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we got busted one time
for sneaking out late at night

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:90%
when we were having a sleepover.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And we got picked
up by the police

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:90%
because we were joy riding.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So I had my little
bit of rebelliousness,

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't really
a rebellious kid.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.892 align:middle line:84%
But I fell into the
peer pressure of it.

00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And then we got caught.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So that night that we
got caught by the police

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:84%
with joyriding late at night,
we were in Newport Beach.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And he's got his driver's
permit, but not a license.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:90%
And he snuck his dad's car out.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.150 align:middle line:90%
And we're driving.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.432 align:middle line:84%
And he's going like
60-something in a 35 zone

00:05:05.432 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:84%
because there's
nobody on the road.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:90%
It was like 3:00 in the morning.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's kind of what

00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:90%
boys with learner's permits do.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.577 align:middle line:84%
And we were listening to
Eddie Murphy live on tape.

00:05:16.577 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:90%
And we were just laughing.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:90%
And he was not paying attention.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you
know, we're getting

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.518 align:middle line:90%
pulled over by a police officer.

00:05:21.518 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:90%
And we all got hauled in.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
you're all underage.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.463 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: We were all underage.

00:05:24.463 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And we all lied by
our age by one year.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And we got hauled into
the police office.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
My mom and dad get
woken up in the middle

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
of the night with a
phone call saying,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
are you so-and-so,
Therese Bullard's parents?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.040 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was a
prank call it first.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And so then they came
and picked me up.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was pissed because
here we were getting busted.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.053 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't even worth it.

00:05:50.053 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:84%
We were supposed to
be going to a party.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And there was no party
by the time we got there.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.862 align:middle line:84%
And it was completely
not worth it.

00:05:54.862 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I didn't
want to go out.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
But I fell into
the peer pressure.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So that was a big turning point
for me because I got grounded,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And my parents said,
well, you're going

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:90%
to be grounded for a month.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have anyone
sleep over for the summer.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I ended up grounding
myself for the summer

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and didn't have anyone
sleep over for a year.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why did you do that?

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Why did you decide to unplug
from this whole peer pressure

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:90%
situation?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I felt like I
had lost my parents' trust

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:90%
in that moment with what I did.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like it
was not worth it.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And these friends were not
a good influence on me,

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt
like I needed to do

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.280 align:middle line:84%
whatever I could to gain my
parents' trust back again.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.447 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's good.

00:06:33.447 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:90%
So it took you, I assume--

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
now, this is paralleling
with the time

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
when you started understanding
that maybe you had a brain.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, at this time, I then
became a loner the next year

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.900 align:middle line:84%
of school because all my
friends went on to high school.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:90%
And I was still in junior high.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:90%
And I had grounded myself.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So I really didn't
have a whole lot

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:90%
to do other than do my homework.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm doing my homework.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.835 align:middle line:84%
And then I started getting
straight As all of a sudden.

00:07:02.835 --> 00:07:05.085 align:middle line:84%
I went from being a C student
to a straight-A student.

00:07:05.085 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a
little application here.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Wow, I can do this.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I can do this, then
I got to keep doing this.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept pushing myself
to not accept anything less.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So isn't it amazing?

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like to
hear about people's

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:84%
traumatic turning-point
moments in life

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
because that's what catapults
us into the next phase.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And for you, something
so simple as wanting

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:84%
to regain your
parents' trust set you

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:84%
on an amazing path of
really intellectual inquiry

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and then spiritual
inquiry as well, right?

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So now you're
getting straight As.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And you're starting to gravitate
towards certain subjects,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:90%
I would assume.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
you really started finding

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:90%
deep-dive interest in early on.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Early on,
I wasn't really sure

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:90%
what I wanted to do.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
It took a while for
me to figure that out.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think I just liked a
lot of different subjects.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:90%
I did get into writing.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lot of great English
teachers through high school.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And they always
encouraged me and gave me

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.812 align:middle line:90%
really positive feedback.

00:08:10.812 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, I wasn't really sure
if it was all that great.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But they were giving me
lots of positive feedback.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And then there was one year I
focused on sports, actually,

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:90%
sports and academia.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Just let me get my good grades.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And let me get a scholarship
into college with sports.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.837 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're still
very athletic in martial arts,

00:08:29.837 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:90%
right, among other things?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I am athletic
still, not as much

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.208 align:middle line:84%
as I used to be because
I have more my mission

00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and my passion now that's
taken up all that time.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.649 align:middle line:90%
But I still try.

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:38.607 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that's in.

00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And so I was
very focused on trying

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to get a scholarship
because I really

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:90%
wanted to go out of state.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:90%
I lived in Southern California.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.048 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get out of
Southern California.

00:08:47.048 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew I needed
to get a scholarship

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:90%
to go to college out of state.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I was focused
on volleyball.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And then one year,
I was exploring my--

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it was my
junior year summer

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:90%
right before my senior year.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.052 align:middle line:84%
And I went to
Sedona with my mom.

00:09:04.052 --> 00:09:05.010 align:middle line:90%
We went on a road trip.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to
go to check out

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:84%
a couple of the universities
in Arizona and then to Denver.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And we went on
this big road trip.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And we stopped in
Sedona just for fun.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And we had a really nice time.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was very energetic
and spiritual and so forth.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we're driving up
to, I think, Northern Arizona

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:90%
from Sedona.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:90%
And my mom's driving.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.625 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just looking at
the stars as we're driving.

00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's so
beautiful at night in Sedona.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:90%
So quiet and dark.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It's just amazing.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:90%
So amazing.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.370 align:middle line:84%
You could see the
whole Milky Way.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
thinking, what's out there?

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.903 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what's out there.

00:09:39.903 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more
going on in this universe

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.047 align:middle line:84%
than our mundane little
lives on this planet.

00:09:45.047 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:90%
I want to know what's out there.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when I had
this a-ha moment because I

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:84%
was really trying
to think of, well,

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.395 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to major in?

00:09:51.395 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
As you're thinking
about college,

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:90%
they ask you this question.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I
thought, oh, that's it.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do astronomy
or astrophysics.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that then set me on
the path to get into science.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a wonderful story.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Sedona
does that to you.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I lived there for the
better part of 18 years

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.367 align:middle line:90%
until very recently.

00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
greatest pleasures--

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.400 align:middle line:84%
is just pull a chair out
onto the patio or wherever

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:90%
and look at the night sky.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
Pleiades so clearly.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything is so
evident looking at it

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
when you're in an inky
black environment like that.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Now you decide to go into
the arena of astrophysics.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And what really
started catapulting you

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:84%
more into the consciousness
aspect of your work?

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So when I
was in college, again,

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.360 align:middle line:90%
I was playing volleyball.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:90%
I was doing my physics.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I actually ended up going
to University of Denver.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
astrophysics or astronomy

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:90%
as a major.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:90%
So they said, just do physics.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.392 align:middle line:84%
And then you can do it
later in graduate school.

00:10:55.392 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:90%
So I was doing physics.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:90%
And I was doing volleyball.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And on the volleyball work
and the athletic work,

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I almost joined up with somebody
to create a wellness kind

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:84%
of training for athletes
with visualization,

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:84%
using visualization to
improve athletic skill.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was in
my first year there,

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I also had an honors
English class,

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:84%
where we explored the
transcendental poets--

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Wordsworth, Thoreau,
Emerson, William Blake.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful era.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:90%
That woke me up.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I just loved everything
that I read of those.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that was, I would say,
my own first personal spiritual

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:42.042 align:middle line:84%
resonance-- was with the work
of the transcendental poets.

00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And then my mom's
like, well, if you like

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:90%
that, then you might like zen.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you like that,
you might like this.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.352 align:middle line:84%
So she was always
encouraging my exploration.

00:11:49.352 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was already
lit up in that arena.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yes, yes.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.993 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of explored
a little bit on the side.

00:11:55.993 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until I
got into graduate school

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that I really focused
on my spirituality.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And that was because I got
thrown into 80 hours of physics

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:90%
a week.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So I went from having all this
diversity and balance and so

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.627 align:middle line:84%
forth and athletics into
only physics 80 hours a week.

00:12:10.627 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might like my version
of the volleyball version

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
of that, which is I was playing
at Lake Tahoe in mixed league.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And we got stoned
before every game.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking about
consciousness and mind

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:90%
altering.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And we were unbeatable
as long as we

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:84%
were stoned because we
were all in the same mind.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And so finally we made
it all the way through.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Now it's the finals.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:90%
It's literally the finals.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And we decided, maybe we
should get serious about this

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:90%
and not get stoned.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.026 align:middle line:90%
And so we didn't, and we lost.

00:12:42.026 --> 00:12:44.085 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It changed your flow.

00:12:44.085 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It totally
changed our flow.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:84%
We were not tasked
with overworking.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's just put it that way.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But I always did find that
interesting that literally we

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
operated almost as one organism
when we were smoking weed back

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.320 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Interesting.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyway, so you took a
little bit more, shall we say,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:90%
studied approach to it all.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So now you're studying
consciousness.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.350 align:middle line:90%
You're in graduate school.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And you've already been through
the great thinkers and poets

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:84%
of the late 18th
and 19th century.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.310 align:middle line:90%
And so now what?

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So I was
finding myself really

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:90%
out of balance all of a sudden.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And after about a year of my
first year of graduate school,

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.907 align:middle line:90%
I was not happy.

00:13:24.907 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah,
way out of balance.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.615 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, way out
of balance, no right brain

00:13:28.615 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:90%
activity, no athletic time.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just like
grindstone and having

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.385 align:middle line:84%
to jump through the
hoops and prove yourself

00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.635 align:middle line:84%
I was really disenchanted
because I didn't actually

00:13:40.635 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:90%
know what I wanted to do still.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I was just sort of following
the academic model,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:84%
thinking at some
point along the way

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to discover
what I want to do.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I realize,
why am I doing this?

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:84%
It just sent me on
this search of asking,

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.710 align:middle line:90%
what is it that I really want?

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And is this really
the right fit for me?

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And is it worth the
expense of my happiness

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:90%
and sense of well-being?

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And I decided, well, it's not
worth that level of sacrifice.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.398 align:middle line:84%
And so if I'm going
to survive this,

00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I need to find a way to bring
balance and meaning and purpose

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:90%
back in.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:90%
So I started to search.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I had it before.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And now it was missing.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So in my scientific
way of thinking,

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, let's
just systematically bring

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:84%
in what I had before
and see what the key is.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:90%
And so I did that.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:90%
I brought in sports again.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.920 align:middle line:90%
I brought in social time.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:90%
I brought in creative hobbies.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.865 align:middle line:84%
I brought in all
these different things

00:14:32.865 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
that a normal, well-rounded
lifestyle should say,

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.955 align:middle line:90%
this is going to make you happy.

00:14:36.955 --> 00:14:38.080 align:middle line:90%
And I had all those things.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And a year later,
everything was better.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:84%
But I was still
missing that core sense

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:90%
of meaning and purpose.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.325 align:middle line:84%
And then one day
I was at the gym.

00:14:45.325 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking about
it in the back of my mind.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
this light bulb turned on--

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:90%
or this little voice.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:84%
A little voice came
in, actually, and said,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.660 align:middle line:84%
there's still one thing you
haven't brought back in yet.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
well, what is it?

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.620 align:middle line:90%
And then it was spirituality.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.292 align:middle line:84%
And so spirituality
was-- and it was.

00:15:01.292 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It was the only thing I
hadn't brought back in.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But by then, I thought
I didn't need it.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.280 align:middle line:84%
I was really well versed into
the scientific way of thinking.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It was always just kind of
in the background for me.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:90%
Now it was the one thing.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.643 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, OK,
well, I got to try it.

00:15:17.643 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
sent me on the search.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what was
that part of the journey?

00:15:21.435 --> 00:15:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Where did you jump in
on a spiritual level?

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I knew that
at that point, anything

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.400 align:middle line:84%
I was going to believe
spiritually had to complement

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:90%
what I knew scientifically.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't go for blind faith
and just religious approach.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I needed to
find something that was

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:90%
going to mesh with what I knew.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I jumped into the science
and consciousness, science

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, Tao physics,
all these kinds of things.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:90%
It lit me up.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.670 align:middle line:84%
It reminded me, actually,
why I even got into physics.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I realized, oh, what brought me
into physics was synchronicity

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:90%
plus a spiritual inspiration.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:90%
And now, here I am in physics.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I need to remember
why I'm in physics.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was spirituality
that was that key.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And so I got really excited.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:90%
I got really turned on.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.755 align:middle line:84%
And then I wanted
people to share with.

00:16:09.755 --> 00:16:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be able to talk with
other people of the same mind.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
that go for you?

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: It didn't.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.128 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course not.

00:16:15.128 --> 00:16:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: In physics,
it's like, no.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
talk about spirituality

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:84%
or even mention
anything like that,

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:84%
you're going to lose
your credibility.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be ostracized.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So I was really afraid
of talking about it.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And I had already seen
examples of people

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.720 align:middle line:84%
trying to broach
the subject just

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:90%
with the graduate students.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, don't go there.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:90%
So I felt really isolated.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I tried to
search out communities.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:42.715 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I
lived in Seattle.

00:16:42.715 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I was at the University
of Washington.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to
search our community

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:90%
in a more spiritual vein.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't really finding
the depth that I wanted.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And so one day I just
put out, OK, universe,

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to find my
spiritual family.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Help me find my tribe.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Help me find my path.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.363 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to be
there somewhere.

00:17:00.363 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:90%
And I just put it out.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:90%
And I let it go.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.799 align:middle line:84%
And I focused on my graduate
stuff and my testing

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And then about two weeks
later, synchronicity

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:84%
brought me to a woman
named Verla Wade,

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:84%
who lived in Seattle, who was
associated with the Modern

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Mystery School.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And she did something
called DNA activation.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And the whole story
is her webmaster

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:84%
emailed my mom
because my mom had

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.795 align:middle line:90%
a website called DNAmusic.com.

00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:30.350 align:middle line:84%
She was really into the Monroe
Institute's music, med music,

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.370 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.265 align:middle line:84%
And so she had
told her webmaster,

00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:84%
get in touch with this
woman in California who does

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:90%
this DNA-wakening music.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.102 align:middle line:90%
And she found my mom.

00:17:39.102 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't the one
that Verla had originally

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:90%
intended her to find.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And my mom goes and
checks out our website

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.860 align:middle line:84%
to see if she wanted
to cross link or not.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:90%
And she's looking.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.827 align:middle line:90%
She's seeing all this stuff.

00:17:48.827 --> 00:17:50.723 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, hmm,
DNA activation.

00:17:50.723 --> 00:17:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that sounds interesting.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Where is this woman?

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.397 align:middle line:84%
And then she sees
that she's in Seattle.

00:17:54.397 --> 00:17:56.318 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, oh, there
are no coincidences.

00:17:56.318 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Theresa, just two
weeks ago, you were

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.195 align:middle line:84%
thinking you wanted to
find your spiritual family.

00:18:00.195 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:90%
And now there's this.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.065 align:middle line:90%
Go check it out.

00:18:02.065 --> 00:18:03.483 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You had a great mom.

00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:04.400 align:middle line:10%
>>BULLARD: I sure did.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:90%
I sure did.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.650 align:middle line:90%
I was very lucky.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.850 align:middle line:90%
I am very lucky.

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:12.578 align:middle line:84%
She's a wonderful, wonderful
guide and mentor and supporter.

00:18:12.578 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
ended up in Seattle.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So I
ended up in Seattle.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was living in Seattle.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
But through that process, I then
went and got my life activation

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.420 align:middle line:84%
DNA awakening session
done with this person.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And then that opened up the
door to me finding the Mystery

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:90%
School.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And see, at first
I was skeptical

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:84%
because I had tried
a lot of things.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I had been to all the
Body, Mind, Spirit Expos

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.410 align:middle line:90%
while I was searching.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.840 align:middle line:90%
And some of it was great.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:90%
And some of it didn't deliver.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But as a scientist,
I needed results.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a Taurus, right?

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.320 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just very practical.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And I needed results.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And after this one
life activation,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I started having a continuous
string of results--

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
little results at first,
but significant and clear.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:90%
They were just clear results.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:90%
That's a shift.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And then even weeks
later, months later,

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I was still having these shifts
just from that one session.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Four months later, I was
able for the first time

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.140 align:middle line:84%
to connect the dots of, OK, I
have this passion for science.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I have this passion
for spirituality.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe my purpose is to
bring them together.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, that feels right.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to unite
science and spirituality.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But that means I'm
going to have to follow

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.760 align:middle line:90%
a nontraditional track.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's hard after
all of the energy and effort

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
you put into the
traditional track

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
to open yourself up to
the unknown of the new.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: It was a little scary
because there was no clear road

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
already paved for how to do it.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And every scientist that I knew
who had opened up to the fact

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:90%
that they were spiritual--

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:84%
they were all emeritus,
meaning they were all retired.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So their tenure couldn't
be stripped and so forth.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So they
were a long wait.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked at them like,
I don't want to wait that long.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about leaving
science and just going

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:90%
off and following my heart.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.580 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I actually attempted
to a couple of times.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:90%
I thought about leaving.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And I did leave at one
point and just tried

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to figure myself out while
still doing my spiritual growth.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And the universe just kept
pointing me back, saying,

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:90%
go finish your PhD.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Go finish your PhD.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Go finish your PhD.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And so at some point,
it was like, all right.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:90%
I surrender.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll go back.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll finish this.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.450 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to do it my way.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So I shifted from
neutrino physics

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:84%
to then working on a little
more of a smaller project, where

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:84%
I was working in a chemistry
lab doing crystal growth

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and then studying
origin of life stuff.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.597 align:middle line:90%
And it was very creative.

00:20:46.597 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So I got to bring in a
little bit more creativity.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But it was also a
one-person operation

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
versus a 100-person
cooperation So it was from one

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.480 align:middle line:90%
big to small.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.092 align:middle line:90%
It was really extreme.

00:20:56.092 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I work best somewhere

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.240 align:middle line:84%
in the middle with a small
team where we can bounce ideas

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:90%
off each other.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So I learned a lot
through the process.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:84%
There was quite a learning curve
to get through the rest of--

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, you'd think
that physics and chemistry

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:84%
are just next of kin
in terms of science.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:84%
But they speak completely
differently languages.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:84%
They have completely
different approaches.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So I had this huge learning
curve to go through.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.618 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a while
to get through all that.

00:21:20.618 --> 00:21:22.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But one thing--
through all of this,

00:21:22.535 --> 00:21:23.480 align:middle line:90%
you were very aware.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:84%
You had a lot of intention
at each step along the way,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.690 align:middle line:84%
whether it was to put
your foot on the gas

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.970 align:middle line:90%
or whether to back off.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
You made those conscious
decisions along the way.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I was very intuitive
and in touch with--

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I was very introspective.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I think I've always been
an introspective person.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.292 align:middle line:90%
And I wouldn't know why I knew.

00:21:45.292 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:90%
But I knew when I knew.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So with the Mystery
School work, for example,

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.570 align:middle line:90%
I kept seeing results.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.413 align:middle line:84%
And then as I kept
seeing results in my life

00:21:55.413 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that were very practical and
that really made a difference

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:84%
in my quality of life
and how I felt inside,

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
how I was able to deal
with the stress, all

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:84%
of these types of things, it led
me to then take the next step.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I got initiated
into their lineage.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I took another
step and another step.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And as long as it kept producing
results, I kept moving forward.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:90%
And it never stopped.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.330 align:middle line:84%
It never stopped
producing results.

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:90%
So I just kept moving forward.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And I realized when I got
into the Mystery School

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
teachings and the lineage,
the Western Mystery

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.960 align:middle line:84%
School, the hermetic teachings,
the kabbalistic teachings,

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:84%
the alchemical teachings, the
lineage of King Solomon stuff,

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.220 align:middle line:90%
it went pretty broad spectrum.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
it was one place

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
that I could-- all these
other interests that I

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:84%
had had from my spiritual
searching on my own,

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:90%
I found it all in one place.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:90%
And then it all started to gel.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And I got really
encouraged by it.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:90%
And then it also supported--

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I found that it
empowered me to break

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:84%
the mold within
the physics world

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how I'm going
to chart my path out.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I would
have been able to do it.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I would have had
the courage to shift who I was

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and how I showed up
in the world if it

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.240 align:middle line:84%
hadn't been for
my spiritual work

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.710 align:middle line:90%
with the Modern Mystery School.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because
it's a complex story,

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:84%
as you see from people
watching your shows.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:84%
You weave it together
slowly between material

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, going into
the atomic world, and so forth.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it has to
amount to the potential

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:84%
of human expression
and human experience.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end,
that's where all roads

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:90%
have to lead to, right?

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yes.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
You That's something
that I really

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.480 align:middle line:90%
realized in my own journey.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to
have the knowledge

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and to seek all the information
and gather all that knowledge.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's fascinating to me.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But there was several
points along the way

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:84%
where I was all
about the knowledge

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:01.490 align:middle line:90%
and not about the experience.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But that's normal.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.380 align:middle line:90%
That's part of that journey.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.922 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: It is
part of the journey.

00:24:04.922 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But it limited my
journey, right?

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So if that was as
far as I went, I

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.013 align:middle line:84%
would not have been able to
break through those barriers.

00:24:11.013 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So there were points
along the way where

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I had to let go of
what I thought I knew

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and just sink into
the emotional work,

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
or sink into the deeper
psyche and the soul,

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and completely let
go of the rationality

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and get into the spiritual
realm and experience it

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
even if I couldn't
explain it, and yet see

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:90%
the results from it.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.308 align:middle line:84%
So just because
science can't explain

00:24:35.308 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean it's not real
because it's producing results.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But that's where it stops
with a lot of people.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: But it
didn't with me, yeah.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what's wonderful about what

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:90%
you're doing.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So along the way, I assume
you must have-- obviously you

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.280 align:middle line:84%
must have encountered Amit
Goswami's work in "Physics

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:90%
of the Soul" and all.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And to me, my probably
deepest interest

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
is in the journey of a soul
from the moment of incarnation

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and to the moment of exit
and all of that knowledge,

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:84%
subconscious information that
we bring forward with us,

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
all that incredible desire
that expresses itself

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.500 align:middle line:90%
to express our potential.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.202 align:middle line:10%
And along that way,
there was one thing--

00:25:18.202 --> 00:25:20.410 align:middle line:10%
because I want to get into
your shows in a little bit

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.260 align:middle line:10%
and what you did
in the first series

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:10%
for those who haven't
seen it yet and then where

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:10%
you're going in your second
series coming up here.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.970 align:middle line:10%
But I want to get
into this one thing.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is anecdotal.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.290 align:middle line:84%
But it has to do with Amit
Goswami's "Physics of the Soul"

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.840 align:middle line:90%
in its own way.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Because in that
book, I think what's

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.450 align:middle line:84%
so astounding is he's
talking about this--

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.670 align:middle line:84%
incarnating into
the human realm.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:84%
This is where it
plays itself out--

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that a soul can sit between
incarnations, for example,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and essentially have very
little means of expression

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.120 align:middle line:84%
until it has all of these
aspects pulled together

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and a vehicle and a stage
and so forth to play out

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:84%
that dharma, whether it
be collective or personal,

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
or karma, collective
or personal.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it gets into the
notion of what kind of power

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.850 align:middle line:84%
a soul has coming
into an incarnation.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to
run this by you just

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.270 align:middle line:90%
because it's something I love.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And I asked one other person
years ago, a young physicist

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:90%
named William Brown.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you know William?

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:29.187 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: No I don't.

00:26:29.187 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was a devotee
of Nassim Haramein's.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And I found him
beyond brilliant,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.103 align:middle line:84%
just a very different
kind of mind entirely.

00:26:38.103 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So normally I don't
talk about it.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But what had happened
was I had met

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:90%
with a man who was an author.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:84%
He was science advisor
to President Reagan.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:90%
So he's an elderly gentleman.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.000 align:middle line:84%
This was in my Sedona Cafe days,
where everybody was wondering

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.155 align:middle line:90%
the cafe and say hello.

00:26:53.155 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:90%
And he wore a little beret.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we
should chat some time.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, sure.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And at dinner, he said he
was writing another book.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:84%
He had written
"Touchstone of Life."

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, now I'm
writing a new book.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking for the
organizing principle

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.970 align:middle line:84%
behind quantum coherence
and the development

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:90%
of the individuated human mind.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you
know the answer?

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'll know it by the
time I finish the book.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.070 align:middle line:90%
And we just laughed about it.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK, cool.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting project.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I went to bed and
woke up the next morning.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.890 align:middle line:90%
And that voice said--

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:34.560 align:middle line:90%
I wrote it down.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.630 align:middle line:84%
The exact words were,
the organizing principle

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:84%
behind quantum development of
the individuated human mind

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:90%
is the intention of the soul.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
heard that, for me,

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
it was like I'd
struck a pot of gold

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
not for him, but for myself and
the understanding of the power

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.560 align:middle line:84%
of the intention of a soul
even prior to incarnation

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.180 align:middle line:90%
and what it can do.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.530 align:middle line:90%
So I told him the answer.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.000 align:middle line:90%
The next day we had tea.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:90%
I said-- not the answer.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I said, I just want to share
with you something I heard.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And so I shared it with him.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.868 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh.

00:28:11.868 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
where did you hear this?

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.157 align:middle line:84%
And I said, when I was
waking up this morning.

00:28:16.157 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It was just a voice.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, oh.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.590 align:middle line:84%
He didn't finish the book,
wouldn't listen to it

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:84%
because it came from a female
that was just unintuitive.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And so he didn't do
anything with it.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.640 align:middle line:90%
But it never left me.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've shared that
with a few people

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:84%
because I think there's
something in there

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that we need to discover in
the power of our own being.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, in some of the
Mystery School teachings

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and in my Mystery
Teaching series,

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:47.065 align:middle line:84%
we talk about the
great central sun.

00:28:47.065 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:90%


00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:90%
I would call it "spirit."

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The basis
of Hermetics, yeah.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:10%
And that our original
spirit, the being

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:10%
that we are originally, had
a set of blueprints there.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:02.890 align:middle line:10%
And those blueprints get carried
with us all the way through

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:10%
based on intention or
purpose that we say,

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:10%
this is what I'm going to do.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And that all starts
with mind, right?

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.593 align:middle line:84%
So in the hermetic
teachings, all is mind.

00:29:12.593 --> 00:29:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All is mind.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Everything starts
with the consciousness

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:90%
or awareness or that intention.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And the will to pursue
it, the will to express it

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:90%
is what carries it out.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think something
between those--

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.917 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
will on a different level

00:29:25.917 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
than what we understand in our
normal parlance about will.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.317 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We think
we confuse will

00:29:30.317 --> 00:29:32.520 align:middle line:90%
with willfulness oftentimes.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you're speaking
of pure will on that level

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and you look at this,
there's a comfort

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
in understanding there are no
victims, really, in a sense.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.960 align:middle line:84%
In the greatest sense,
there are no victims.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.590 align:middle line:84%
That soul has
chosen its destiny.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:10%
Whether the conscious
mind comes in

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:53.080 align:middle line:10%
and whether earth life and
all of its little pleasures

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:10%
interferes with it
or not, the point

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:10%
is, it comes in with
this particular agenda

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.170 align:middle line:10%
to the point where--

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.410 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.050 align:middle line:10%
oh, "Biology of Belief,"
Bruce Lipton's work--

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:08.260 align:middle line:10%
where the soul can actually
manipulate the DNA and genetics

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.250 align:middle line:10%
prior to birth.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So the vehicle could show up
as it's needed by that soul.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And you've taken riff
on that for a minute.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.320 align:middle line:90%
So we choose the moment.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:90%
We choose the location.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.430 align:middle line:90%
We choose the name.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.740 align:middle line:84%
We choose everything in
that moment of birth.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And we know the
circumstances we're coming

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.260 align:middle line:90%
into from that spiritual plane.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.510 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, there are no victims.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.910 align:middle line:90%
We chose that life experience.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Why we chose it, what
lessons we're here for,

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.670 align:middle line:90%
that's an individual thing.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And we get into so
much judgment about it.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet the blueprints
we come in with,

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.750 align:middle line:84%
the spirit, the
soul into the body--

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.340 align:middle line:84%
the body is the final result,
the final manifestation,

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.660 align:middle line:90%
not the cause of.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So science today wants to be
the material bottom-up approach,

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.390 align:middle line:84%
where it's just a bunch
of neurons firing and DNA

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and genes arranging
themselves and that that's

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.230 align:middle line:90%
what creates consciousness.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's really the other way
around that that spirit comes

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
in with that consciousness,
which then influences

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.060 align:middle line:84%
the blueprints and the
soul, which influences how

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.830 align:middle line:84%
the genetic expression shows
up, how we manifest things

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.100 align:middle line:90%
at an atomic level.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Imagine if we
were taught this in school

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:90%
from an early age.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:90%
You are your creation.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And you've come here with
a unique genius and purpose

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:90%
of discovery, of expansion.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: And that's unique.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's you.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.240 align:middle line:84%
It's your spiritual
thumbprint in the universe,

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.890 align:middle line:84%
which is the difference
in what our world--

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:38.930 align:middle line:84%
how it would function
if people understood

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:90%
this about themselves.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But then let's get into the part
that is difficult for people.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is, yes, you chose
to come into the world.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.990 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like you had some
great influences growing up.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:90%
You had opportunity.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.630 align:middle line:90%
You went to private school.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:54.670 align:middle line:90%
You're beautiful.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:90%
You're in LA.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:84%
You're in California
and all that.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So then people really
start stumbling

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.820 align:middle line:84%
on this when you
look at cultures

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:84%
that are very deprived
on all levels even

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, perhaps,
what we would consider

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.920 align:middle line:84%
ethical or moral values in terms
of the respect of life itself

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.900 align:middle line:90%
or boys or girls and so forth.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well,
how is that fair?

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:90%
But again, there are no victims.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part I think
we need to embrace and respect

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.120 align:middle line:90%
in each other--

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.460 align:middle line:84%
this journey that we
are individually on.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.042 align:middle line:84%
And I would like you
to speak to that point.

00:32:31.042 --> 00:32:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Well, so
I heard a story once.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
the exact details

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:36.267 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not as good
at that kind of thing.

00:32:36.267 --> 00:32:40.190 align:middle line:84%
But I heard a story
of a woman who

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.420 align:middle line:84%
before she was 18 years old,
she had been raped many times.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
She grew up in an
abusive household.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.750 align:middle line:84%
She was in an
underprivileged community.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's an example
of a situation

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.360 align:middle line:84%
where there could
easily be victimhood

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:90%
around the situation.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and everyone else

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.180 align:middle line:84%
would perceive you
as a victim as well.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Exactly.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.600 align:middle line:90%
But it's a mindset.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.898 align:middle line:90%
Victimhood is a mindset.

00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:05.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not about your conditions.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:84%
It's about your attitude
towards your conditions.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And this woman didn't
let it stop her.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:15.680 align:middle line:10%
And she later went on
to become Oprah Winfrey.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.190 align:middle line:10%
And we can use whatever
our traumas are, whatever

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.920 align:middle line:10%
our circumstances are
as a learning ground

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.570 align:middle line:10%
for spiritual development.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's
the juiciest stuff.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.250 align:middle line:84%
That's where the alchemy really
can happen in a big way--

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.590 align:middle line:84%
is in those traumas
so long as we're

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.440 align:middle line:84%
willing to step onto that road
to healing and transformation

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.110 align:middle line:84%
to learn from it rather
than be defined by it.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
that story comes in

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and why it's, to me, the
most important story of all.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.280 align:middle line:90%
You are a unique divine soul.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.280 align:middle line:90%
You're here for purpose.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.390 align:middle line:90%
You chose it.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:51.927 align:middle line:90%
You chose all of it.

00:33:51.927 --> 00:33:52.760 align:middle line:90%
And now you're here.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.260 align:middle line:90%
And now you have to play it out.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.718 align:middle line:84%
And if you start looking around
you with that understanding

00:33:56.718 --> 00:33:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and you see things that happen
that are harsh that you're

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.100 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
contend with, then you

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.280 align:middle line:84%
can start asking,
what is the learning

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:84%
opportunity in this one
now as painful as it is?

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And then a whole
different set of questions

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:14.010 align:middle line:84%
comes up as to how to guide your
life from that moment forward.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Right.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And we look at the
world situation as well.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:19.929 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:23.659 align:middle line:84%
And I fully believe that
there is a collective mind

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:24.889 align:middle line:90%
and we are all connected.

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.440 align:middle line:84%
In those higher levels of
consciousness and mind,

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.469 align:middle line:90%
we are all connected.

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:30.170 align:middle line:90%
So there is a collective mind.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:33.139 align:middle line:84%
And those thoughts
that are going

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.230 align:middle line:84%
on at a critical mass
within the collective mind

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.060 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to
manifest themselves

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:90%
somewhere on the planet.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.929 align:middle line:84%
And so we are the
ones collectively

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.909 align:middle line:84%
who are manifesting these
areas where we think,

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:45.750 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's not fair.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.139 align:middle line:84%
Why should somebody be born
into that kind of poverty,

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.570 align:middle line:84%
that kind of abuse, or
that kind of slavery?

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:90%
But we're creating that.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.510 align:middle line:84%
We collectively are creating
that because we have lack

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.310 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.170 align:middle line:90%
We abuse ourselves.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:58.460 align:middle line:90%
We feel poor.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.670 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
that are within us--

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.872 align:middle line:84%
we're constantly feeding
that into the collective.

00:35:03.872 --> 00:35:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to
manifest somewhere.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.788 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and I think we have

00:35:06.788 --> 00:35:11.180 align:middle line:84%
to also be aware that most of
us have been all these things.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So you're only
getting a snapshot

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:84%
in this incarnation
of what you've been.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel as
though, gosh, I've

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:21.310 align:middle line:84%
never had to go through anything
that harsh, for example.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:22.600 align:middle line:90%
That's really not fair.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.445 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes you have.

00:35:23.445 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't
remember that.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.340 align:middle line:84%
But you probably have been
through that and worse.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not to
dismiss the pain

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and suffering of any
individual in any incarnation

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:90%
on any level.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's simply,
I think, to rise

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:46.170 align:middle line:84%
into a position of understanding
the individual that you feel

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:49.360 align:middle line:84%
you're viewing as a victim
for their own reasons

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:84%
has chosen this incredibly
challenging situation

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:90%
in this time.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And you have been
there before, too.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So all you need to give
is support and empathy to,

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.258 align:middle line:90%
yes, grow this thing.

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:01.300 align:middle line:90%
What are you discovering?

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.705 align:middle line:84%
What are you learning,
including with other cultures?

00:36:03.705 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean we
don't go in and help where

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.560 align:middle line:84%
humanitarian help is needed
for a group of people

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.800 align:middle line:90%
who are seriously in trouble.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.780 align:middle line:90%
You have to do.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.030 align:middle line:90%
We have to do that as humans.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
part of this, too--

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and my understanding of
it may differ from yours,

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know--

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
DNA component also

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.430 align:middle line:84%
that often accompanies
incarnation,

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.520 align:middle line:84%
where you can accompany a
strand of DNA, a bloodline,

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.490 align:middle line:84%
for a variety of reasons
and continue incarnating

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:34.480 align:middle line:84%
into some offshoot at least
of a given bloodline that

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.940 align:middle line:84%
has some of that familiar DNA
laid down for a lot of reasons.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:38.740 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is because we've
developed associations

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that we'd like to either
rekindle or simply

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.230 align:middle line:84%
balance out oftentimes, finish
up, finish up business with.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:48.920 align:middle line:90%
But it's even more than that.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when you
get into a culture that

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:55.270 align:middle line:84%
does not seem to be progressing
from an outside view?

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.040 align:middle line:90%
It's much more isolated.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.780 align:middle line:84%
The customs have
remained unchanged

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.180 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds or even
thousands of years.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We on the outside start viewing
them as primitive individuals.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't they moving
into the modern age?

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that for a moment.

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:11.523 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Well, so
I certainly believe

00:37:11.523 --> 00:37:12.940 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to choose our DNA

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.920 align:middle line:84%
line that we come into
for all the reasons

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.240 align:middle line:90%
of what it equips us with.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And we also are living out
the karma of our ancestors.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're here with
the opportunity

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.390 align:middle line:84%
to help remedy
that, karma that's

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.610 align:middle line:84%
been established
in our collective

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and in our ancestral
lines and so forth.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I look
at the people who

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:39.580 align:middle line:84%
are choosing to incarnate into
less-than-privileged situations

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.550 align:middle line:84%
or extreme poverty or
starvation, any of that,

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I see that those
spirits are like saints.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:84%
They're coming and doing
a service to humanity.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Because if it weren't for those
incarnations, we as humanity

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.023 align:middle line:84%
would not have that reflection--
saying, oh, look at the poverty

00:37:56.023 --> 00:37:57.190 align:middle line:90%
we're creating in the world.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Look at the imbalance.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wouldn't
draw all the empathy out.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Exactly.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.260 align:middle line:90%
And so they're serving--

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.402 align:middle line:84%
in an individual level,
it's a bad situation.

00:38:04.402 --> 00:38:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're working
with their own development.

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:08.568 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And they have
their own development.

00:38:08.568 --> 00:38:11.440 align:middle line:84%
But they're in service in a way
that most people's minds can't.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.840 align:middle line:84%
They have a hard time
wrapping it around that idea

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that they're in service
to us as a collective.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
an interesting idea

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.510 align:middle line:84%
because what is the one time
when people's hearts actually

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:20.310 align:middle line:90%
open?

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is a matrix that has
that solvent of universal love

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:27.350 align:middle line:84%
there at the core except when
other people are suffering.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's collectively
through a mass disaster

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of some kind or whether
it's individually,

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.790 align:middle line:84%
our hearts open when
others are in pain.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And when we
judge it as, it's not fair,

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that's us judging a situation
within ourselves that we

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.940 align:middle line:90%
haven't resolved as well.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And in order to really have
empathy and compassion,

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:84%
we have to accept that within
ourselves rather than judge.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I believe
that we are all here at a time

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.880 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that is a very
exciting time on the planet.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have huge
opportunities, too.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But we're at a major
crossroads in terms

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:06.640 align:middle line:90%
of where we go as a collective.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.110 align:middle line:90%
We can destroy ourselves.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Or we can create
a utopia, what I

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.270 align:middle line:84%
would call a "shambala,"
a world of peace,

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:17.050 align:middle line:84%
a world of prosperity, a world
where there is more balance

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and harmony, where
we all are seeing

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.830 align:middle line:84%
each other as divine
beings that we are versus

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.860 align:middle line:84%
this continued
materialistic, greed-driven,

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.650 align:middle line:84%
have and have not
kind of civilization.

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's where
we add another layer to the top

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.730 align:middle line:84%
because we have such
advancements intellectually.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And you get us to
the subject of AI.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And like all things, in the
hands of beautiful minds,

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:84%
it can be used in
a beautiful way.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:45.650 align:middle line:84%
In the hands of others, it has a
totally destructive expression.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So how do you see the
role of AI at this time

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.190 align:middle line:90%
and its potential development?

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Well, I
mean, without a doubt,

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.980 align:middle line:84%
our world is going
to radically be

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:84%
different within
five to seven years

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.540 align:middle line:84%
from now because of
the technologies.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Between AI, 3D printing,
quantum technologies,

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.740 align:middle line:84%
all of these things are coming
online at the same time.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And medicine is changing.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything is changing.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Yet, as you say, each of
these things are tools.

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And that tool is in the
hands of the beholder.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.760 align:middle line:84%
If it's a beautiful
mind, it's going

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.085 align:middle line:90%
to be used in a beautiful way.

00:40:22.085 --> 00:40:23.460 align:middle line:84%
If it's a destructive
mind, it'll

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.180 align:middle line:90%
be used in a destructive way.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, it's really
about shifting consciousness

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.740 align:middle line:84%
of humanity and the
collective so that we

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.480 align:middle line:84%
can take these
tools and technology

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and then choose to
apply them with wisdom.

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I feel
science and spirituality need

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.470 align:middle line:84%
to come together
so that we can have

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:47.550 align:middle line:84%
that wisdom of the ancient
spiritual traditions coming

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and merging with science in a
good way that allows science

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.810 align:middle line:84%
to do what it does, but also
guide it in a way that--

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:56.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's apply
this with wisdom.

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's apply this towards
the progression of humanity,

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.950 align:middle line:84%
not just the
progression of the few.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And let's really use
these tools and technology

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.490 align:middle line:84%
to create that heaven
on earth kind of thing.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's really create a world--

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.930 align:middle line:84%
or, as scientists
today would call it,

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:90%
a type one civilization--

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.292 align:middle line:90%
that's really going beyond--

00:41:17.292 --> 00:41:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Michio
Kaku's work, yeah.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Michio Kaku.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was quoting from other
people who have done this work.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we are right on
that verge within the next

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.735 align:middle line:84%
maybe 100 years or so,
where we're right there.

00:41:29.735 --> 00:41:30.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.068 align:middle line:84%
And I think part
of it is, we can't

00:41:32.068 --> 00:41:33.720 align:middle line:84%
buy into the allure
of the advertising

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.410 align:middle line:84%
for physical immortality
because that's really

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:40.740 align:middle line:84%
the hook that people that are
putting that agenda out there

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.730 align:middle line:90%
are using.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I think most
people, except those

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.210 align:middle line:84%
who are really devoutly
deeply spiritual

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and believe in the
continuance of consciousness,

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.960 align:middle line:90%
have fear around dying.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So you can understand
that allure.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.960 align:middle line:90%
But we're being played by that.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Death is the number-one fear
in humanity on the planet.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And I have personally
experienced

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that having that deep
spiritual philosophy to know

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.910 align:middle line:84%
that we are not just
our physical bodies,

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:11.760 align:middle line:84%
that we are eternal
beings, and that we

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.190 align:middle line:84%
have lots of really
great adventures to go on

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:90%
after this physical life--

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that that gives a lot of
comfort and more confidence.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can let go of
the fears of death.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But it is scary to
me what's happening

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.760 align:middle line:84%
with AI in the sense of,
let's just transfer our brain

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.305 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
into that computer

00:42:31.305 --> 00:42:33.630 align:middle line:84%
so that we can achieve
physical immortality

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:35.340 align:middle line:90%
and be here forever.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.230 align:middle line:84%
That is a frightening
proposition.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's possible
because you might transfer bits

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.023 align:middle line:90%
of information and knowledge.

00:42:43.023 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going
to transfer a soul.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What about the soul?

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've
always said in that debate.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But you can understand
where people

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.830 align:middle line:84%
have been from the restrictive
thinking of dogmatic religion

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and driven toward basically
intellectualism and atheism.

00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And now a lot of
people are reaching out

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:03.750 align:middle line:84%
with these delicate little
tendrils within them

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:06.930 align:middle line:84%
to find these spiritual
expressions that can't be

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:09.180 align:middle line:90%
categorized in religious terms.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the feeling way

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.530 align:middle line:84%
into this new
consciousness that has

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:18.210 align:middle line:84%
to take hold before any kind
of substantial inculcation

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:22.102 align:middle line:84%
of the bad AI makes
it into our world.

00:43:22.102 --> 00:43:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: I think AI can
be used in a very good way.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.435 align:middle line:84%
And even some of the
integration can be used in tech.

00:43:27.435 --> 00:43:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Integration can be used
in a really good way.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.227 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I agree.

00:43:30.227 --> 00:43:31.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
a bad use of it.

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: But yeah,
we have to make

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:34.810 align:middle line:90%
that shift in consciousness.

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have to get in
connection with, who am I?

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Who am I is not about my body.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's not-- yeah,
my genes and all

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.200 align:middle line:90%
of that and my upbringing.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It makes an influence on
our personality and maybe

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.180 align:middle line:90%
our physical attributes.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But who we are is
not about this body.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.720 align:middle line:90%
It's the soul.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the eternal spirit.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It's all of this other
energy and blueprint

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.690 align:middle line:90%
that we came in with.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we need
to get in touch with.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't agree with you more.

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Listen, let's go ahead then.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get
to your show now.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.202 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for letting
us get to know you more.

00:44:10.202 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.327 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah, it was fun.

00:44:12.327 --> 00:44:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's go to
the first season of "Mystery

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Teachings" and really how you
laid the framework for those

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.752 align:middle line:90%
who have not seen it yet.

00:44:19.752 --> 00:44:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: So the first
season of "Mystery Teachings"

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.170 align:middle line:84%
is very much about, OK,
let's look at the physics

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:26.910 align:middle line:90%
and what it really says.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Where is mainstream
physics at today?

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.410 align:middle line:84%
What are the most
popular theories?

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:34.320 align:middle line:84%
What is something like
the standard model

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that is sort of like the
Bible to scientists right now?

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:39.750 align:middle line:84%
What are the more
cutting edge that

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:43.290 align:middle line:84%
are not necessarily
proven, but they

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.720 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of support
within mainstream science,

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.920 align:middle line:84%
like string theory and big
bang inflation cosmology

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and multiverse theories
and things like that?

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So we look at, what
is the science?

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And what is it really
saying, without getting

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.630 align:middle line:90%
into all the math.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And then where
does it leave off?

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Where are they falling
short in trying

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to find their theory of
everything, for example?

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And then what does
metaphysics have to say?

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And how can the two
complement each other?

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So we go pretty deeply into
what the physics really

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:14.130 align:middle line:84%
says because there's
a lot of people

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.780 align:middle line:84%
out there talking
about, oh, you know,

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:84%
the observer effect and quantum
physics says and quantum

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.000 align:middle line:90%
physics proves this and that.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But spiritually, quantum
physics doesn't prove anything

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:27.080 align:middle line:84%
because those experimental
studies haven't been done.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So part of my goal with the
series is to honor the science

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and what the scientists would
say and what they wouldn't say.

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm very clear.

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:36.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Now we're crossing the bridge
to what metaphysics says.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:40.130 align:middle line:90%
This is the science.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:42.280 align:middle line:90%
This is metaphysics.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.830 align:middle line:90%
But let's see the parallels.

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And then what if science were
to open up to the metaphysics?

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Because metaphysics
is scientific.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I say "metaphysics,"
I don't mean new age.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.655 align:middle line:84%
I mean ancient Mystery
School teachings, hermetics.

00:45:58.655 --> 00:45:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:03.330 align:middle line:84%
It's simply the unseen world
that is motivating and creating

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:04.130 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:05.713 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Beyond
the physical, right?

00:46:05.713 --> 00:46:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Meta is above or
beyond the physical.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet there is a science
in these ancient mystery

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:11.370 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:12.822 align:middle line:90%
There's a science to hermetics.

00:46:12.822 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:90%
There's a science to alchemy.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:17.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a science
to even Kabbalah.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So these sciences-- they
think in a scientific way.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.610 align:middle line:84%
They're just working
from the spiritual

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:24.770 align:middle line:84%
down rather than
the physical up.

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can bring
the spiritual down,

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.495 align:middle line:84%
and then we have the
mainstream science that's

00:46:29.495 --> 00:46:32.400 align:middle line:84%
bringing physical up, where
do the two meet in the middle?

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I explore
a lot of in season one.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much physics
and then metaphysics.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And we get into the seven
hermetic principles.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And we get into some alchemy
and a lot of Kabbalah

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.353 align:middle line:84%
from the Mystery
School teachings.

00:46:46.353 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit
different than what

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.130 align:middle line:90%
you would find in the books.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
to also point out

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.570 align:middle line:84%
that, as I said at
the top of the show,

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Guy has done such a beautiful
job in production with really

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:02.870 align:middle line:84%
aiding the story with amazing
animated graphics and such.

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:04.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not hard to follow you.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you're talking physics.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But you're watching
it magically appear.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.960 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.822 align:middle line:84%
And I do my best to
try and deliver it

00:47:12.822 --> 00:47:14.780 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's, OK,
well, here's what it says.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:15.697 align:middle line:90%
But what does it mean?

00:47:15.697 --> 00:47:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And then just very quickly,
let's do it in a way

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:21.380 align:middle line:84%
that people can understand
this because I don't like it

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.030 align:middle line:84%
when physicists try to
be intellectually elite.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk over your head.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Talk over
your head, right?

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.230 align:middle line:90%
So I want people to understand.

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:31.752 align:middle line:84%
And I do my best to be clear and
put the puzzle pieces together.

00:47:31.752 --> 00:47:32.552 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You are.

00:47:32.552 --> 00:47:34.219 align:middle line:84%
You're very clear in
your communication.

00:47:34.219 --> 00:47:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: And then also,
how does this relate to us?

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:38.590 align:middle line:84%
If we were to take
it as a metaphor--

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:39.980 align:middle line:90%
that's another thing I do.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:43.820 align:middle line:84%
If we were to take the
quantum paradigm as a metaphor

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:47.390 align:middle line:84%
that we can apply into to life,
that we can apply to business,

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.900 align:middle line:84%
we can apply to relationships,
we can apply to understanding

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.270 align:middle line:84%
who and what we are,
and so forth, we

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:57.320 align:middle line:84%
can apply to our world, how
do we shift our paradigm?

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the old
Newtonian paradigm

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:01.340 align:middle line:90%
was applied in that way.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.480 align:middle line:90%
You see it in economics.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.540 align:middle line:90%
You see it in education.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.660 align:middle line:84%
You see it in the
industrial age.

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And we've inherited
that mindset,

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.370 align:middle line:84%
which is a filter that we
perceive everything through.

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And if we can shift that
fundamental paradigm

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and base it on a newer
model, like quantum physics,

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.350 align:middle line:84%
how would that shift our way
of perceiving and viewing

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:20.150 align:middle line:90%
the world?

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And then everything that
we engage ourselves in--

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:27.860 align:middle line:84%
so more connectivity,
more flow with uncertainty

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.273 align:middle line:84%
rather than thinking we
can control everything--

00:48:30.273 --> 00:48:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Out of fear.

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: --out of fear,
more recognition of the impact

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:39.080 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and the
context that we are assumptions

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.220 align:middle line:90%
that we make--

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.460 align:middle line:84%
really determines the
results that get created.

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's the observer
effect-- is that context

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:48.910 align:middle line:90%
that we create for things.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of these metaphors.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And then have fun with weaving
it in with a lot of the Mystery

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.710 align:middle line:84%
School teachings,
which is really more

00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:59.550 align:middle line:90%
my work and my passion today.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:03.077 align:middle line:84%
So before we launch into
season two and the description

00:49:03.077 --> 00:49:05.660 align:middle line:84%
of the upcoming episodes, let's
take a look at a little teaser

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:06.743 align:middle line:90%
that Guy has put together.

00:49:06.743 --> 00:49:09.130 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:09.930 align:middle line:90%


00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Is there a way to
harness our quantum potential

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and truly direct the
course of reality?

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Many people are talking about
a shift in human evolution.

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.320 align:middle line:90%
What is driving this shift?

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And how do we steer it
in a positive direction?

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:31.060 align:middle line:84%
The answers to these questions
truly rests in our hands.

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Human thought is still very
much stuck in a Newtownian way

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.890 align:middle line:90%
of operating.

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:38.510 align:middle line:90%
One thing is for sure.

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Achieving such a balance will
require a core shift in how

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:44.750 align:middle line:90%
we think, act, and relate--

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:47.660 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
a paradigm shift.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:48.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.905 align:middle line:10%
And this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:49:52.905 --> 00:49:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
the next season coming up.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So season two is going
to be much more practical

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:00.330 align:middle line:90%
and applied.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So season one, I feel, is
laying in a lot of the concepts

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.045 align:middle line:90%
and the foundational theory.

00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And then season two
is like, all right.

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Now how do we take this to
truly awaken our potential?

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.640 align:middle line:90%
What is our potential?

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.450 align:middle line:90%
How can we tap into more of it?

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.280 align:middle line:84%
How can we use more
of our DNA capacity?

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.110 align:middle line:84%
How can we use more
of our brain capacity?

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:21.400 align:middle line:84%
How can we turn on
our superpowers?

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.550 align:middle line:84%
How can we awaken our
spiritual gifts and intuition?

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm bringing
in still the science,

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.310 align:middle line:84%
but more like DNA science,
brain science, and so forth.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we're bringing in
a lot more Mystery School

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.840 align:middle line:84%
teachings and
practical applications.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So there will be
an actual takeaway

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.300 align:middle line:84%
at the end of every episode
in season two with, OK.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Now try this out for the week.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And work with this
visualization.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Or work with that affirmation
and things like this

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to help people now
start bringing this

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:53.300 align:middle line:90%
in to application.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.308 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it's
one thing to know it

00:50:56.308 --> 00:50:57.350 align:middle line:90%
and to have the concepts.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing to
experience it, to live it,

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:03.440 align:middle line:84%
to apply it, and really
have that feedback so

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.935 align:middle line:84%
that we can say, oh,
yeah, this really is true.

00:51:05.935 --> 00:51:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Rather than just
believing in it,

00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:09.920 align:middle line:84%
we can really know
and understand

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.480 align:middle line:90%
ultimately that this is true.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're guiding people
to walk the path,

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.860 align:middle line:84%
to start taking
those steps to doing

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.420 align:middle line:90%
the transformational work.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we get into the
science of ascension.

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:30.320 align:middle line:84%
We get into the science
of DNA awakening.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.120 align:middle line:90%
There's multidimensionality.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.370 align:middle line:84%
How do we access more of
our multidimensionality?

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:36.440 align:middle line:90%
What does that really mean?

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.140 align:middle line:84%
We get into galactic
connection and how we

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:43.070 align:middle line:90%
awaken our galactic potential.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's a part 1 and
a part 2 in season--

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.347 align:middle line:84%
so the first seven
episodes around

00:51:49.347 --> 00:51:51.680 align:middle line:84%
are part 1, which is just
awakening our potential in all

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.860 align:middle line:84%
these different areas of
our multidimensionality,

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.070 align:middle line:84%
our physical and
spiritual senses,

00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:00.028 align:middle line:84%
to become more heightened
in our intuition,

00:52:00.028 --> 00:52:01.570 align:middle line:84%
understanding how
our mind works, how

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:06.290 align:middle line:84%
we take in information, process
that, perceive it, act upon it,

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, really
breaking it down.

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the second half of the
season is all about the brain

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and how our brain is wired from
birth forwards and then how

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:18.420 align:middle line:84%
we can rewire it from
now moving forward.

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
tools that can really

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.897 align:middle line:84%
help us maximize
that rewiring so

00:52:21.897 --> 00:52:24.230 align:middle line:84%
that we can start turning on
more and more of that brain

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:25.340 align:middle line:90%
capacity?

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Removing the filters.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BULLARD: Removing the
filters and also harmonizing.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So the brain builds its
way up from the bottom up

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:36.280 align:middle line:90%
and the back forward.

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about
the prefrontal cortex

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.520 align:middle line:90%
being our executive brain.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.920 align:middle line:84%
It's where we make
our decisions.

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:47.210 align:middle line:84%
But if your old brain,
or the brain stem area,

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:52.160 align:middle line:84%
wasn't properly developed when
you were a baby or in childhood

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and so forth as the
brain grew, if there

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:57.500 align:middle line:84%
was traumas and disruptions
in the growth patterns,

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:01.400 align:middle line:84%
then that will hijack
your prefrontal cortex

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.400 align:middle line:84%
when a stressful situation or
a fear-type trigger comes up.

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean the whole
kind reptilian amygdala complex

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.050 align:middle line:90%
in there?

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Everything, yeah.

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And it might be kind of a
chaotic wiring in there.

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to do is we
want to work our way back

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.560 align:middle line:84%
from the front, back, and down
so that we can rewire things

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.960 align:middle line:84%
intentionally in
a harmonious way

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and gain more interconnectivity
between all the different brain

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:30.290 align:middle line:84%
regions to have more
full capacity and access

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:31.343 align:middle line:90%
at a conscious level.

00:53:31.343 --> 00:53:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
a big one because there

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.677 align:middle line:84%
are very few brains
out there that

00:53:34.677 --> 00:53:36.323 align:middle line:90%
have not experienced trauma.

00:53:36.323 --> 00:53:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't experience
it in their childhood,

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.410 align:middle line:84%
they probably carried it
through from another time

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.285 align:middle line:84%
because you have to look
at that whole matrix

00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:44.130 align:middle line:84%
of the subconscious
mind as well, right?

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just that
alone is how do

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:52.160 align:middle line:84%
we transcend the filters of
the subconscious mind, which

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I find absolutely fascinating.

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to do kind
of how-tos on this stuff.

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:57.977 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: More how-to, yeah.

00:53:57.977 --> 00:54:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And people have been asking
for that based on some

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:01.480 align:middle line:90%
of the feedback in season one.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.831 align:middle line:84%
They've been asking
for, I love all of this.

00:54:03.831 --> 00:54:04.956 align:middle line:90%
And I love the information.

00:54:04.956 --> 00:54:08.450 align:middle line:84%
But I want more of
what to do with it.

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And so in season
two, we're going

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:12.327 align:middle line:84%
to deliver a lot more
of what to do with it.

00:54:12.327 --> 00:54:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.035 align:middle line:90%
I think that's great.

00:54:14.035 --> 00:54:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Can you give us a teaser?

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:16.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going to
ask how you deprogram--

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and not deprogram, but
remove the filters--

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.210 align:middle line:84%
of the trauma from the
past because that's

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:24.978 align:middle line:90%
going to be a long explanation.

00:54:24.978 --> 00:54:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And we only have like
three or four minutes left.

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.030 align:middle line:84%
But maybe give us
one how-to teaser

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:32.200 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to get to
that we can look forward to,

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:37.190 align:middle line:84%
anything down to accessing
more of our own electricity,

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:40.880 align:middle line:84%
our own field of energy
for physical purposes even

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.290 align:middle line:90%
in the material realm.

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you address that at all?

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yeah.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned, for
example, earlier the DNA

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and Bruce Lipton's work
with "Biology of Belief."

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So one of the episodes
really gets pretty deep into,

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.480 align:middle line:84%
how does our DNA
work at a physics

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.920 align:middle line:90%
or at a scientific level?

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.410 align:middle line:84%
How does our DNA work from
the kabbalistic perspective,

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.690 align:middle line:84%
working with the tree
of life and so forth?

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:07.070 align:middle line:90%


00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And as we know from
epigenetics now,

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.130 align:middle line:90%
our thoughts make a difference.

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Our behaviors, our lifestyle
choices make a difference.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:16.852 align:middle line:84%
Our attitudes, the
words we speak,

00:55:16.852 --> 00:55:19.310 align:middle line:84%
the things we think, the things
we do-- all of these things

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:20.540 align:middle line:90%
make a difference.

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:25.760 align:middle line:10%
So try working with this
particular set of affirmations

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:29.523 align:middle line:10%
or work with this geometry
of the tree of life.

00:55:29.523 --> 00:55:31.565 align:middle line:10%
And every time you work
with that sacred geometry

00:55:31.565 --> 00:55:34.670 align:middle line:10%
of the tree of life, you're
communicating to your DNA.

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:37.030 align:middle line:10%
And as you work your way
through the tree of life,

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:42.110 align:middle line:10%
it's helping remind your
DNA of your core blueprint

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:43.220 align:middle line:10%
and pattern.

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like we're
learning the language.

00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I talked in season one a
bit about numbers, letters,

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and sounds and sacred
geometries as being

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:57.230 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental building
blocks of our universe.

00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And if we can learn
that language,

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:01.910 align:middle line:84%
how to use numbers
properly, letters properly,

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:05.540 align:middle line:84%
sounds properly, sacred
geometries properly, then we

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.580 align:middle line:84%
can take those as
tools and start

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:09.900 align:middle line:84%
communicating with the
universe, with ourselves,

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.162 align:middle line:84%
with our DNA, all of these
things-- our atomic structures.

00:56:13.162 --> 00:56:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is some of the things
we're going to explore.

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:16.912 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's
going to be fun.

00:56:16.912 --> 00:56:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of this
really points back even

00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:22.400 align:middle line:84%
into more ancient times into
the Vedas, the Sri Yantras,

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and such that people
in our community--

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:27.200 align:middle line:84%
almost everyone watching
this has probably

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.560 align:middle line:84%
had some experience,
whether it's through mantras

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.590 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's through some
amazing geometrical forms

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:34.410 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to be
working through those areas.

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:37.738 align:middle line:84%
And I bring it up
because this is already

00:56:37.738 --> 00:56:40.610 align:middle line:84%
familiar through some of
those studies to some people.

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be taking
it into a very practical arena

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.890 align:middle line:90%
that's explained scientifically.

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:47.900 align:middle line:90%
So no more ifs, ands, and buts.

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:48.900 align:middle line:90%
This stuff works, right?

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Yes.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and also showing some
parallels, for example,

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:57.540 align:middle line:84%
between the kabbalistic system,
the I Ching from the Taoist

00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:01.432 align:middle line:84%
system, the Yantra system,
and how they work together,

00:57:01.432 --> 00:57:02.390 align:middle line:90%
how they work together.

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:03.955 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, universal.

00:57:03.955 --> 00:57:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
fascinating.

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:06.110 align:middle line:90%
We only have a minute left.

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts before
we take off here today

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:08.030 align:middle line:90%
to sign off?

00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:08.947 align:middle line:90%
>>BULLARD: Oh my gosh.

00:57:08.947 --> 00:57:12.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm just very
excited that the series

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.480 align:middle line:90%
is getting such great feedback.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really
hoping that we can--

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:18.680 align:middle line:84%
because the ultimate
purpose of this

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.730 align:middle line:84%
was to deliver content
that would really empower

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:25.340 align:middle line:90%
people to want to transform.

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not just about
consuming the information.

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:30.590 align:middle line:84%
It is about, let's get
inspired and empowered

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and realize that there's
a reality to this work

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and that if we take
it into action,

00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.460 align:middle line:90%
we can transform our lives.

00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.260 align:middle line:90%
We can transform our world view.

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:40.820 align:middle line:90%
We can transform our world.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is a big part of
what this is all about.

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:47.360 align:middle line:10%
So I feel that bringing science
and spirituality together

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.580 align:middle line:10%
and then applying it
in our lives in a way

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.710 align:middle line:10%
that we really can apply
to make a difference

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:52.580 align:middle line:10%
is what this is
all talking about.

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Add a little passion.

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Add a little intention.

when you were young.
