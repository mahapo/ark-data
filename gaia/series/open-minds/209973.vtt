00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE RICKSECKER:
You're not thinking

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.190 align:middle line:84%
shadow person, or
ghost, or anything

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:90%
like that at that moment.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.640 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking there's
an intruder in the house.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.480 align:middle line:90%
And I'm frightened.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.030 align:middle line:84%
When it approached
my bed and crossed

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.648 align:middle line:84%
the arms, what it was trying to
do is put me into a self-hug.

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Let's go
to the black-eyed children.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: They
were really creepy.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Really creepy.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you stare
at a light bulb too long?

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.627 align:middle line:90%
You no longer see the light.

00:00:31.627 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:84%
You just see this dark
silhouette of the bulb.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:84%
With Alaska, it's like
this really full cocktail

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:90%
of different energies.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
One of them does happen
to be shadow activity.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You say since
1988, 16,000 people have gone

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.467 align:middle line:90%
missing in the Alaska Triangle.

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: It's an
extremely high number.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A nuclear
bomb also disappeared.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: One strange
thing about human beings

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:10%
is we love to be
frightened and intrigued.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:10%
This makes today's
guest particularly fun

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:10%
because he's going to be
talking about the shadow people.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may have seen them,
as have I. The trick is not

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:90%
to let them scare you.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Mike, so good to see you.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
having me today, Regina.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad to
have this conversation

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
because so many
people are frightened

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.890 align:middle line:90%
of what we don't understand.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
it sets a template.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into
fear of something,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:90%
you create a resonance with it.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:84%
That's what people
also don't understand.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And then it
just sets things up

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:90%
for whatever is coming next.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.262 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
you first as a little kid,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and how you got into this
all of this phenomenon.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:90%
You do a lot of videos on.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.350 align:middle line:84%
You've also done another
show or two here on Gaia.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
how you ended up

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:84%
in this field as a little
kid and ultimately going

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
through a regression
session and recovered

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:90%
some interesting phenomena.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yes.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:10%
It was truly fascinating.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:10%
And it did start off when I
was about eight years old,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.560 align:middle line:10%
small child laying
in bed one night.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And kind of the
typical story you hear.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Waking up in the
middle of the night

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a tall, dark shadow
in the corner of the bedroom.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:90%
And that happened to me.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:90%
I was very frightened.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're not thinking shadow
person, or ghost, or anything

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:90%
like that at that moment.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking there's
an intruder in the house.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.187 align:middle line:10%
Somebody's broken in.

00:02:19.187 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they're trying
to rob the place.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.840 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's a tall
figure, tall something.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And I'm frightened.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm trying to scream.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.750 align:middle line:90%
My mouth opens up.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's coming
out of my mouth.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And it did something
very, very unusual.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.870 align:middle line:90%
It approached my bed.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:90%
It leaned over.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.543 align:middle line:84%
I'm staring up in
this blank black face.

00:02:37.543 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:90%
No eyes.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No features.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: No features.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just like
a shadow of a person.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.082 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:45.381 align:middle line:90%
It was like a living shadow.

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
It did something very
unusual after that.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It actually got physical,
grabbed me by the wrists,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
crossed my arms across my
body, ran off down the hall,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:90%
and of all places into a closet.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
No idea why he ran into a
closet, but that's what it did.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Finally found my
voice, found my legs,

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:84%
ran off screaming to
my parents' bedroom.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And I have very
nice, kind parents.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to console me,
calm me down, telling me that I

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:90%
had just had a bad dream.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
But I knew I was awake
for this entire thing.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:90%
This was not a dream.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the first thing
that really set me up

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:84%
for the research that I've
done throughout my life.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about--

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, besides obviously
being frightened

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
by an intruder, if you were
able during the regression

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
to recover any other feelings
and senses about the presence

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
of the shadow person,
whether they felt kind

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:90%
of cold, ominous, electrical.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Was there any-- what were
the feelings surrounding

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:90%
the experience?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And later in
hindsight, did it ever

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.158 align:middle line:84%
make sense to you that he
positioned your arms like this?

00:03:54.158 --> 00:03:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
What was really fascinating
about the regression was

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I actually got to see the
perspective of the situation

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:90%
from the shadow.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually looking down
onto my eight-year-old little

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
body, which, for one, that was
an absolutely fascinating to be

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:90%
able to see that--

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:90%
my eight-year-old little self.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:84%
But I did get to feel what the
shadow was actually feeling--

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:90%
this being, this entity.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And for one, it didn't know
at first that I could see it.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
It finally figured that
out after I reacted to it.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:84%
It was there to study humanity,
to watch, observe, research.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.165 align:middle line:84%
And once it figured out
that I could see it,

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:90%
because I'm reacting to it.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.165 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to scream.

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's coming
out of my mouth.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:90%
It felt horrible.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't trying to
make his presence known.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't trying to scare me.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So when it approached
my bed and crossed

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.367 align:middle line:84%
the arms, what it was trying to
do is put me into a self-hug.

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was wondering.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.050 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it was
a protective position.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.092 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:05:02.092 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And another thing I got to
see from that perspective

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.148 align:middle line:84%
was it actually patted
me on the wrists,

00:05:07.148 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and then got out of
there, out of the room.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Before anyone else--
before he was detected.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.303 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right.

00:05:12.303 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The rest came
down when you're screaming,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:90%
running through the house.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So what happened to
you after you viewed it

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
from that perspective,
now you're

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:84%
an adult at this
time viewing this?

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:84%
You are aware of other
phenomena, other experiences.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
What did that
regression do in terms

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.187 align:middle line:84%
of your understanding of
phenomena just in that glimpse?

00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Well it's really eye-opening.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
For one, and this
is something I've

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
been talking about for years,
not all of these things

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:90%
are dark, nasty, nefarious.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:84%
There are many benevolent
beings out there

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that may be taking this shape
or form because of the way

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.448 align:middle line:84%
their energy
resonates into our--

00:05:52.448 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This dimension.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Exactly.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:84%
But what was also
really fascinating

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
about the questions
that were being

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:84%
asked during this
hypnotic regression--

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:84%
one of the questions, of
course, where are you from?

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And the response was,
I'm from another space.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
The follow-up to that was, do
you mean another dimension?

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And the response was, well, you
may call it another dimension

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:90%
but really, it's another space.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of cryptic.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But it leads you to
believe there's something

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:84%
deeper than our current
understanding of what

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:90%
dimensions are.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So in talking with Lee Harris,
who has a new book out,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:90%
"Talking With the Z's," right?

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
They're explaining-- the
person, Dianna Edwards,

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.140 align:middle line:90%
asked the questions there.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
They're asking the Z's,
this group of beings,

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:90%
about dimensions.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:90%
And could you please--

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:84%
we don't really
fully get it here.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was very interesting
because they set up

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:84%
an architecture of how
dimensions, planes,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and realms work and intersect.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
That's not our
current understanding.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:84%
We just kind of see
them as kind of pancakes

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.540 align:middle line:90%
of higher and lower.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
it's interesting you

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:90%
said that it's another space.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
They would probably have said,
it's another localized realm.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is all now semantics at
this point that he was seeing,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.840 align:middle line:90%
which is quite interesting.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I think these
conversations are good.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.510 align:middle line:84%
It's helping us understand the
nature of the reality that's

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.743 align:middle line:84%
around us and permeating
us all the time.

00:07:24.743 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Exactly.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely more going
on around us than we perceive.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Human perception-- we can
only see with our eyes

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:90%
into a certain wavelengths.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
We can only hear into
certain wavelengths.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Our body resonates
between a 9 and 16 hertz.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a resonance that's limited.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's so
much more out there

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that every once in a while we
get this little glimpse of.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what some
of these shadows are.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So beyond the shadows, you're
talking about these could be--

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:84%
he said I'm from
a different space.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:90%
They could be also--

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:84%
there are shadow
people of other forms.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
some of the other kind

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.173 align:middle line:84%
of quirky ones like
the hat people,

00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and black-eyed children and
all that a little later.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But these can be from other
places, other planets, that can

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:90%
phase in, shift frequencies.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:84%
They can be from other
dimensions, right?

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.782 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:08:18.782 --> 00:08:19.582 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:84%
They could absolutely
be from other planets.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Some of these are certainly ETs.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
ultra-terrestrial, something

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:84%
that's actually here indigenous
to Earth that are just from,

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
again, what we would
call another dimension.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Some of these are
actually time slips,

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
where we're seeing another
point in time that's permeating

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.259 align:middle line:90%
through to this time.

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So that means that we need
to start embracing the fact

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:84%
that Earth itself
is multidimensional.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're the Earth species
for the third/fourth dimension.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
There are many
other species that

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.058 align:middle line:84%
are of Earth in her
other dimensions, right?

00:08:58.058 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:84%
There are, in our theoretical
physics, up to 11 dimensions.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think we fail
to ask the question,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
are there other beings
and entities living

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:90%
within these other dimensions?

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.468 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I would
say absolutely yes.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.920 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And if you
look at it from,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:84%
say, from the hermetic
point of view, they'll say

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
there are the seven realms--
the three above Earth, the three

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:90%
below.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Others will say six
above, six below.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:90%
So this gets interesting.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.297 align:middle line:84%
And I'm having fun
kind of talking

00:09:27.297 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:84%
with a few different people
sitting in front of me

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
We're really comfortable
with the notion

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
that we have bleed-throughs
from guides and angels.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.747 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my angel told me this.

00:09:36.747 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I can feel them on my
shoulder, and I just love it

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.872 align:middle line:90%
when they're in the room.

00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:90%
We're cool with that, right?

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
But we're not so cool when
someone bleeds in from what

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:90%
you would call realms below.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say other spaces
that don't feel as cozy.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the notion of the realm

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:84%
just below Earth, below this
frequency going into a second,

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:84%
into low third
dimensional frequency,

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:90%
and some of the beings there.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about some
of these other beings that

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
are coming from some of
these other dimensions,

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:84%
we get this perception
of OK, they may be dark.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And just because they
are dark in nature

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
does not mean that their
intentions are dark.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:90%
We are getting only--

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
I guess a good
way to put this is

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
we may be dealing with
several different species that

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.190 align:middle line:84%
are using a same energetic
modality to enter

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:84%
into our plane of
existence here on Earth.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.947 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:10:35.947 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well said.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Thank you.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
We do a disservice
when we think,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, something is from
a lower vibration,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:84%
something is from a lower
realm, so therefore, we

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:84%
have to cast it off as
evil, nasty, nefarious.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.135 align:middle line:84%
Let's actually get to
know some of these beings

00:10:52.135 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
entities and find out

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:90%
what exactly they may be.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:90%
What's their intention?

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Are they just curious about us?

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Do they have some ulterior
motive here on Earth?

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's find out.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's ask the questions.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.882 align:middle line:90%
Very well said.

00:11:06.882 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And that brings up a few
different things, of course.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:90%
So if we're looking at--

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's a book.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a highly esoteric book,
that virtually no one knows of,

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.755 align:middle line:84%
called "The Golden
Star," by Jean Michaud.

00:11:19.755 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:84%
He was a mystical writer
in the 1930s and '40s,

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:90%
absolutely brilliant.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.885 align:middle line:90%
And this book is taking--

00:11:30.885 --> 00:11:33.960 align:middle line:84%
a wise being is taking a
little boy and a little girl

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:90%
on a tour of the realms--

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
seven realms-- and
Earth is in the middle.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about it is you

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:84%
do have the thundering, roaring,
burning, and destructive lower

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:84%
frequencies on one end, and
the, essentially, heavenly

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.400 align:middle line:84%
kind of frequencies on the
other, and everything in

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:90%
between.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:84%
But what's said is that
all of these go together.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.780 align:middle line:84%
These all influence each other
and play a part in the whole.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
As humans live in
the middle band,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're to learn from
all of these realms.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So like you say, it may not
be someone in a second realm

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:90%
may have evil intentions.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But it might be that
their means of survival

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of
consumption and usury.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:90%
That's how they survive.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So if they bleed over here we're
thinking, oh, how dare you?

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.200 align:middle line:84%
That's horrible
what you just did.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But for them, that's
where they live and work

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's what survival means
there, just like survival

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:84%
on our plane, with
all the wars, can

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.340 align:middle line:84%
look pretty darn ugly to the
higher planes of Earth beings.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have, of course, the
whole idea as above so below.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So you have this duality
within our universe.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.495 align:middle line:90%
And everything's connected.

00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a different
dimension, different plane

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
of existence, the seven
realms, everything

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.555 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely connected even
from Earth out into the cosmos.

00:12:57.555 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's another thing
that we don't usually consider.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about
extraterrestrials.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And we always think of some
physical craft coming here

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:90%
to Earth.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if some
other intelligent beings

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that are out there have learned
some of the different things

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.523 align:middle line:84%
that we've been trying
to do here on Earth,

00:13:14.523 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:84%
like astral projection,
these sorts of things.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Are they able to project
their consciousness

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:84%
across the cosmos, maybe
even interdimensionally

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.025 align:middle line:90%
to manifest here on Earth?

00:13:24.025 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I think that's very true.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just say
a little anecdote.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:84%
We had a shadow
person in our house.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:90%
It was a tall man, male.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:90%
It looked male.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.087 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it didn't have--
it didn't look female

00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:90%
in its proportions.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.073 align:middle line:84%
But it was a shadow, just
like what you described.

00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And it frightened my son because
he was only three-and-a-half

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and he saw him while
he was in the bathroom.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.840 align:middle line:90%
And I just said, he's OK, honey.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:84%
He's just a visitor, and
don't worry about it.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.020 align:middle line:84%
But he used to, at
night, push our little--

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
we had a silk tree for
decoration in the living room.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I'd wake up in the morning
when we used to see the fellow,

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.870 align:middle line:90%
and it was pushed over.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, and
I'd just pick it back up.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.562 align:middle line:84%
But one day, I left the
house and left the water on.

00:14:04.562 --> 00:14:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was going to be
on for a very long time.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.225 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh
my god, the place

00:14:08.225 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:84%
is going to be flooded
when I get back.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I got back, the
water had been turned off.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:90%
No neighbor.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:90%
No landlord.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.657 align:middle line:90%
The water was off.

00:14:15.657 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:90%
And so I just thanked him.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
He didn't stay around much
longer, but he helped us out.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.780 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was him.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:22.813 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:22.813 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: There are more
of these lighthearted stories

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:84%
about shadow entities that
people don't really consider.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
They think more of
the dark nature.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But I mentioned earlier
about the incident

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:84%
that I had when I
was a child, which

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:90%
seems to be on the outset.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:84%
A little scarier in
nature, but turned out

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.390 align:middle line:84%
not to be when you found
out the intentions.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But there was another
incident that I

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:90%
had when I was a teenager.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:84%
We had moved from that
house in Massachusetts

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:90%
to a new house in Ohio.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And as I was unpacking boxes
and putting things away,

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I kept seeing this
shadowy figure

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:90%
in the doorway of my bedroom.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And every time I turned and
looked, it would take off.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:90%
It would run off down the hall.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't fully formed
like that other one

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:90%
that I saw when I was a child.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:90%
It was a little bit different.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:90%
It was more translucent.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very fast.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And this went on
for several days

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.153 align:middle line:84%
where I'd be unpacking
boxes, putting things away.

00:15:13.153 --> 00:15:15.153 align:middle line:84%
And I'd see the figure
standing into my doorway.

00:15:15.153 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'd turn and
look, and off it goes.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So finally, I decided to
ask my mother about it.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when I told
her what I was seeing,

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
she actually admitted to me she
had been seeing the same thing

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:84%
too, which was great for me for
a couple of different reasons.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:84%
One, it's an affirmation
that I'm not crazy.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Mom is seeing this as well.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And two, she didn't
seem alarmed about it.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.970 align:middle line:84%
She was rather nonchalant
about the whole thing.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, OK, so mom's
not alarmed about it either,

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.610 align:middle line:84%
there's no reason for me
to be scared about it.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:90%
So I got playful with it.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And I started calling
him Tom, like peeping Tom

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:90%
because he'd peep in my room.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And any time after
that, I'd say, hi, Tom.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:90%
And off he'd go.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So there are more of
these lighthearted stories

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
out there than people
really give credit for.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And again by this time
you're not afraid of it.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And that really
changes the nature

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:84%
of what the connection
is going to be also.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And so let me ask
you this, and then I

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.373 align:middle line:84%
want to go to the hat man
and then the hooded figure.

00:16:10.373 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Because this is kind of fun.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.430 align:middle line:90%
People like this.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:90%
What about the mantis people?

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard anything
of the mantis people?

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well,
it's interesting.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So I have heard of
the mantis people

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily
in a connection

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:90%
with shadow entities.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So mantis people-- more of
these beings that are living

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:90%
underground, that sort of thing.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
You see connections
of the mantis people

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.300 align:middle line:84%
back into the American
Southwest, Montezuma's Well,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:90%
which is really fascinating.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:84%
The origin stories to some
different Indigenous peoples

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:90%
of the area.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:90%
And so who are those people?

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Are they really-- are they
sentient beings like us?

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Or are they crossing over
from some other dimension?

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So I guess that would
be the connection there.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.407 align:middle line:84%
Some sort of interdimensional
tie-in to it all.

00:16:55.407 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To it all.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the hat man.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: OK.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the hat man.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.470 align:middle line:90%
These hat-wearing entities.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cause a lot of people
think they're the men in black.

00:17:06.895 --> 00:17:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:12.878 align:middle line:84%
And you go back to
the early 1950s,

00:17:12.878 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:84%
if you'll allow me
to tell the story.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, please.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Albert K. Bender,
who founded the International

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:21.829 align:middle line:84%
Flying Saucer Bureau in
1952 during the big UFO

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:90%
flap that year.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.535 align:middle line:84%
And within that first year, he
blew that organization up big.

00:17:26.535 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:90%
It was international.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
There's offices in
the UK and Australia.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is before
we had the internet

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:90%
and long-distance phone calls.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.908 align:middle line:84%
You weren't making those
until after 9:00 PM

00:17:37.908 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:90%
so that the charges were lower.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So it was a lot
more difficult to be

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
able to create a large
organization like that

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:90%
internationally.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:90%
But he did.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, a year later,

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:90%
he disbanded the entire thing.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And for awhile, people
thought that there

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:84%
was some sort of intervention
by the men in black.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't really getting
very detailed about what

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:90%
exactly happened.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.047 align:middle line:84%
He worked a little
bit with Gray Barker.

00:18:03.047 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Gray Barker published a
book giving his suspicions

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:84%
about the men in
black were involved.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Finally, in the 1960s,
Albert K. Bender

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:84%
published a book "Flying
Saucers and the Three Men,"

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:90%
and explained what happened.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And so he tells a
fascinating story

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:90%
about how he came home one day.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And through the
wall in his bedroom

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:84%
were these three dark,
shadowy, hat-wearing entities

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:84%
with glowing eyes,
smelling of sulfur that

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.260 align:middle line:90%
told him he needed to stop.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.775 align:middle line:84%
And I hear the story
and I'm thinking, OK,

00:18:33.775 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
this is something
paranormal in nature.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:90%
These are these shadow entities.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Bender said, well
these were actually

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials
that had established

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:90%
a base in Antarctica.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were here
harvesting resources

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
for a period of 15 years and
told him not talk about it

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:90%
until they had left Earth.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Other people hear the
story and they say,

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:90%
these are the men in black.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So it makes you wonder,
are we really talking

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:90%
about the same thing here?

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because, often, men
in black is also men in gray.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:84%
It's government representatives
who keep a lid on things

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and go around and do the
cleanup after events,

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.595 align:middle line:84%
and the perception management,
and so forth, which are humans.

00:19:11.595 --> 00:19:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Governmental humans--

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.053 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: There
are those people--

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --from agencies and
shadow aspects of agencies.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about two
completely different things,

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: We are.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.097 align:middle line:90%
I used to work for the NSA.

00:19:22.097 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I know some of those guys.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:24.932 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:24.932 --> 00:19:28.280 align:middle line:84%
You brought up the sulfur smell
and it just sparked a memory.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So another house of mine--
old house in Sacramento,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:90%
in the old part of town--

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.925 align:middle line:84%
there's this little
cylindrical area

00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the living room.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And my son and I
both experienced it.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:90%
We called him the garbage man.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And we walked in and
you just said it,

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:84%
it smelled like sulfur
and garbage burning.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Oh, fascinating.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.217 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
would walk through it,

00:19:51.217 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and it was only 3 or
4 feet in diameter.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you'd be on
the other side of it.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And my son would walk through,
or friends, other people

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:90%
go through.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.482 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they noticed
it, but we both did and say, oh,

00:20:04.482 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:90%
the garbage man's here.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And he would just stand.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.930 align:middle line:84%
He would just stand in one
place, didn't do anything,

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:90%
just really smelled horrible.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And things like that
are fascinating where

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.960 align:middle line:84%
whatever energy is
manifesting in that moment

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
will affect several of
our different senses.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And the olfactory
senses are ones that

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:90%
can be affected by this energy.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go to
the hooded figures.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yes.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because this is
a little different story.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:90%
There is a mixture here.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.260 align:middle line:84%
There are stories of
hooded figures doing things

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.020 align:middle line:84%
that are little more nefarious
in nature, like pulling

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
somebody up by the
ankles off of a bed.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that story
before, and it's like, OK.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:84%
But the same exact
person who told

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:84%
me that story that
happened to her

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.290 align:middle line:84%
told another even
more fascinating story

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.390 align:middle line:90%
about her young son.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:84%
He was very sickly
child when he was young.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And she kept seeing
a dark hooded figure

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.233 align:middle line:90%
go into his bedroom.

00:21:02.233 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:84%
She'd just see it going
down the hall into his room.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And she thought it was a
harbinger of death at first.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.050 align:middle line:84%
She was like, he's going
to be taken here soon.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to the
doctor on a consistent basis

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.660 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what was
going on with their son.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
particular day where they

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:90%
went to the doctor's office.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were basically going
to run the same battery of tests

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, the
doctor turned his head

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
as if somebody was
whispering into his ear,

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:84%
turned back around to the
husband and wife and said,

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
you know what, let's
try these other tests

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and see if we can figure
something else out here.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
They deduced that it was
actually a different illness,

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:90%
something that was treatable.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:90%
The boy turned out fine.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
They never saw the
hooded figure again.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.063 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I believe
it was that hooded figure,

00:21:45.063 --> 00:21:47.480 align:middle line:84%
even though I couldn't see him
in the room with the doctor

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.647 align:middle line:84%
at that time, I believe
that he was there whispering

00:21:49.647 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:90%
to the doctor what to do.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
hooded figure that

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:90%
was benevolent in this case.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I love these stories
because, again, we

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
associate light with
right and dark with wrong.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that goes into
the roots of our language.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: It does.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:84%
But you hear these stories
like hospital deathbed scene.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.890 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes you'll
hear a story of light

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:10%
beams coming and surrounding
the person in their bed.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
You also hear sometimes
of, oh, there's

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
a darker presence that's
there and maybe a shadow

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:90%
person by the bed.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And the loved ones would
be like, oh, no, they're

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.910 align:middle line:90%
going to the bad place.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But we don't, again, think
of the way we perceive

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:90%
light-- you mentioned earlier.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:84%
We only see light in
a certain wavelength.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So it could possibly be that
we are seeing the bodily form

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:90%
of whatever that entity is.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And the light
emanating from it is so

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.997 align:middle line:90%
beyond our visual perception--

00:22:46.997 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That it looks
like a void, almost.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.538 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
it looks like a void.

00:22:50.538 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And I don't recommend
people to actually do this,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.433 align:middle line:84%
but what happens when you
stare at a light bulb too long?

00:22:55.433 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:90%
You no longer see the light.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:84%
You just see this dark
silhouette of the bulb.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Don't
do that, please.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.660 align:middle line:90%
No, that's a very good point.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a prejudice
in that way about forms,

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.647 align:middle line:84%
non-physical forms, in
terms of the hue, right?

00:23:10.647 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the
black-eyed children.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: OK.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Again--

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that
creeps a lot of people out.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:20.615 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: They're
really creepy.

00:23:20.615 --> 00:23:21.415 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:21.415 --> 00:23:22.445 align:middle line:90%
They are really creepy.

00:23:22.445 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Those are creepy.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, I don't
believe that they are actually

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:90%
shadow people.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, I think a
connection because I

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.417 align:middle line:84%
believe they are some sort
of interdimensional being

00:23:30.417 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:90%
or ultra-terrestrial.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
The differences here being
that with shadow people,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:90%
you don't see facial features.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.537 align:middle line:90%
Black-eyed children, you do.

00:23:38.537 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
most disconcerting thing

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.170 align:middle line:90%
are the black eyes.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:90%
We see full facial features.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:47.088 align:middle line:84%
You see clothing
that's very distinct.

00:23:47.088 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is the clothing?

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: The clothing--
it's very drab in nature,

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:90%
usually, kind of grey tones.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They may be wearing a
little bit of black,

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:90%
but it's usually off-white drab.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.940 align:middle line:84%
They talk in a very monotone
voice, which is another thing.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
The black-eyed
children are verbally

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
speaking through their mouth,
while with shadow entities,

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:84%
most people don't
actually hear a voice.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that do, claim that
it's something more telepathic

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.560 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.435 align:middle line:84%
Something it's more of
a thought transference

00:24:16.435 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:90%
rather than verbal.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.380 align:middle line:90%
So that's very different.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Also shadow entities,
you freely move about.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
They're in and out
of your home at will,

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.327 align:middle line:84%
where black-eyed children
have to be invited in.

00:24:29.327 --> 00:24:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I find
that part interesting

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
because they'll find
sometimes a clever way

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
to get invited in, almost a
manipulation into being invited

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Has anyone figured out
why whatever the standards

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:46.168 align:middle line:84%
they're working by
require an invitation?

00:24:46.168 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: It is a
question that I don't think

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.575 align:middle line:90%
anybody's really figured out.

00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:51.660 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] You hear
like some vampire

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:84%
lore that vampires
need to be invited in.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:90%
So is it the same sort of thing?

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Is it a cultural
thing like that?

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we've
really figured that out.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But you do hear
some stories of when

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.320 align:middle line:84%
one is invited in-- they
can also approach a car

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and be invited into a car, which
is another fascinating topic.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:84%
But terrible things seem
to happen following that.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:84%
People have gotten into car
accidents or terrible things

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:18.888 align:middle line:84%
happen at home,
that sort of thing.

00:25:18.888 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why people say,
don't invite them in.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.095 align:middle line:90%
Well, so there's a warning.

00:25:23.095 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't invite them in.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But you say that
their prevalence is

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.342 align:middle line:90%
a little bit on the increase?

00:25:28.342 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: It seems to be.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:84%
You hear more of the
stories that are starting

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.190 align:middle line:90%
to enter into our lexicon.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is, we have more
people in the world today.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So more people are going
to report experiences.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe
that because people

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.670 align:middle line:84%
are more open to talking about
these subjects these days.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day,
it was very taboo.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.750 align:middle line:84%
If you talked about
these sorts of things,

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.720 align:middle line:84%
you may find yourself in
a straitjacket somewhere

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.290 align:middle line:90%
and put away.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But these days,
with the internet,

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.250 align:middle line:84%
with the various television
shows that are out there--

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:84%
this show right
here, "Open Minds,"

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.275 align:middle line:84%
where it helps people to become
more comfortable with talking

00:26:08.275 --> 00:26:09.900 align:middle line:84%
about these subjects,
like, oh, I'm not

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.880 align:middle line:90%
the only one experiencing this.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Other people are
experiencing this too.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell my story.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.767 align:middle line:84%
So I think that plays
into it as well.

00:26:17.767 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the
notion that you've talked about

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:84%
before that some of these
are projections of ourselves,

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:90%
of our own consciousness?

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yes.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a variety of different
ways this can happen.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:90%
One, astral projection.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I talked a little bit
about that earlier.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Are extraterrestrials
projecting themselves here?

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.778 align:middle line:90%
Well, what about ourselves?

00:26:38.778 --> 00:26:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Plenty of people know how to
astral project these days.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And the example I like to
give is take a grandmother who

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
lives 500 or 1,000 miles
away from her daughter

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and her granddaughter
wants to go visit,

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.190 align:middle line:90%
knows how to astral project.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So maybe she's meditating
at night, projects

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:90%
to go visit her daughter--

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.057 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unbeknownst to her
and unbeknownst to all parties.

00:26:58.057 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.213 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to her daughter
and her granddaughter.

00:27:01.213 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Goes into her room
at night, looks down,

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.860 align:middle line:84%
well, there's my
daughter sleeping.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Goes into the
granddaughter's room,

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.913 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's my
granddaughter sleeping.

00:27:07.913 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the granddaughter wakes
up and sees-- what does she see?

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It's energy
consciousness that has

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.290 align:middle line:90%
been projected into the room.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Does it show up as a shadow?

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.248 align:middle line:84%
Does it show up into--
some people report

00:27:17.248 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:90%
seeing a shimmer-type person?

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
How does that energy
manifest in the room?

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there
is a direct entanglement

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:90%
through love and emotions.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Love is quantifiable.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that can actually

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:84%
allow for that manifestation,
even though that's not

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.140 align:middle line:84%
the intention on the
part of the person who

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:84%
is wishing to see
their granddaughter

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:90%
or the one on the receiving end.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.085 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
that can manifest

00:27:40.085 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
through that
entanglement of love

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and the power and magnetism
of those emotions.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Even going back to my
very first experience.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:52.530 align:middle line:84%
That entity wasn't
intended to be seen.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:58.170 align:middle line:84%
But its energy permeated through
whatever its true intentions

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
were, which I
believe now was just

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.220 align:middle line:90%
some sort of research mission.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.180 align:middle line:84%
But with an astral
projection, love, intention,

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:10.920 align:middle line:84%
that energy does bleed through
from one dimension to another.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And another
fascinating topic when

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.020 align:middle line:84%
we look at this,
dealing with shadows,

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.020 align:middle line:84%
are time slips, something
that can bleed through

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:90%
from another moment in time.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So I personally believe time is
all concurrent-- past, present,

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.220 align:middle line:84%
future, all happening
at the same time.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard some
fascinating stories

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that some people
would consider them

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:90%
like a doppelganger-type story.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a fascinating story by
the famous German poet, Goethe,

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:84%
where he talks
about, essentially,

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.650 align:middle line:84%
seeing himself walking down
the street from the other side.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Not realizing at first,
but years later realizing,

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.845 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute, that was myself.

00:28:45.845 --> 00:28:47.595 align:middle line:84%
But people would call
that a doppelganger.

00:28:47.595 --> 00:28:48.270 align:middle line:90%
It was not.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.500 align:middle line:90%
It's some sort of time slip.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And a story that was related
to me a couple of years

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
ago now was this young man,
when he was a small child,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.260 align:middle line:84%
had walked into the kitchen,
saw a tall, dark, hooded figure

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.940 align:middle line:90%
standing by the kitchen table.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Scared him to death.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.525 align:middle line:90%
He ran out of the room.

00:29:05.525 --> 00:29:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Years later, he's
in the kitchen.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.158 align:middle line:90%
He's at the table.

00:29:08.158 --> 00:29:09.450 align:middle line:90%
He's making himself a sandwich.

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.722 align:middle line:90%
He's wearing a hoodie.

00:29:10.722 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
in the doorway,

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:84%
he sees this smaller shadow
person walk into the room,

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.620 align:middle line:90%
and then run back out.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:90%
And it hits him.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute, that was me.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.970 align:middle line:90%
So what happened there?

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It was some sort
of slip in time.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And it only manifested itself as
a shadow, not as any full being

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:90%
in that moment.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so fascinating.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just that part
there gives us something

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:33.450 align:middle line:90%
to think about.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.750 align:middle line:84%
That and the other one about
the projection of consciousness

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:84%
through desire or
love or whatnot.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.423 align:middle line:84%
So we can spend
some time after this

00:29:41.423 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:84%
just over thinking
about all that.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
is fascinating.

00:29:44.647 --> 00:29:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this stuff happens
in more energetically charged

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:90%
places in the world.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows about
the Bermuda Triangle and such

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:90%
and what's happened there.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we may not
understand the full dynamics

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.930 align:middle line:84%
of what has happened,
but the things do happen.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Same thing in the
Alaska Triangle.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And you've written
about this extensively.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about these energized
places and introduce us

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:09.820 align:middle line:90%
to the Alaska Triangle.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
You have these amazing places
in the world, very volatile

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:90%
in nature, a lot of energy--

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Bermuda Triangle,
Alaska Triangle,

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Dragon Triangle by Japan.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.970 align:middle line:84%
With Alaska, it's like
this really full cocktail

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:90%
of different energies.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
Earth's magnetism,

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that vortex energy rising
up out of the ground,

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.200 align:middle line:84%
interacting with
different minerals

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:84%
within the ground that
creates this type of energy.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the US Department
of the Interior in the 1960s--

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.990 align:middle line:84%
it was only 100,000 square
miles that they were actually

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.200 align:middle line:84%
to survey because Alaska
is very remote and desolate

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:90%
in many areas.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But within that, they discovered
five magnetic characters,

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.450 align:middle line:90%
is what they called it.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And within those
different characters,

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:84%
they had what they described
as negative anomalies, which

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.270 align:middle line:84%
basically adhered to this
idea of energetic pockets

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.010 align:middle line:84%
that would create
different disturbances.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.000 align:middle line:90%
So you have that.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.190 align:middle line:84%
You have the seismic
energy that's there

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:90%
from all of the earthquakes.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:84%
The largest earthquake that
ever happened on this continent,

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.150 align:middle line:84%
at least that we
were able to measure,

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:84%
happened there in
Anchorage, Alaska.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.750 align:middle line:90%
You have volcanic activity.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:84%
That energy that's
there within Alaska.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.740 align:middle line:84%
You also have solar flares
that are pounding the area,

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.270 align:middle line:90%
as well as the aurora borealis.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So all of this energy
creating a myriad of different

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:30.970 align:middle line:90%
anomalies that happen there.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
does happen to be

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:84%
shadow activity, which
I witnessed there

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.570 align:middle line:90%
when I was working.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I was enlisted in the
United States Air Force

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:84%
working in the basement of
the Alaska command building.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And we saw several
shadows moving

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:84%
in and about the
communication center

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.500 align:middle line:84%
down there, mostly in
the back office area.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
some of the military activity,

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.940 align:middle line:90%
missing flights, missing bombs.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.208 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about some of that.

00:31:56.208 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Some very-- they're sad tales.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.260 align:middle line:84%
The families of these people
never saw their loved ones

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.160 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
famous flights that

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:84%
went missing in 1950, which
was a Douglas Skymaster.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.920 align:middle line:90%
44 people went missing in that.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It was a January
day, perfectly fine.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.730 align:middle line:90%
No terrible weather.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And as the flight was crossing
over Alaska into Canada,

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.917 align:middle line:84%
into the Yukon territory, it
just completely disappeared off

00:32:27.917 --> 00:32:28.750 align:middle line:90%
the face of the map.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows whatever
happened to it.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So the larger search and
rescue mission at that time

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.450 align:middle line:90%
was put together.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:37.690 align:middle line:84%
There were American
and Canadian troops

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that were running joint
exercises at that time.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:84%
They called thousands
of soldiers off of those

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.270 align:middle line:84%
exercises to go out
there and search.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of hours of flight
time to search overhead.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was ever found.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And what's ironic-- a
couple of different things.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.990 align:middle line:84%
One, about four
weeks later, there

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:59.680 align:middle line:84%
was a smaller flight that went
down around that same area

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.590 align:middle line:84%
where the Skymaster was
supposed to have disappeared.

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.040 align:middle line:90%
They found that immediately.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Not a problem.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Here's this larger
plane still missing.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And then also just before
the Douglas Skymaster

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.665 align:middle line:84%
went missing and just after it,
were a couple of UFO sightings.

00:33:13.665 --> 00:33:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to bring up.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So this sounds to me as
though there would be

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.430 align:middle line:90%
UFO activity at the same time.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.830 align:middle line:90%
So we're looking at--

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's cold comfort.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
But the notion that perhaps this
craft was taken into another

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and taken for a
reason elsewhere,

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and that those people may
actually still exist for all we

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.860 align:middle line:84%
That's the cold
comfort part of it,

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.470 align:middle line:84%
if you can wrap your
mind around anomalies,

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.243 align:middle line:90%
is that, yes, we've lost them.

00:33:43.243 --> 00:33:44.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to see them again.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.560 align:middle line:84%
But they may be alive
and well in another place

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:84%
under the care of some
other species even perhaps.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.203 align:middle line:84%
And this happened also not
just there but also to boats?

00:33:55.203 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: It
happens to boats.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Boats will go missing.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.058 align:middle line:84%
You see that a lot in
the Bermuda Triangle.

00:34:02.058 --> 00:34:03.100 align:middle line:90%
There's more water there.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:05.463 align:middle line:90%
Boats going missing.

00:34:05.463 --> 00:34:06.880 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
thing that I found

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:84%
interesting in
researching for this

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:13.840 align:middle line:84%
is, you say since 1988,
16,000 people have gone

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.357 align:middle line:90%
missing in the Alaska Triangle.

00:34:16.357 --> 00:34:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: It's an
extremely high number.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.260 align:middle line:84%
You think about the
population of Alaska.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.929 align:middle line:84%
It's around the same population
as the city of San Francisco.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:23.929 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very low pop--

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:24.985 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: So if you
were to say 16,000--

00:34:24.985 --> 00:34:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
very unpopulated.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.628 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: --people went
missing in San Francisco.

00:34:27.628 --> 00:34:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.460 align:middle line:90%
And some of these are--

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.530 align:middle line:90%
they're in broad daylight.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.380 align:middle line:84%
About 10 years ago, during
the Mount Marathon Race,

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.080 align:middle line:84%
which is there in
Seward, Alaska--

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.620 align:middle line:84%
very public event--
and one individual

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:84%
went up the mountain,
never came back down.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It just disappeared in
front of all these people.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Scores of people went up looking
for did he fall off the path?

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:90%
No body was ever found.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:54.209 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:34:54.209 --> 00:34:56.830 align:middle line:84%
It just disappeared in the
middle of a very public race.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So this brings up
another whole potential.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And that is, if we
could look at the soul

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.710 align:middle line:84%
source of the people on Earth,
we're from all over the place.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:90%
We're hybrid species.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.550 align:middle line:84%
We're basically a
mixed bag of entities

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:18.540 align:middle line:84%
from all over the cosmos
who incarnate as human.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And so if that's the case, I've
often considered the notion

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.035 align:middle line:84%
that it's like when you
talk about abduction cases

00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and so forth,
because that's also

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.210 align:middle line:90%
a mixed bag for most people.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:34.530 align:middle line:84%
That there may be an
agreement between this soul

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and some of their own people
from where they had originally

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.260 align:middle line:84%
been or had been before
to do some work together,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.420 align:middle line:84%
to collaborate,
do some research,

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:84%
even come back and have your
body diagnosed and so forth,

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.660 align:middle line:90%
what's going on Earth.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
there are occasions

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.800 align:middle line:84%
where there is
actually collaboration

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.620 align:middle line:84%
between the people that are
quote, "abducted and disappear"

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and whatever beings
may have taken them up.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.890 align:middle line:84%
That it's not always
without consent

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:05.520 align:middle line:84%
on at least a soul level,
if not a conscious level.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Because what were we
before we were here?

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.103 align:middle line:90%
We're from all over.

00:36:13.103 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: We're
from everywhere.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I kind of refer to
it as the home world.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:84%
But what have we agreed to
before we came down here?

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: So there may
be a contract in place,

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.340 align:middle line:84%
like you were saying,
that at some point maybe

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.740 align:middle line:90%
we'll be taken off to the side.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Some of these disappearance
cases, people do reappear.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And they tell some
interesting stories

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.357 align:middle line:84%
how they were on the path
walking through the woods,

00:36:36.357 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:84%
heard something off to
the side of the path,

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:40.560 align:middle line:84%
went to take a look, took
two steps off the path,

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.628 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden,
the path was gone.

00:36:43.628 --> 00:36:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're out in the
middle of the woods,

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of nowhere.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:90%
How did they get there?

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, they're found.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But where did they
go in the interim?

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Was there some sort of
agreement already in place

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.702 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and have
some investigation done?

00:36:59.702 --> 00:37:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
think it's all hostile.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: No.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's
not as though there

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.240 align:middle line:84%
aren't some entities
with untoward motives

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.170 align:middle line:90%
towards humanity.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:07.980 align:middle line:90%
I think there are.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I think we can all even
witness that day to day.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.760 align:middle line:84%
We can also witness
it within our species.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
hold the same--

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.300 align:middle line:84%
would you call it standard
for other species,

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be holding
us up very high

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.942 align:middle line:84%
as the human species in
terms of motives with some

00:37:26.942 --> 00:37:28.150 align:middle line:90%
of the people on this planet.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So I do think that
it is possible.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to bring
that up that I don't think

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.680 align:middle line:84%
all abductions and
all missing people are

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.930 align:middle line:84%
without some kind
of a soul design,

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.870 align:middle line:84%
though I'm sure
some probably are.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Some are caught off
guard and by surprise.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Absolutely.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:41.650 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I say.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.050 align:middle line:90%
It's very simplistic in nature.

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I say this a lot when it
comes to the shadow entities,

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.490 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people think
they're dark, evil, nefarious.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:49.290 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe these
entities, whether it's

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:54.300 align:middle line:84%
a shadow entity, or an
ET, or what have you,

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:90%
that they're like humans.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Some humans are good.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Some humans are bad.

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Some of these other
beings are good.

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are bad.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.360 align:middle line:90%
You're going to have this mix.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a
matter of trying

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:09.918 align:middle line:84%
to figure out, investigate,
and discern, which is which.

00:38:09.918 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think we're at a time

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.560 align:middle line:84%
now, a crossroads
in our own history,

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.890 align:middle line:84%
where we're going through a
type of evolution as a species.

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that-- and
for the better, definitely.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But we are the
subject of curiosity,

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I think, of a lot of
species within our cosmos

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:30.840 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
normal in a certain way.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:90%
We are so hybridized.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.640 align:middle line:90%
We do have free will.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.440 align:middle line:84%
We are working with each
other, for each other,

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.430 align:middle line:90%
against each other.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing every kind
of possible manifestation

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:42.030 align:middle line:90%
of free will.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
of extreme interest.

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Not only that-- what happens
if unwise decisions are

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.920 align:middle line:84%
made regarding your
host planet and you

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.770 align:middle line:90%
start creating toxicities?

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.680 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be a
concern of most ETs

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that show up everywhere is this
toxicification of our planet

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and thus consuming these
foods from a toxic planet--

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.620 align:middle line:90%
water, air, et cetera.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.117 align:middle line:84%
What that's doing to the
development of the human being?

00:39:07.117 --> 00:39:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we may actually be
some sort of test bed planet.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, what happens if
given a certain situation--

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:16.970 align:middle line:84%
because I don't believe
we're originally from here.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:84%
We're different than every
other animal on this planet.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So where did we
originally come from?

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And are we a lost colony?

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Are we a test bed?

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.230 align:middle line:84%
What is actually going
on with our planet?

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But yes the rest of the cosmos
are very, very interested

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.050 align:middle line:90%
in what we're doing here.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And so for that reason, they're
observing, and sometimes taking

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.340 align:middle line:84%
people, and sometimes
not giving them back.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And then some hybridized
programs going on out there,

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:45.510 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
definitely a mixed bag.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to plant
the notion, the seed,

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that not all of it is as
hostile and dark as we tend

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to think it is because we
don't understand it consciously

00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.462 align:middle line:90%
in the moment.

00:39:59.462 --> 00:40:01.170 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I wanted
to ask you about--

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.212 align:middle line:84%
I have written down here
and didn't-- and this is

00:40:03.212 --> 00:40:05.850 align:middle line:84%
interesting because this
has been done before,

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:90%
a nuclear bomb also disappeared.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:10.660 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.717 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 12 of 17 people on
that plane were recovered too.

00:40:13.717 --> 00:40:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: There are
others that are missing.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.810 align:middle line:90%
This also happened in 1950.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It was coming out of
Eielson Air Force Base.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And en route-- basically, it
was over the Pacific Ocean

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.910 align:middle line:84%
not too far from
the Juneau area.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And the plane started
malfunctioning.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And they had the
nuclear bomb on board.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they
were doing a test

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:41.700 align:middle line:84%
run to see how far they could
go with a nuclear bomb on board

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.420 align:middle line:90%
because of Russia.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.880 align:middle line:90%
So they're doing a test.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Plane starts malfunctioning and
they need to ditch the bomb.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And they actually had some
issues with discharging it.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.842 align:middle line:84%
And they claim, well,
it wasn't really armed.

00:40:54.842 --> 00:40:57.300 align:middle line:84%
But basically, you have a bomb
that dropped into the ocean.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.350 align:middle line:90%
That's still down there.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:40:59.850 align:middle line:90%
It's never been recovered.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.880 align:middle line:84%
The plane itself, they
didn't find for years.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:84%
They finally found it in Canada
on the side of a mountain.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, only 12 of 17 of the
personnel were ever recovered.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a bizarre incident.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are
you still looking

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.020 align:middle line:84%
into what's going on
at the Alaska Triangle?

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Oh, absolutely.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So anything since your report,
since you've written your book,

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.090 align:middle line:84%
just before we sign off here,
some of the juiciest cases,

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.090 align:middle line:84%
a couple of the juiciest
things happening right now.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Oh.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.500 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is
a lot of the research

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing
there is more--

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.850 align:middle line:84%
it dives into the past,
although you can--

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:43.380 align:middle line:84%
what I'm interested in is tying
what's going on in present day

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.430 align:middle line:90%
to the past.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Doing the forensics.

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Right.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.380 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Doing the forensics.

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've been really interested
in some of these stories

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually
tie from Alaska back

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.435 align:middle line:90%
to the ancient world.

00:41:55.435 --> 00:41:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
really understand this

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.845 align:middle line:84%
that giants have been
found in Alaska and--

00:42:01.845 --> 00:42:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're all over.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.133 align:middle line:90%
They're all over.

00:42:04.133 --> 00:42:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But people don't
ever really think

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:07.270 align:middle line:84%
of Alaska giants,
these sorts of things.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And you look back into
some of the old tales that

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.140 align:middle line:84%
were passed down through
the Inuit culture

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:19.280 align:middle line:84%
that they are very reminiscent
of the whole begetting

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.500 align:middle line:84%
of the nepheline
and the giant race.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And what are these
stories doing in Alaska?

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been working with a
couple of individuals, natives

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.410 align:middle line:90%
there in Alaska.

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And they are getting
that information for me

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:38.690 align:middle line:84%
of either the old giant tales
or from their culture of some

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:42.560 align:middle line:84%
of these different supernatural
beings like the Kushtaka

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and some of these other
entities and beings

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:45.898 align:middle line:90%
that have been seen up there.

00:42:45.898 --> 00:42:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
interrelated to each other.

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But they came from
the old world.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.810 align:middle line:84%
They came from
the ancient world.

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Now that's fascinating
because you're right.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Our attention usually turns
to the Middle East or Egypt--

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.900 align:middle line:84%
ancient Egyptian
cultures as well.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't-- we don't think
of Alaska when we think back

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.845 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient ones
and the giants.

00:43:04.845 --> 00:43:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well, there's
even tie-ins to ancient Egypt

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.990 align:middle line:84%
because we talk
about the possibility

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Black Pyramid in
Alaska, which people believe

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.800 align:middle line:84%
is twice the size
of the Giza Pyramid

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and which could have also
been used as a power plant.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Dunn's theory
of the Giza Power plant.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: And I'm not so
certain on the whole part,

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:26.090 align:middle line:84%
but definitely some
sort of machine.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you go into the
queen's chamber, that niche--

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For purpose.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
definitely purpose.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:36.890 align:middle line:84%
There's vitrification in the
stone there, scored, charred

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.350 align:middle line:84%
from some sort of fire that's
back there on the stone.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like something
very, very hot was here.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.890 align:middle line:84%
It was not a place for an idol
that mainstream archaeology

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:47.180 align:middle line:90%
tries to tell us.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.560 align:middle line:90%
This was some sort of machinery.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So with all these
connections that you

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.330 align:middle line:84%
see of these different
pyramids across the world,

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.210 align:middle line:84%
if there really is a Black
Pyramid there in Alaska,

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:59.430 align:middle line:84%
did it have that same sort of
machine-like purpose to it?

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:05.060 align:middle line:84%
From my understanding, there
are pyramids literally littered

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.860 align:middle line:84%
around the world
that are still active

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.390 align:middle line:90%
that are under the surface.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking
hundreds of thousands of years

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.582 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids have been around
in cultures all over the world.

00:44:14.582 --> 00:44:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they're
covered by the sands of time.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.610 align:middle line:84%
But think about the notion--
they're still active.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you also
think about the notion

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.570 align:middle line:84%
of what you talked
about a while ago, which

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.670 align:middle line:84%
is they discovered these
positive and negative vortices,

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:27.470 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has been
determined scientifically.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And so where does
this all fit in?

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:36.200 align:middle line:84%
If we have these
pyramids under the ground

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and are unaware of
them until we start

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.940 align:middle line:84%
investing the money and
Earth penetrating radar

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and trying to find them all.

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:43.490 align:middle line:90%
These things are active.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're affecting what's
going on above the land.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:46.798 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Oh, absolutely.

00:44:46.798 --> 00:44:49.430 align:middle line:10%
There are stories about
pyramids in Antarctica.

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And you see these recent
studies coming out

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:53.510 align:middle line:84%
of Antarctica from
the ANITA project

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and the IceCube
project of neutrinos

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.690 align:middle line:84%
running in reverse out of
the ground without a source.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:03.350 align:middle line:10%
And so scientists-- actual
peer-reviewed scientific papers

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:09.530 align:middle line:10%
coming out now saying that this
is actually a parallel universe

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:11.035 align:middle line:10%
running in reverse time.

00:45:11.035 --> 00:45:12.410 align:middle line:84%
These are scientists
saying this.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.417 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This Is what
mentor Samantha Lawton

00:45:14.417 --> 00:45:15.500 align:middle line:90%
has been saying all along.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.570 align:middle line:84%
We have a mirrored
universe running

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.490 align:middle line:90%
in parallel reverse time.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And she's really quite
brilliant herself.

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
that's an area you're

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.840 align:middle line:84%
really digging into, but I
want to have a conversation

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.182 align:middle line:90%
with someone about that.

00:45:28.182 --> 00:45:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So we'll come back
and do that one.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Sounds great.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Mike, thank you so much.

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Thank you, Regina.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I really
appreciate the time.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.380 align:middle line:90%
This has been a lot of fun.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.338 align:middle line:90%
It's been enlightening.

00:45:35.338 --> 00:45:37.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of new thoughts
for us to ponder.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:38.300 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.693 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Thank you, Regina.

00:45:39.693 --> 00:45:41.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To see more
videos and pick up
