>>REGINA MEREDITH:
How many of us

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.010 align:middle line:10%
are dragging through
the days of our lives

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:10%
because we can't kick our
brains into gear, at least

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.820 align:middle line:10%
not without a cup of
joe or an energy drink?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:10%
And if it seems like it's
becoming more and more

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:10%
difficult to focus with
the distractions around us,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:10%
well, you are not alone.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Good news-- there
are new technologies

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.785 align:middle line:84%
on the horizon that promise
to shape our brains back

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:90%
up non-invasively.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:10%
And today we're talking about
an incredible technology

with Dr. Lana Morrow,
the inventor of Think!,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.385 align:middle line:10%
Welcome, Lana.

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:10%
>>LANA MORROW: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
so fun about this--

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: It's a pleasure.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --is since I
first found out about you

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and started researching
some of your works,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I had a chance to fly to New
York and then experience Think!

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine having
this conversation--

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:84%
not easily-- without having
actually experienced--

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --the technology.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we want to
know a little bit about you,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
like who's Dr. Morrow here.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So as a neuroscientist
and a neuropsychologist,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.230 align:middle line:84%
you started seeing
that there was

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:84%
a necessity for a new
kind of technology

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:90%
that you ultimately invented.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about your
background as a neuroscientist,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:90%
as a neuropsychologist.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:90%
What is neuropsychology even?

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:10%
>>MORROW: So I
started rather young.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:10%
And I was always attracted
to neuroscience, in general,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:10%
knowing more at a time
that neuroscience was not

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:10%
a popular field yet.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they didn't have
beautiful blonde women in it.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.092 align:middle line:90%

>>MORROW: You're so sweet.

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it was a male field.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And today as well, I
think in neurotechnology,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
we don't have too
many women leading,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:84%
being CEOs in neurotech
companies and inventors.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I think I might be the only
one for the moment doing

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:90%
what I've done.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:10%
So going back to
what my start was,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:10%
I've studied neuroscience
very early on in Rome

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.278 align:middle line:10%
and was interested in flow
of dopamine in general.

00:02:19.278 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The flow of dopamine.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Dopamine.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK now, before we go
any further, you have to stop

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and say look, tell us what
dopamine is responsible for

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:90%
and why this is such a big deal.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: So dopamine is
responsible for attentiveness,

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:84%
executive function,
memory, sleep.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most important
neurotransmitters in the brain.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And dopamine promotes
the communication

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:90%
between nerve cells.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
really important.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: So neuron to
neuron communication,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and the speed of communication
between those neurons that

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:84%
determines our
alertness, and planning,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and executive
functioning, memory--

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:90%
all what I said before.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.177 align:middle line:90%
That's largely response--

00:03:04.177 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.468 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're in a world
right now that is essentially

00:03:07.468 --> 00:03:09.970 align:middle line:84%
tanking our dopamine, or
jacking it up artificially.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
the net effect?

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Cause you've seen a
lot, a lot of clients.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
What are you finding the
effects of the way we're

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
living right now,
the distractions

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.888 align:middle line:84%
and having a lot of
consumption of energy drinks,

00:03:22.888 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and just
running, running, running.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
What is that doing to
our dopamine levels,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and how is that
affecting our lives?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: You see
the lack of dopamine

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:90%
in people who are stressed out.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.277 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: And
generally we can say

00:03:36.277 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
that the majority of American
population is stressed out.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:90%
We work around the clock.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And we don't take
enough time to take

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:84%
good care of our
relaxation, replenishing

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
our sleep, all of that which
replenishes and restores

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.610 align:middle line:90%
the dopamine.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So I would say
that in people who

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
have large amounts
of stress, dopamine

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:90%
goes into lower levels.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't help that we
have all these devices that

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
train us to think
in milliseconds

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:90%
and don't sustain--

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does not.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
a personality--

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
like, for example, let's
look at classic burnout.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle line:84%
We go to like some of
the films from the 2000s,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.899 align:middle line:84%
and even 1990s,
like "Wolf on Wall

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Street," these guys
that are up, they're

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:90%
very intensely dialed in.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Everything's at stake that day.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:84%
The bell goes off at whatever
time Wall Street bell goes off.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
What is that, 8:00 in the
morning, or something?

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:90%
And boom, you're on.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:84%
It's an adrenaline
rush the whole day.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.958 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this would
be a very extreme example

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:90%
of what happens.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Those are oftentimes
early burnouts, right?

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because you
have a situation

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
where the amygdala goes
into fight or flight mode

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we're programmed
to have available to us

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:84%
this surplus of adrenaline or
noradrenaline when we need it.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you put it on
override for a long time,

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
then you burn out
the entire system.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not in homeostasis anymore.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And these are people that are
in very extreme professions.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.812 align:middle line:84%
But what about just
your super-uber mom?

00:05:14.812 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Where you have to get
the kids to school,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.770 align:middle line:90%
then you got to go to the gym?

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of permeating
all of American life.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes, yes, right.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Children nowadays, as well,
are stressed out from the time

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
they're about five or six
because of the pressure

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.220 align:middle line:84%
that either the society
imposes on them from sports

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.637 align:middle line:90%
and the activities--

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In school.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Scholastic activities.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And then also they are exposed
to different iPads and iPhones.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So their reaction times and
their times of sustained

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.220 align:middle line:90%
attention are shortened.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
They're not naturally
reinforced to stay

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:90%
on task for a long time.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:84%
They're reinforced to stay
on task for milliseconds

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.315 align:middle line:84%
or seconds, which trains
their brain for short memory

00:06:02.315 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
or for shortened amount
of attention span.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're not primed
like we were before.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
When we were growing
up, I think we

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
were spending a lot of time in
nature, and climbing on trees,

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, playing with
a ball, playing hopscotch.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Those are all things that I
think our children have not

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:84%
had the chance to really
experience to the degree

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And dopamine
then must be very reliant

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
on these very natural cycles of
life and nature itself, then.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Indeed, yes.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so when we've
removed ourselves from nature,

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:90%
just that alone.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: And I think the sheer
amount of joy and pleasure

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:90%
decreases.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, Harvard
School talks about

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:84%
dopamine being the happiness
hormone, hormone of happiness,

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:90%
joy.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
important to keep that element

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.345 align:middle line:90%
in what we say, the high vibe.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:90%
You get reinforced.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:84%
If you have an Instagram
account and you get a like,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:84%
your dopamine level goes up
because it's a reinforcement.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Like a Pavlovian bell, you know,
when Pavlov trained the dogs.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
The dog would salivate when
he would see the steak.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And then if he would see
the reward associated

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.230 align:middle line:84%
with the belt, then the sound
of the bell made him salivate.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't salivate, but
we are yearning for our click

if you abstain from judgment,

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.145 align:middle line:84%
it can be viewed as
just another world.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.640 align:middle line:84%
You see certain things that

We're still not
luckily into that yet.

00:10:25.477 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But the brain gets rewired
in a very specific way

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.610 align:middle line:84%
for short bursts
of reinforcements

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.670 align:middle line:84%

thinks very differently

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:84%

these kind of children

who operate on daily
reinforcement or daily gaming,

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.440 align:middle line:84%
they have a very hard

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Because in order
to read a book, you

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:84%
have to have a moment that will
track the sentence on the page.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have
a sustained attention

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and peace within your heart as
well to stay still and enjoy

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:90%
the book.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.530 align:middle line:90%
while you're reading.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
You can even tangentially think
about something else, remember.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you're immersed
in the video gaming world,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
there is little margin
for exploration,

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:84%
in milliseconds
even, on your own.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Because you're fully engaged,
and you're demanded to perform.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So you're in this
fight or flight

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.520 align:middle line:90%

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing
that most of the time

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.460 align:middle line:84%
because you want
to get to the point

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
where you have a lot of points
and you score really well.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you're in that
state of tension.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:84%
I've studied some of the
studies that came out

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:84%
on children in
China who have been

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:90%
severely seriously addicted.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And these are generally
boys whose parents

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:84%
are desperate because they
play video games all the time,

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.590 align:middle line:90%
and they have addiction.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So they created now camps
for the boys to go to.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And these are children
who are like 12, 15.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
They have to go to these centers
for rehabilitation of the game

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:90%

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a hard one.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.137 align:middle line:90%
It's like any kind of rehab.

00:12:34.137 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: It's like
any kind of rehab.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
unwire the brain.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:90%
The brain wires itself.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So the good news on that is
that you can change the brain.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:90%
The brain is plastic.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.203 align:middle line:90%
It's malleable.

00:12:45.203 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
change the brain.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Not only can you
change it by routes,

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:84%
but you can change it also
by cortical thickness.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:84%
You can do a lot with
the brain to remodel it

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And that may mean having
to be in a washout period,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
without any screen time
for maybe a month or two.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
replace it with equally

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:84%
pleasurable and rewarding
new world, new activities.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And usually it's this
wonderful interaction

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:84%
with human or
animal interactions

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:90%
that are rewarding.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And once the brain
gets used to that,

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.280 align:middle line:84%
your mind enjoys it
much more, and it

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.652 align:middle line:90%

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
as a neuroscientist, and let's
talk about how you ended up

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:90%
going into this technology.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: So for a while
I was working at Mt.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Sinai doing research in

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:84%
After a while then, I
rerouted my own trajectory,

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.460 align:middle line:84%
my own career, into
neuropsychology.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
pencil and paper tasks

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and testing young
children and adults

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:84%
for ADHD problems, any

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And that led me
to see that there

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:84%
is a population within
especially young children who

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:90%
can't take stimulants.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Their parents don't want
them to be on medication,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:90%
but also they had heart issues.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.485 align:middle line:90%
If you have a heart issue--

00:14:37.485 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kids?

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.207 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: The kids who were
born with some heart issue.

00:14:40.207 --> 00:14:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.032 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: They can't
take stimulants.

00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:44.113 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:44.113 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:10%
>>MORROW: I had three
clients like that,

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:10%
and the parents
asked me explicitly

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:10%
if I could be helpful
at some levels

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:10%
to really create something that
could be helping them get out

00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:10%
of their ADHD mode and
increase their attention,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:10%
increase their short-term
memory, working memory.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:10%
And so I set up to
devise first some games--

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:10%
ocular motor tracking games
and some other video games.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ocular motor
tracking games, OK.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: Yes, just for the
psychotic movement tracking.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Very simple.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:90%
But they were still video games.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:90%
They were still on the screen.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very effective,
and you can measure it down

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:90%
to a millisecond.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.415 align:middle line:84%
See, that's the beauty
of these new devices--

00:15:25.415 --> 00:15:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:90%

00:15:28.078 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to work with everything
that is extremely technical.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:90%
So MRI, fMRI, DTI, EEG--

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:84%
everything is
electrophysiological

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:90%
and derived--

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:90%
computer-linked in a way.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.777 align:middle line:84%

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:24.170 align:middle line:84%
with clinical patients

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:29.030 align:middle line:84%
were the development of various
neuromodulating, neurofeedback

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:84%
technologies that
were out there.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was having fun with one
called Brain State Technologies

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:90%
probably now about 13 years ago.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was wonderful,
but it was kind of bulky.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had to spend
long periods of time in it.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
The technician had to
really have the ability

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.310 align:middle line:84%
to interpret and analyze
as you were going.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it was just--

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: It was
not plug and play.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
not plug and play.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how you got
to a more plug and play model.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
You created this
entirely new electrode,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.117 align:middle line:84%
which is really
key to what you do

00:17:07.117 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and the brilliance
of this technology.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:84%
So now going from working
with these clients

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:84%
into developing the
technology and the electrodes,

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.480 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about that.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: So there
was a need for that.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to save
time, the technician, who

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:28.355 align:middle line:84%
sits in front of a patient
and applies the head--

00:17:28.355 --> 00:17:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Electrodes.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.105 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Electrodes.

00:17:30.105 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:84%
They're usually called the
caps, the electrode caps.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Siegen is one of the
companies that makes them.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And I spent three
years doing it.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I really promised myself one day
I would make something simpler

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Because you know,
you spend an hour

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:middle line:84%
placing this on
a patient's head,

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and then it's not
even that reliable.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.390 align:middle line:84%
The gel dries out, and
the signal is not strong.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.015 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you're placing them

00:17:53.015 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
at all the different
areas of the brain, right?

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.247 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes, you do, yeah.

00:17:56.247 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I made an electrode
that has a specific alloy.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And I work with
Honeywell Robotics, which

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.120 align:middle line:84%
is a spacecraft
engineering company,

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:90%
and they're very precise.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And the trick, as with
everything that works,

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:84%
is to be precise, to be
exact, and to use technology

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that is available
that you can combine

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:20.080 align:middle line:84%
with some additional
information that you create,

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and creating exact devices,
precise, high-precision

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:90%
devices.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:90%
So our device has been created.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
These electrodes conduct much
faster and much more reliably.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Signal to noise ratio is much
better signal to noise ratio.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
only two electrodes

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:90%
that are placed right here.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: It's four, actually,
four electrodes in this case.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.920 align:middle line:90%
And what is Think!?

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Think! is the device
that contains these--

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.388 align:middle line:90%
It's a strip, a simple strip.

00:18:50.388 --> 00:18:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like a headband.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: You put
it on the head.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just put it
on like a headband.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: And it takes one
second to put it on the head.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And it picks up reliably
and with verified

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
signal the signal and the
brain waves from your head

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and logs it into the
computer in front of you.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:10%
So you sit with this headband
in front of the laptop.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.247 align:middle line:10%
And you play via thought
only, you play video games.

00:19:17.247 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Wirelessly
via thought only, yeah.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.728 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I just want to back
up for one moment

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.395 align:middle line:84%
because then we're going
to go right into the game.

00:19:25.395 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Besides the
technological expertise

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:84%
you had, there was a
lot of inspiration kind

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:84%

time in your life

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.390 align:middle line:84%

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have things

I think we all get inspired.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, Einstein

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:90%
would get inspired in a shower.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Or anybody who thinks any

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
you know, my teammates who
are incredibly smart, we all

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.440 align:middle line:90%
get inspired--

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:90%
you probably too for your book.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, you don't
know when it'll hit you.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But maybe when you're
picking flowers in a field.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:84%

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: But also
I meditated on it.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.235 align:middle line:90%
So I trained myself--

00:20:28.235 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:84%

our grandparents used to do.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.685 align:middle line:84%
They would always take a
little siesta after lunch.

00:20:47.685 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning, they
would read their newspaper

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
or sip a cup of coffee,
just do a little nothing

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:90%
And gather yourself.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:84%
You would be surprised
how much more at ease

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.827 align:middle line:90%
you become then recognizing--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then just rushing,
slamming into the day.

00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:23.585 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Exactly.

00:21:23.585 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't stop to think
or to listen to your higher

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.530 align:middle line:90%
self or to your gut feeling.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.788 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: And if
you train yourself

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:84%
to listen to your gut
feeling or your higher self,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.275 align:middle line:90%
then your ideas come in.

00:21:34.275 --> 00:21:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And so you had quite a
bit of that going on.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.052 align:middle line:84%
And I love-- lots
of inspiration,

00:21:39.052 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:90%
including your necklace here.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:40.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Before we came on, they
were looking at it, saying--

>>MORROW: This is
an artist from Rome.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --what is--
what's that necklace?

00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: An art piece.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an art piece,
but those are dendrites.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.918 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: Those
are dendrites, yes.

00:21:48.918 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:84%
This is our kind of quirky
way of making a statement when

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.440 align:middle line:90%
you're a scientist.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: This is
my little trademark.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that was just
one of your creative insights

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.357 align:middle line:84%
that were pouring
in at this time.

00:22:00.357 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So now you've created
these electrodes.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
You've created
this wireless game

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
where your thoughts are working
with your own technologies,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and you have a few
different programs.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:84%
But the reason we talk
so much about dopamine

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:84%
is because boosting
dopamine naturally--

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
is that the most prominent
program that you use of them?

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes, yes.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.765 align:middle line:84%
Because it really
regulates the vagus nerve,

00:22:23.765 --> 00:22:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and it regulates the dopamine
and seratonin, and balances

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.600 align:middle line:84%
dopamine and seratonin
in the brain.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
people who have ADHD--

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and we have studied it,
we have double blind study

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:90%
we have just completed.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.675 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The study you
did out of Barcelona?

00:22:37.675 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Out of Barcelona.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:84%
But it was designed
between the scientists

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:84%
at Columbia Presbyterian,
Columbia University, NYU, Mt.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Sinai, all of them
based in New York.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the reason we
ended up in Barcelona

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:90%
is because of the cost.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
millions to conduct it here.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: It was much
less costly to create

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.712 align:middle line:84%
a study in Barcelona
than in New York City.

00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
the study and what you found.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Because it's pretty stunning.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yeah, it's wonderful.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the team of many,
many neuroscientists.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Altogether on this
project of 11 years,

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.470 align:middle line:84%
we have been more than
450 of us working on it.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And de facto scientists that
are on the headline of the paper

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that we're about to
publish now were 13 of us.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
leaders of their teams.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And all of them have
one connection, which

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.568 align:middle line:90%
is we all understand dopamine--

00:23:35.568 --> 00:23:36.860 align:middle line:90%
dopamine and neurotransmission.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now this study
was based on Think! technology

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:90%
and ADHD kids.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: ADHD children.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, some are young
adults because some are 18,

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and in Europe, 18 you
qualify as an adult.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: But 6 to
18, 62 children.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:24:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Then we ended up with just a
cohort of about 42, 21 and 21

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.990 align:middle line:84%
children in placebo
and experimental group.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.930 align:middle line:90%
And we ran them through--

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:90%
it's a double blind.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So it was very rigorously
created, designed

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:90%
and performed.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And in Barcelona, we
finally performed the study

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.870 align:middle line:90%
in a very rigorous environment.

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And these children
underwent numerous tests--

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:84%
psychological, psychiatric,
neuropsychological, an EEG test

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:34.310 align:middle line:84%
continually before, during, and
after electroencephalographic

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:90%
recordings in real time.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:90%
And fMRIs and MRIs--

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
was a legit test--

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Very legitimate, yes.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.707 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From
every angle looking

00:24:43.707 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:84%
at the brain and
the improvement.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: --with top
level institutions.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
were the results?

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MORROW: So the results which
we were hoping for, where

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:10%
that there is neuroplasticity.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:84%
That if you train noninvasively,
nothing goes in your head.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:84%
You're managing the brain with
your own thought, via thought

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:90%
only.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.670 align:middle line:10%
You end up with
this trajectory that

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:10%
is carved in the brain
that is different from what

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:10%
we've started with.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So this placebo
group participants

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:90%
had none of those new signs.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:10%
But the experimental
group participants

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.270 align:middle line:10%
showed new activation
of new pathways.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And so this was very
significant for us

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:90%
because it's a new technology.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:10%
And it took only six weeks
for this to produce itself.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:10%
And the children
elevated their mood.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:84%
They were much less
aggressive, much calmer.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:10%
They were focused.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Their working memory increased--

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:84%
even long-term memory
on some memory tests.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Their scholastic
performance increased.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
performing overall much better.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
What we found out that
was not expected--

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.580 align:middle line:90%
we were really shocked.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:10%
We had to repeat the test
with different laboratories

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:10%
many times.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:10%
We found out that the
cortical thickness

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.730 align:middle line:10%
with this noninvasive
Think! training

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:16.720 align:middle line:10%
increased in the frontal
areas of the brain

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:10%
and dorsal lateral
areas of brain that

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:10%
are used when we are
engaging in focused activity,

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:10%
in memory, and in planning.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.027 align:middle line:84%
They increased in thickness
by significant amount.

00:26:29.027 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That means
you're regrowing.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: You're
creating new cells.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
creating new brain cells.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: You create new mass.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:90%
So we have to--

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.555 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Regrowing the brain.

00:26:37.555 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: Growing your
mass, yes, via thought.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So we just have to, in order
to really totally prove

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:84%
all of that, the
second part, we have

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
the fact that there is a
cortical thickness that

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.100 align:middle line:90%
has increased.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: That's the fact.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:90%
There is measurable--

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Producing
new brain cells.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So now in order to claim that
this is really a new brain

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.870 align:middle line:84%
cell, we're running
a new study now

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that is tied into genetics
and with CAT scans,

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:84%
so that we can actually de
facto say these are true cells.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.960 align:middle line:84%
We think they are because
they're in those area that

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:90%
are operating in cortex.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.510 align:middle line:90%
So cortex is rich in neurons.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And a specific area, this
cortical area for dopamine

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.950 align:middle line:84%
function, we think--
we believe these

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
are dopamine-producing cells.

now in this distracted world,

this rushed stressed out

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.170 align:middle line:84%
that we begin producing
our own dopamine again.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And then starting behaviorally
to modify our lives so that we

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.710 align:middle line:84%
can continue doing that
even after exposure

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:90%
to such a lovely technology.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.940 align:middle line:90%
So now you're finding--

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.510 align:middle line:84%
you've had many, many
clients through the years.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're finding
that Think seems

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:59.050 align:middle line:84%
to work in almost inexplicable
ways on a wide variety

00:27:59.050 --> 00:27:59.920 align:middle line:90%
of conditions.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.930 align:middle line:90%
And one of them is autism.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And you then shared
with me a video

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.470 align:middle line:84%
of a young man who
came in, you took

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of film of
him when he first arrived.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Your heart goes out
to the guy, you know.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:90%
He's about 15 years old, right?

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you took one after.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was shocking,
to me, it was

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
shocking to see the
difference in his personality

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and behavior.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So he played the
dopamine boosting game.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and
so standard-- they

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.123 align:middle line:84%
have to do sessions
which are really short.

00:28:34.123 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:90%

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: So we
recommend 20 times

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:84%
because we see the results
that are almost permanent.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And you experienced
these yourself

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:90%
so you can testify to that but.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:84%
We have the medical data that
showed that after 20 minutes,

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.120 align:middle line:84%
the pathway is consolidated and
cortical thickness increases.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:90%

So he already had four
meetings with me before.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And in that meeting, you
saw before the training

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:90%
and after the training.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know what?

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go ahead
and roll that film.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.022 align:middle line:84%
I want everybody to see this
dramatic change in the boy.

like many autistic children do.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you
transition, you can get

really upset and expressing--
because of lack of language.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.330 align:middle line:84%

>>MORROW: And it's composed of
levodopa and carbidopa, which

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.910 align:middle line:84%

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
fascinated me about it

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:35.980 align:middle line:84%
was that you could see
not just your mind,

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:40.020 align:middle line:90%
but your emotions in real time.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Just a subtle shift in emotions,
a subtle shift in thought.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So the game I was playing
requires you-- it's so cute.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:90%
It's just cute.

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: The Gates.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have a little
skier going through the gates,

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.430 align:middle line:84%
right, bringing the gates
together with their mind.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And so having been a skier
for my whole life, actually.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: Yes,
you're a pro skier.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was
really easy for me,

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.658 align:middle line:90%
you know, to think in that way.

00:40:59.658 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But as I start going through it
first, you know, I'm looking,

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I want results.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
a little anxious.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:06.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what's
going to happen.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring
the gates together,

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.575 align:middle line:84%
you get that neural
feedback reinforcement,

00:41:11.575 --> 00:41:13.235 align:middle line:90%
with that little sound.

00:41:13.235 --> 00:41:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Little sound.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Little sound.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And a gentle sound.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A gentle,
little sound.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And these little
gates come together.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And when they really
line up, there's

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.490 align:middle line:84%
a circle between
them that's formed.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of
just sail through.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: In the
zone, in the flow.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the zone.

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And I found that in the
beginning when I was playing

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:31.390 align:middle line:90%
it, I was trying too hard.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:33.748 align:middle line:84%
And I was having a harder
time getting things

00:41:33.748 --> 00:41:36.290 align:middle line:84%
where I wanted to-- come on,
why aren't they coming together?

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.082 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, there was a point

00:41:38.082 --> 00:41:40.360 align:middle line:84%
fairly early on for
me, which is lucky,

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that I went into the
moment and I thought,

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I just want to have fun.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.010 align:middle line:90%
And I went into this day--

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: With ease and grace.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With ease and grace.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying that to
myself, ease and grace.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And I imagined that I was almost
like on a toboggan or something

00:41:55.810 --> 00:42:01.030 align:middle line:84%
where I was leaning back, and I
was just going and saying yes.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And I just found myself
reaching out wanting to tap

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:05.320 align:middle line:90%
the gates as I went through.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: Fun, fun, fun.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And this joy started
rising Inside me.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that, it was
hard for it not to work.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Everything started lining up.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.920 align:middle line:90%
The gates came together.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, wow,
this is so cool.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:25.030 align:middle line:84%
But I was in a state of
coherent joy in myself.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And I watched the
coherence in my brain.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.435 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd stop
and think, oh my god,

00:42:29.435 --> 00:42:30.560 align:middle line:90%
how come this is happening.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.335 align:middle line:90%
Boom, the gates go apart again.

out of the moment.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.440 align:middle line:84%

the gates were apart again.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.320 align:middle line:90%
It's like, hold on a minute.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Cut me a little slack here.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:42.300 align:middle line:90%
You know, I just got in.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.900 align:middle line:90%
I worked hard, and I go back.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And I found in the subsequent
sessions, over and over--

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:48.850 align:middle line:90%
it's an interesting flow.

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I was only
there a short time.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:53.485 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing two a
days, even three a day.

00:42:53.485 --> 00:42:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.878 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At that time.

00:42:54.878 --> 00:42:56.230 align:middle line:90%
So my brain would get fatigued.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But I could stay kind of in

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes.

>>REGINA: It
definitely does nicely.

And so when it was all
over I felt this sense of,

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.920 align:middle line:84%
on one level, my brain's
worked really hard.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But one thing-- one of my
bugaboos in life is patience.

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And I hate being late, I
hate being late for anything.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.670 align:middle line:90%
And I had to go to the airport.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
traffic jam on one

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.750 align:middle line:84%
of your main boulevards
leading to LaGuardia.

Normally that kind of thing,
I'm kind of, you know,

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:29.590 align:middle line:90%
my blood's rising.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.572 align:middle line:90%

this traffic jam--

to the driver, how long is
it going to last, right?

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.752 align:middle line:84%
And I found it was like, I'm
going to be there in time,

00:43:38.752 --> 00:43:39.552 align:middle line:90%
no problem.

00:43:39.552 --> 00:43:40.930 align:middle line:90%

So I thought, yes,
joy is coherence.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.550 align:middle line:84%
You know when everyone
says, oh, you know,

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:56.398 align:middle line:84%
just find your bliss
and everything.

00:43:56.398 --> 00:43:58.690 align:middle line:84%
It took a different meaning,
because I'm scientifically

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.325 align:middle line:90%
watching it in real time.

00:44:00.325 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: Because the

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.080 align:middle line:10%
So it's like running
high definition Netflix

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:11.980 align:middle line:10%
movie from your head.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:12.790 align:middle line:90%

And it logs it at a speed of
2,048 cycles per second, which

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:22.090 align:middle line:84%
is super fast, which means
that it reacts to your changes

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:24.430 align:middle line:90%
in the brain and mine very fast.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And emotion.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.517 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: And emotion.

00:44:26.517 --> 00:44:27.910 align:middle line:90%
But your emotion is--

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.970 align:middle line:84%
so if you have a
lot of dopamine,

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:33.010 align:middle line:84%
let's say when you're in
love or you hug your child,

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:90%
you have a lot of dopamine.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.110 align:middle line:90%
You're happy.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:36.430 align:middle line:90%
You elicit that emotion.

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:39.880 align:middle line:84%
That elicits different
electrical frequency,

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and your brainwaves are
different from that expression

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:45.670 align:middle line:90%
of emotion.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Neurochemically and
electrophysiologically,

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:51.780 align:middle line:90%
it is linked to EEG--

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.690 align:middle line:90%
what to emit.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:57.190 align:middle line:84%

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.270 align:middle line:90%
I did it one more time.

I couldn't screw
up if I wanted to

You have to close them off.

really intensely.

be yawning and be tired,

or fall asleep for half
an hour after the session.

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Because it reflects
their lack of dopamine.

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And then when you pump
them with dopamine,

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:36.260 align:middle line:84%
or when their brain starts
making dopamine very quickly,

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.390 align:middle line:90%
they immediately feel it.

little bit tired.

But for example, in evening,
after two hours, three hours,

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:47.390 align:middle line:84%
they'll feel happier,
more productive.

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:48.560 align:middle line:90%
Their sleep will be better.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.143 align:middle line:84%

they'll be much more

that program in and of itself.

00:49:32.138 --> 00:49:33.680 align:middle line:84%

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:54.338 align:middle line:90%
of that, justifiably so.

00:51:54.338 --> 00:51:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And she would mutter
under her breath

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and not really communicate
much with people around her.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Because she was intimidated.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.930 align:middle line:90%
She was really afraid.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:04.020 align:middle line:90%
So she was living--

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.680 align:middle line:90%
you see that with everybody.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.610 align:middle line:84%
We're programmed
like that that if we

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:09.530 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of
negative experience,

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:13.380 align:middle line:84%
many negative experience in
life, we will live in fear.

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.600 align:middle line:90%
We curl up.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:18.080 align:middle line:84%
We cry or we're upset
about something.

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.475 align:middle line:84%
Even animals who are
afraid, they'll curl up.

And what happened
with her, she turned

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:28.730 align:middle line:90%
into-- her fears stopped.

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So she turned into a happy
child, happy teenager

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:34.080 align:middle line:90%
that was fearless.

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.010 align:middle line:84%
She went to perform
in front of her--

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:38.720 align:middle line:90%
she didn't miss a day at school.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And anytime she
needed to perform

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.990 align:middle line:84%
in front of the classroom, she
was the first one to volunteer.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do we
have video on her?

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: We have a
video of this girl.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's take a
look at that one.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:50.510 align:middle line:10%
- My grades went from one
and twos to fours and fives,

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:52.070 align:middle line:10%
like threes, fours, and fives.

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:55.190 align:middle line:10%
And I'm actually a kid who wants
to go to school now instead

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:57.350 align:middle line:10%
of staying home and
doing nothing all day,

00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:00.500 align:middle line:10%
and just not doing any work and
getting myself into trouble.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.570 align:middle line:10%
- How's the report card today?

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:04.970 align:middle line:10%
- Fours and fives,
and it's very--

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:06.340 align:middle line:10%
- Straightforward excellence.

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.140 align:middle line:10%
- Yeah.

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:09.020 align:middle line:10%
- How many days of
school have you missed?

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:09.830 align:middle line:10%
- Zero.

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:11.750 align:middle line:10%
- Zero, amazing.

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:12.740 align:middle line:10%
It is great.

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:13.730 align:middle line:10%
And you feel?

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:14.730 align:middle line:10%
- I feel amazing.

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:15.770 align:middle line:10%
I feel great.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:18.653 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, you know,
this is profound stuff.

00:53:18.653 --> 00:53:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen a
few others of them.

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:22.952 align:middle line:84%
And of course, some people
may not be as marked,

00:53:22.952 --> 00:53:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and those aren't the ones
you're probably going

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:26.830 align:middle line:90%
to take the videos of per se.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:32.200 align:middle line:84%
The ones who have really overt
progress are what we're seeing,

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:36.818 align:middle line:84%
However, it's so overt that
that's why I was so excited.

00:53:36.818 --> 00:53:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I've always been excited
about brain technologies

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.780 align:middle line:90%
though for many, many years.

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But why I was so
excited about this.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.950 align:middle line:90%
And I saw a few others as well.

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: Yeah, people
stop with their migraines,

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:47.450 align:middle line:90%

>>MORROW: ADHD, suicidal.

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:51.490 align:middle line:90%
ADHD goes away.

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.110 align:middle line:90%
But it's all the same mechanism.

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:55.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the mechanism of
the dopamine energy.

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And we think it's mesence--

00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:01.180 align:middle line:84%
We know we have the data that
it is mesencephalic central part

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.880 align:middle line:90%
of the brain of the dopamine.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:07.240 align:middle line:90%
It's very easily identifiable.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This appears
to be operating.

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:12.610 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
the technology keeps

00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:15.410 align:middle line:84%
changing as you change when
you're playing the game.

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.250 align:middle line:90%

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:26.417 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: It's like your
private trainer that trains

And if you happen
to be an Olympian,

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:32.440 align:middle line:84%
your trainer will
really come down on you.

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And it does, it works
you harder and harder.

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But we were talking
about this afterward

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and saying, it seems like
there's something going on,

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:48.430 align:middle line:84%
almost a potential for it
tapping in more to a unity

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:49.270 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.690 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: Consciousness
is your thing.

>>MORROW: Dopamine, yeah.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk
to us about that.

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.392 align:middle line:84%
What is the potential
with games like these?

00:54:59.392 --> 00:55:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: Well, I
think that if you

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:05.350 align:middle line:84%
have a coherence between the
heart and the mind, in general,

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and you reached
certain frequencies

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:11.560 align:middle line:84%
which are frequencies that are
associated with joy and bliss.

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't have to be
monks in Bhutan or Tibet

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:20.710 align:middle line:84%
sitting for hours forever
to reach that kind of bliss.

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:25.610 align:middle line:84%
We daily reach it anyway
if you hug your loved one,

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:26.590 align:middle line:90%
you hug your pet.

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:28.150 align:middle line:90%
That's your bliss.

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.460 align:middle line:84%
It lasts maybe a second
or two, but that's

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.850 align:middle line:90%
your moment of bliss.

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So the question is of
sustaining this moment of bliss

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.600 align:middle line:90%
in constant trajectory.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you expand
that moment of bliss

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.270 align:middle line:84%
to make it a day
of place, you know,

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:45.560 align:middle line:84%
it's a Yes day for
the whole time.

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: And we
all experience that.

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.767 align:middle line:84%
We have days that
are really fantastic,

00:55:50.767 --> 00:55:52.600 align:middle line:84%
something really great
happened in our life.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.940 align:middle line:90%
We graduate.

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:57.580 align:middle line:84%
We're in a happy mood for about
two, three days, four days.

00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you sustain that with
conscious awareness, just

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:06.940 align:middle line:84%
the mere fact that you're
lighting up your mood

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and you're raising your
awareness, it's the awareness.

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.660 align:middle line:84%
You're raising your
consciousness as well

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.110 align:middle line:90%
in parallel.

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you had raised your
consciousness at that level,

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.760 align:middle line:84%
you must be tapping to something
that is what in physics they

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.590 align:middle line:90%
call the field--

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Carl Sagan and physicists call
it the electrophysiological--

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:29.827 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you're really--

00:56:29.827 --> 00:56:32.035 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: Quantum field as

00:56:32.035 --> 00:56:33.730 align:middle line:84%

>>MORROW: Tap into the field.

00:56:34.015 --> 00:56:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to become non-local

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.055 align:middle line:84%
is more coherent,
is greater capacity.

00:56:39.055 --> 00:56:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: More
coherency brings us

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:42.670 align:middle line:90%
higher capacity of awareness.

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And then connects us in a more
aware fashion to this unity

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.950 align:middle line:84%
field, which in physics, you
know, they call it the unity

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:54.310 align:middle line:90%
field of quantum physics.

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And in meditation, we call it
field of unity consciousness.

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think the two
terms are different,

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.330 align:middle line:84%
but they're the
same field, which

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:06.400 align:middle line:84%
is this field that
is not measured

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.260 align:middle line:90%
in electrochemical potential.

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's measured
in quantum waves.

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So quantum physicists have
known about this existence

00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:16.500 align:middle line:84%
of this field for now
probably 80 years.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, what has been researched--
and Harvard research

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and Stanford Research has shown
that in Cambridge University

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.980 align:middle line:84%
in England have data,
the physicists have

00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:29.320 align:middle line:84%
data that this
field is conscious

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.340 align:middle line:84%
that the cosmos, the
universe is conscious.

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're not trained
to think in those terms.

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:38.770 align:middle line:84%
But physicists,
the mathematicians

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:44.010 align:middle line:84%
of those high levels where they
actually really talk about it,

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:45.910 align:middle line:90%
they have data.

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:48.490 align:middle line:84%
They have physics
and mathematical data

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and recordings on
the field responding

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.110 align:middle line:90%
in conscious aware level.

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So if we tap into that
higher consciousness,

00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.022 align:middle line:84%
we can call it our higher
self, our higher consciousness,

00:58:00.022 --> 00:58:01.480 align:middle line:84%
higher level of
awareness, whatever

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.490 align:middle line:84%
you call it is
irrelevant, the beauty

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:05.380 align:middle line:84%
of the mere fact
that you can actually

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:09.640 align:middle line:84%
expand your potential, that you
can actually expand your mind

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:10.510 align:middle line:90%
is priceless.

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:11.593 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is priceless.

00:58:11.593 --> 00:58:13.692 align:middle line:84%
And we have almost no
time left, and I'm going

00:58:13.692 --> 00:58:15.860 align:middle line:90%
to ask you two quick questions.

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:17.532 align:middle line:84%
Do people often
reflect back then

00:58:17.532 --> 00:58:18.990 align:middle line:84%
that their own
intuitive capacities

00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:21.300 align:middle line:84%
or creative capacities
start opening up.

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Yes,

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.602 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that makes sense.

00:58:23.602 --> 00:58:25.394 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: Better work,
they perform better.

00:58:25.394 --> 00:58:26.194 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:26.194 --> 00:58:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And they sustain
their performance

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:28.680 align:middle line:90%
at the higher levels.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:29.580 align:middle line:90%
And they become more aware.

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:32.577 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: And they say, wow, I'm
a different person from before.

00:58:32.577 --> 00:58:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now this
is a weird question.

00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:37.990 align:middle line:84%
This game is already
adapting to your brain.

00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:39.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a smart game.

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And as our brains start
increasing in consciousness,

00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:47.280 align:middle line:84%
tapping more into the
field, is that going

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.480 align:middle line:90%
to affect the game itself?

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: Well, the game
rises in performance

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.680 align:middle line:84%
as you rise in performance,
like a smart trainer.

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So obviously it has to
rise to the next level.

00:58:57.870 --> 00:58:59.328 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
almost like, is this

00:58:59.328 --> 00:59:03.060 align:middle line:84%
going to start taking on its
own new energetic information

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and such as people continue
to grow using the game, right,

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:08.460 align:middle line:90%
and expand the capacity.

00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm just asking.

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: I think that it's
really directly proportionally

00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:15.252 align:middle line:90%
related to what you emit.

00:59:15.252 --> 00:59:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What you
personally emit.

00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:18.293 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: As long
as you want to train

00:59:18.293 --> 00:59:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and the game will
adapt to itself.

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:24.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not this entity
in and of itself.

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:30.160 align:middle line:10%
It's really a smart program that
enables you to train yourself

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.590 align:middle line:10%
for the better levels.

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:34.702 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All I can say,
Lana, we're out of time.

00:59:34.702 --> 00:59:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Thank you because I had
a wonderful experience.

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:37.493 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Thank you.

00:59:37.493 --> 00:59:39.549 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I do
want to do it again.

00:59:39.549 --> 00:59:40.632 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Welcome anytime.

00:59:40.632 --> 00:59:42.010 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for having me.

00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
you're so welcome.

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MORROW: It's
always a pleasure.

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thank you
for dedicating your life

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:49.090 align:middle line:84%
to understanding this and making
this available for everybody.

00:59:49.090 --> 00:59:52.750 align:middle line:10%
Because in the end, you want
to make this widely available

00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:54.000 align:middle line:10%
for a lot of people.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.520 align:middle line:10%
>>MORROW: And to heal PTSD
and ADHD across the world.

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:58.660 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that.

00:59:58.660 --> 00:59:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MORROW: Thank you.

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely fascinating
experience in technology,

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.760 align:middle line:90%
love it.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.135 align:middle line:10%
