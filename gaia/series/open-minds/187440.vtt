>>REGINA MEREDITH: This
season on "Open Minds,"

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I've teamed up with Freddy
Silva, author and world

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.540 align:middle line:84%
renowned expert on sacred
sites, Paola Harris,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:84%
investigative
journalist and author

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:84%
in the field of extraterrestrial
related phenomena,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.390 align:middle line:84%
local Sardinia
guide Rosella Loddo,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and Luigi Muscas, a
leading researcher

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:84%
on giant bones in Sardinia
who has discovered evidence

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
pointing to the connection
between the island of Sardinia

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient
culture of Atlantis.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Their elaborate stone sites,
roughly 7,000 of them,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.010 align:middle line:84%
are sprinkled all over the
island revealing tombs, bones,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and highly sophisticated
architecture.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
It's speculated that
people from Atlantis,

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:84%
including a giant
race of people,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:84%
immigrated to Sardinia
with their great knowledge,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.920 align:middle line:84%
leaving their tombs and
temples, called nuraghi behind.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:10%
With help from a team
of remote viewers led

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:10%
by Angela Thompson,
local Sardinia

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:10%
legends, and the writings
of Edgar Cayce and Ruth

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:10%
Montgomery, we uncover a deeper
understanding of these giants,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:10%
their nuraghi, and the
mystery surrounding

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:10%
their incredible
history on this island.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY SILVA: We're
taking little bread crumbs

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and trying to make a wonderful
loaf of bread out of it.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The message
that there may

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
have been highly
sophisticated cultures

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:84%
before our current time
begs many questions

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:90%
that we've been grappling with.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Why did they disappear?

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And how many more are there
buried under the sands of time?

00:01:43.490 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:90%
This is spectacular.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.730 align:middle line:10%
In our last episode, we
were with Freddy Silva

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:10%
out in the field.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking at the
nuraghi, these ancient stone

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
monuments, many of them
kind of beehive or conical

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.370 align:middle line:90%
shaped, very masculine.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:90%
It looks like what?

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.847 align:middle line:90%
15 feet high?

00:02:20.847 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: A little bit more, 20.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That were built
for specific ritual purposes

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
for what were considered
the tall people

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:90%
or giants or shining ones.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So we thought we were
going to be doing

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:90%
more of that the following day.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
But we had a surprise in store.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Right, Paola?

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: Yeah.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In this
particular case,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.702 align:middle line:84%
we'd had all our permits
basically denied.

00:02:41.702 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:84%
We thought we were going to be
able to go into more nuraghi

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.187 align:middle line:90%
sites and shoot.

00:02:45.187 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:90%
And they said, nope.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:90%
And they wouldn't let us shoot.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So that left a little
bit of open space.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And your friend Rosella,
wonderful woman,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:84%
said, there is
this special place

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that was very ancient
just for women.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:90%
So we thought, wait a minute.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.820 align:middle line:90%
We've got the time.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's go see what she's
talking about, right?

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:10%
It's a place of initiation.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.480 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: I'd never seen it.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:10%
So it was a treat for me too.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can't
see it from the road.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.543 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is a hidden site.

00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Other people don't
really go to this site.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not well-known at all.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
They know the big nuraghi
that are sticking up

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:84%
on the top of hills and out in
the valleys but not this place.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:10%
So first of all, this
was a site of initiation

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.965 align:middle line:10%
specifically for women.

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: In a
lot of traditions,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:84%
women are very, very
important in initiation rites.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.620 align:middle line:90%
And these were initiatory.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:84%
The nuraghi and such
were initiatory places.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, there are
spirits that kind of penetrate

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
these places where
rituals were done.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And so looking at it from a
meditative point of view, what

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:84%
was so fascinating to me is
this was a very specific kind

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.760 align:middle line:90%
of experience.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And we were all just
thrilled to have had the time

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:90%
to come into this discovery.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSELLA LODDO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: My
name is Rosella Loddo.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:90%
I live in Cagliari, Sardinia.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm very passionate about
archeological sites.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:10%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.440 align:middle line:10%
>>INTERPRETER: I visited
many sites in Sardinia.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:84%
But I'm most passionate about
Villa Sant'Antonio Domus De

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.495 align:middle line:84%
Janas, which means
home of the fairies.

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It is a very important and
powerful site, especially

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.380 align:middle line:90%
for women.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you
first found these caves

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and started going there,
how did this happen?

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of
experiences subsequently

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
have you had in these
caves here for the women?

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.103 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:44.103 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: I
attended a course

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.325 align:middle line:84%
on the frequency of
archeological sites.

00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And during this course, we
visited many of these sites

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
like the Villa Sant'Antonio
Domus De Janas.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a very strong
experience where

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:84%
we could feel the frequency that
would resonate from the site.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And since Villa Sant'Antonio
Domus De Janas resonated

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.630 align:middle line:84%
a frequency for the
woman's body, for us women,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:90%
it was a very strong experience.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you been going
to these caves for a long time?

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: In the beginning,
I visited the site once a week.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And on Sundays, I
would go with a friend

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
to feel the frequency
of the site.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And for many years, I would go
with one, sometimes a couple

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
of friends who were as
passionate about archeology

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:84%
as myself to visit and
experience the site.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: The first chamber
is the one of the young woman

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.750 align:middle line:84%
because we are talking about
a site of feminine initiation

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:84%
where the young
woman would initiate

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:90%
her life as an adult woman.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.825 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:05:53.825 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER:
The second chamber

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
is where the young woman
would feel for the first time

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.020 align:middle line:84%
the desire towards
finding a companion.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: The third
chamber is actually very sweet

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:84%
because the young woman
feels the sensation

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
of falling in love with
the accelerated heartbeat

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:90%
and sweetness.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER:
The fourth is when

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:84%
the young woman will
experience the first symptoms

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.130 align:middle line:90%
of menstruation.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.455 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: And
in the fifth chamber

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
is when the young woman
will very suddenly see

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.350 align:middle line:84%
a big change in
her body, a belly,

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.615 align:middle line:84%
and she will feel the
symptoms of being pregnant.

00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then this is the
site, the first chamber

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:84%
of step number
one, which was you

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
explained to us earlier that
this is where it all begins.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:90%
This is the first chamber.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.148 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Exactly.

00:07:00.148 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:90%
This is the first chamber.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the girl is
taken into this chamber.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And inside, as
we'll see, there's

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.770 align:middle line:84%
a bed, a stone slab for
the girl to lie down on.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the priest goes
over her energetically

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:84%
to see if she's healthy,
a healthy young female.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:84%
The priest would check that
she was in good health.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once they get
the blessing of the priest

00:07:24.013 --> 00:07:26.885 align:middle line:84%
that the girl is healthy, then
she continues her journey.

00:07:26.885 --> 00:07:28.093 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:28.093 --> 00:07:28.893 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:07:28.893 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
After that, she would continue
to the other chambers.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go in here.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
lie down for fun.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.207 align:middle line:90%
See what it's like in there.

00:07:36.207 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the girl
would lie down, right?

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:90%
And then?

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: Here, the priest
would feel the young woman's

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.585 align:middle line:90%
energy with their hands.

00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
priest goes and senses

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:90%
the energy coming from her body.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.432 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: To
check if everything

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:57.240 align:middle line:90%
was OK in good health.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she first has
to claim to be in good health

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.680 align:middle line:90%
reproductively.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Good health so she
can have babies.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we go to the next chamber,
the next step in the process.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.340 align:middle line:84%
This next one has a very
different frequency.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's the frequency of
girls awakening sexually?

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:84%
This one is the chamber
of the sexual excitement.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So to allow the girl to feel the
energy of her young sexuality

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.140 align:middle line:90%
beginning to build.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.752 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes, to
experience that excitement.

00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again, we see
that little well in the center.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.502 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: It's called
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] meaning

00:08:48.502 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:90%
a little hole, activation.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Activation
well in the middle

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
that would have water
in it for the ceremony.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.605 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:55.605 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
go inside and see

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:90%
what this energy feels like.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Some people really feel
the activation in them.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes to
experience the sensation.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
the big sensation.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we're in here now.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And I see there's
room for many girls.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So several girls are
in at the same time.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And you told me the
very last chamber

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.242 align:middle line:90%
is shaped like the uterus.

00:09:21.242 --> 00:09:23.870 align:middle line:10%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: Each wall
represents the uterus wall

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
uterus and then this

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.538 align:middle line:84%
is the activation
portion of the chamber.

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:34.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the little well that's
at the center of each of them,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:90%
normally filled with water.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And here, the water ripples out.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.182 align:middle line:84%
So there is a larger
concentric circle of water.

00:09:40.182 --> 00:09:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: In this hole,
the water spreads the frequency.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:90%
And that boosts the frequency?

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: And
activates the sensation.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
absolutely magnificent.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy that you told us.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know about this
before we came to Sardinia.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
You said, I have a
special place for you.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.340 align:middle line:10%
And this is one of my maybe top
places that we've built so far.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.235 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:10:06.235 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER:
For us women, this

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:84%
is a very, very beautiful
place, very powerful.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes very, very
powerful for the women.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Plus, all of the
surroundings with the flowers

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and the grasses and the water
surrounding us is so graceful,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:90%
so feminine.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It's very refreshing.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Falling in love.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:37.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So, Rosella, from
everything you've

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
told us so far,
in the first cave,

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
the girl went through
the priest's approval

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to make sure her health was
good and she was strong.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
The next one was to
go into this chamber

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.450 align:middle line:84%
where she started
first being initiated

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:90%
into the sexual energy within.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And now we come to the chamber
of the heart and falling

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:90%
in love.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
This is the chamber where
by herself, she would

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:90%
feel her heartbeat accelerate.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in here are
two different chambers

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.932 align:middle line:84%
for the right and the
left halves of the heart.

00:11:14.932 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.348 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: It represents
the left and right sides

00:11:18.348 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:84%
The auricle and
ventricle of the heart.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And so here was bringing in that
very refined frequency of love

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:84%
to activate the
heart, so she could

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
have a real connection with
her partner on the love level.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:84%
The frequency of love,
of falling in love.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very high
frequency for the love.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
That last cave had incredibly
powerful frequencies in it,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.160 align:middle line:84%
just you could feel it
rising up in the body.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:84%
But this one is
much more refined.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes, very sweet.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, more sweet.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Sweet.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
one we're going to,

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
we'll just take a quick peek at,
it's just a very small opening.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's for the girl's
first menstruation.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So she's moving into physical
ability to have a children.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And the next little one is
for the first menstruation

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:84%
as the body starts
preparing itself,

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:84%
the young girls to be able to
give birth the following cave.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're here,
Rosella, and this

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.903 align:middle line:84%
is the spot that is
said to be-- well,

00:12:28.903 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:90%
you've been here many times.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.078 align:middle line:84%
This was the initiation
ritual for the girls,

00:12:33.078 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:90%
the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And here, we have a little
tiny well with water.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think you said
you told us that this is

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:90%
where they put their fingers.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Exactly.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.300 align:middle line:84%
They kind of anoint themselves
with water, cleanse themselves.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And then in here, you
brought a gynecologist in

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.390 align:middle line:84%
to look at the cave,
to actually look

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:90%
at the feminine nature of it.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And here, we have
what looks like more

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.240 align:middle line:84%
of the female anatomy, a
uterus, and a swollen belly.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So the floor is where the
actual ritual took place, right?

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's go inside.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Ah, nicely prepared.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.355 align:middle line:90%
It has two little--

00:13:16.355 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:90%
little sitting areas.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And the ritual must
take place right here.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Rosella, this is really
beautiful inside here

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Each cave has a
different frequency.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: Exactly.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:90%
OK, all different frequencies.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:84%
This one, this
particular one, you

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:84%
can see by the anatomy
of the birth canal

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and the area that looks
like a pregnant belly

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.042 align:middle line:84%
that this one was for the ritual
of preparing for giving birth.

00:13:42.042 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Exactly.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.160 align:middle line:84%
This represents the shape
of a pregnant belly.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
yeah, very much so.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, the women
would come inside.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Even now when they
come inside, you

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:84%
say sometimes they feel like
they're actually giving birth.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:84%
When we follow the
steps of each chamber,

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:84%
they arrive here
and start feeling

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.185 align:middle line:90%
the symptoms of giving birth.

00:14:03.185 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it makes them
feel the physical sensation

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.460 align:middle line:90%
of giving birth.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And you've been in these
caves and brought people here

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.300 align:middle line:90%
many times.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:90%
There were other chambers.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:84%
There's another
chamber in particular

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that has very special
spiritual significance to you.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:90%
But it was hidden.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't see it.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And also, you said it's
not a place where you would

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:90%
take a camera and other people.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:90%
It's very personal.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Please tell us about
where happened to you

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:90%
when you went into that cave.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.785 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:14:31.785 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: Well,
this happened one Sunday

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:84%
when my friends and
I were exploring

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:90%
the other side of the site.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.150 align:middle line:84%
We discovered a very
small chamber, which

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:90%
was divided into two parts.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Inside this chamber,
I was left by myself

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:90%
because we were in shifts.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I felt
an out of body experience

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:84%
as if I was a part
of the cosmos.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.700 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
beautiful experience,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
very different from
the other chambers.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Because in the others, you
could feel your own body.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And since we were
separated in shifts

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and all experienced
the sensation,

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
we had agreed that the
sensation experience

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
was of the woman making
contact with the cosmos.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So the cave is
called Domus De Janas, which

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:10%
has to do with the spirits
or the entities that are

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:10%
associated with those caves.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And you say that in
Sardinia, there's

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:84%
a rich history of fairies
and the Jana and so forth.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: This very small
Domus De Janas is much smaller

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.520 align:middle line:84%
than the chambers
of Sant'Antonio.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:84%
The locals believed,
because of its size,

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:84%
that it was
inhabited by fairies.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:84%
We can assume that the
civilization that built

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:84%
the Sant'Antonio Domus De Janas
had a very elevated knowledge

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
capable of energizing
the walls with frequency.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And who built those chambers
were known as priestesses

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that later would guide
the rituals with always

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.845 align:middle line:90%
a feminine presence.

00:15:59.845 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: There's four caves,
man made caves in here.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them is
ever so slightly off target.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:17.534 align:middle line:10%
So it starts off at 164
degrees, ends up at 188.

00:16:17.534 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:84%
This is so that each
entrance is tracking

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:84%
a different object in the
sky during the same evening.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So it starts off in one
cave and it ends in another.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And the acoustic in each
one is very, very different.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So that each one was used
for a very different purpose.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.023 align:middle line:84%
They seem to sort of go up,
and they go down and then up.

00:16:40.023 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:84%
If you speak with
a low voice, you

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:84%
sound like there's four people
talking at the same time.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:84%
If you speak in
a high voice, you

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:84%
start getting more into the
rhythm of the actual cave.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:10%
If you go down, again
that's natural echo.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, Freddy, when you
were out there and in the cave

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and we have this lovely image
of you there, first of all,

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Rosella was saying, men are
not supposed to be here.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.700 align:middle line:84%
They stay way away
on the mountain,

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:90%
away from the women's caves.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, we didn't know all that.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So our modern men have wandered
down and went into the caves.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Because one does.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your own
experience of what it felt

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.052 align:middle line:90%
like in that cave.

00:18:02.052 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: It was kind of
like going into a womb,

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.020 align:middle line:10%
literally,
metaphorically as well.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:10.040 align:middle line:10%
The whole site is designed to be
almost like a uterus, in a way.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of funny
how your feelings

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
interact with the way

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:84%
the space is actually designed
and where it's located.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it was a very
introspective place.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:84%
A place where you go into
these incubation chambers.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And you feel very
much as though you

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.290 align:middle line:84%
are kind of giving birth
metaphorically and physically.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I totally understood
what was going on there,

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.480 align:middle line:84%
even though it's been going on
for so many thousands of years.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like
going back in time

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and reliving centuries
and thousands of years

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:90%
of incubation.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Feelings that
go beyond expression.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
This was, to me, just really
an amazing experience.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:90%
And it very feminine in nature.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Even as Freddy said, this was
a very flowing, very feminine,

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:90%
non-mental kind of energy.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.270 align:middle line:90%
It was charging.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And you could, as
we talked about,

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
feel the difference
in each case.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But Rosella was saying the
men shouldn't have been there.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.177 align:middle line:84%
I remember that because this
was a woman's initiation place.

00:19:11.177 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hate to say
this because I'm not

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:84%
like militant, a militant
feminist on any level.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I like to see the bridging
between the sexes.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's about is
bringing the two together.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But I had this really
visceral reaction when

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:90%
the guys crawled in the cave.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:90%
It was almost militant.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like the mama
bear in me was like,

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.323 align:middle line:90%
they shouldn't be here.

00:19:31.323 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And when they started
toning and putting

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
all these masculine
tones in the caves,

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.612 align:middle line:84%
I was just viscerally
kind of shaken by it.

00:19:38.612 --> 00:19:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I was too actually.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:90%
I was too.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because this was
supposed to be like another--

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:84%
but they were curious
like anybody would be.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:19:45.493 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not blaming them in any way.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:84%
We had the guys in the cave
with us taking the film anyway,

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:90%
doing the film.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, that's right.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean, it
was already that way.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
about toning in there.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But it was kind of
interesting because it

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:90%
started raining like crazy.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it prohibited
you from getting up

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:84%
in some of those caves because
you had slippery shoes on.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, that's
what Rosella told me.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:84%
She said, Paola, if
it starts raining,

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
don't even try because they
are so slippery that you

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:90%
can hurt yourself.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.163 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I don't
want to end this.

00:20:13.163 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
end this this way.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I had to go up there.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: So I was watching you.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But I was fascinated
just like you were.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what happened
when it was all said and done,

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.120 align:middle line:84%
each of the men literally
slipped down the rocks

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:90%
at one point in the day.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And our poor
videographer Sebastian,

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:84%
he was holding onto the
camera as his feet slipped.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.058 align:middle line:84%
And he was sliding down 15,
20 feet away of wet rock.

00:20:37.058 --> 00:20:38.767 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, he
was saving the camera.

00:20:38.767 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was in shock
watching this because he

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:90%
was saving the camera.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.158 align:middle line:90%
But he slipped down.

00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh my god,
what's going to happen?

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The whole time it was
like, the camera, the camera.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, he had a nice
round of applause,

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:84%
but he was all dinged
up with bruised up

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:90%
knee and scraped skin.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But none of the women
lost their footing at all.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:90%
We did just fine.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:90%
None of the women fell.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, hey, maybe it's
the local jinn saying, guys,

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.320 align:middle line:90%
don't come in here again.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
There was a correlation between
these caves and an experience

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:90%
you had in Orkney.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.820 align:middle line:84%
As if Orkney isn't remote
enough to begin with,

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
there's also the
remote island of Hoy.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So you take a little
boat across there.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Two massive mountains, and
there's one megalith, in fact,

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:90%
it's a monolith.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge rectangular
slab of ancient sandstone.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:84%
It's been hollowed
out like a laser.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And it faces exactly,
and I mean exactly west.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly aligned.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And you go in there, and it
has exactly the same alcoves,

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
the same cuts, and
the same shape,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and the shaving of the
interior as the site

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:90%
that we went through as well.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:90%
That completely blew my mind.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another energetic
tie from the north.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yes, and also
connecting the two places

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.018 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This is very
important actually.

00:21:56.018 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was we're discovering
this as we're walking along.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.553 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
people of the Danube

00:22:00.553 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:84%
coming from central Europe
from the north into Sardinia.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:10%
Well, in the Irish
tradition, when

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:10%
the giants, I'm
talking real big giants

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.470 align:middle line:10%
were there, the Formoire,
they were basically

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:10%
saying that after the
Formoire were there,

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:10%
the Tuatha de Danann, who is a
variation of the Tuatha Danu,

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:10%
from the Black Sea.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
They came all the way from
the north into Ireland.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't get much further
north at the end of the ice age

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:90%
than north Scotland and Orkney.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So now we have
the same tradition

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:84%
of the people in Sardinia
also going through Norway,

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:84%
through Sweden, into Orkney,
leaving their little vestige

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
of their habitation there
and the stone circles

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
they have there as well
about the same time

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:84%
period as they're appearing
in Sardinia, by the way.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.417 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:41.417 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And then they come
down to form the royal bloodline

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.390 align:middle line:84%
of Ireland and
Scotland, again, tall,

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.430 align:middle line:90%
redheaded with light skin.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we get
the Nordic and Scandinavian

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.670 align:middle line:90%
appearances from.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.440 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones who
bred that bloodline

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
in that part of the world.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So we do see an overlap
here between Scotland

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient
civilization of Sardinia.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.437 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea.

00:23:00.437 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I was literally making
this up as I'm going along.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm watching the overlaps.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, this
is why I love my job.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the spirit
of a place just helps

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:90%
you make those connections.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So we go back to the
shining ones once again.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:84%
The shining one or the
Annu, when they came,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:84%
they came as a group of
eight in each of the cultures

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.620 align:middle line:10%
And the one who was the wisdom
keeper for the whole group

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:10%
was always a woman.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So a woman always
accompanied them.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:84%
But again, you say that the
knowledge seeded by the shining

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.870 align:middle line:84%
ones included the
presence of women.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.520 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't all men.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
female that was present

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:84%
among the shining
ones, the watchers,

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:90%
those who seeded knowledge.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Yeah, these are
all sages essentially.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: They had another
word for them called

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:49.010 align:middle line:84%
the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],, and
they appear all over Sumeria.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.350 align:middle line:84%
They were protective
people, not just spirits.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:90%
They were protective people.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was a council that
was run by eight people.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:90%
One was a woman.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.617 align:middle line:84%
And these eight people were
all bearers of the ring.

00:24:00.617 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:84%
This is where the story of
Lord of the Rings comes from.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.575 align:middle line:84%
The late Laurence
Gardner had picked up

00:24:04.575 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:84%
on this story
through his research

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
into the old lineage of the
Anu, from his connections

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:90%
with special libraries.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was amazing.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:84%
We just want to take a moment to
say thank you Lawrence Gardner.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I loved his work.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:10%
And the man was he
was a wonderful man.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:18.840 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: I wouldn't
be talking about this

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:10%
if he hadn't been around.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.765 align:middle line:84%
So the thing I
found more impactful

00:24:23.765 --> 00:24:25.390 align:middle line:84%
than any part of the
published stories,

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.480 align:middle line:84%
how the woman, the lone
woman in this group of people

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.883 align:middle line:90%
was the wisdom keeper.

00:24:29.883 --> 00:24:31.300 align:middle line:84%
She was the central
pivotal member

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:90%
of the entire organization.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And also, she was
the one through which

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.490 align:middle line:84%
the bloodline, the
sacred bloodline

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:84%
or the divine
bloodline runs through.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Fast forward the story
about 5,000, 6,000 years.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:90%
We're now in Sumeria, 3,000 BC.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:90%
And you have the woman in red.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:84%
She is the person who is
basically the tutelary goddess

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:90%
of the entire temple structure.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was because of her
that we have all these rituals

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and initiation practices
into this sacred wisdom.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So the woman who was basically
at the forefront of the temple,

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:90%
she wore a crimson robe.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.180 align:middle line:84%
The woman in red, this is
where the story goes back to.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.730 align:middle line:90%
The robe was called a ritu.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.630 align:middle line:84%
This is where we get
the word ritual from.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.180 align:middle line:90%
And it means truth in Sumerian.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So she was the wisdom
keeper of the truth.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:84%
The bearer of the truth
for the entire culture.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So it was through
her lineage that we

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:84%
get a divine bloodline spreading
eastwards through Asia Minor.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Ends up historically where
the women in red in Galilee,

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene, who was not
her real name, by the way.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.250 align:middle line:90%
It was just a title.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And from that, they merge
into the Merovingian bloodline

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and the Scythian bloodline
of the lords of Anu

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:84%
who then become the royal
houses of Europe, and also,

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:84%
through intermarriage, with
the royal house of Egypt.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And from that, they basically
set the royal bloodlines

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.110 align:middle line:90%
of Ireland and Scotland.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And all this is established
record at this point.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
of that that we

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.760 align:middle line:84%
have the argy bargy with the
Carolingians, who were set up

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
by the church as a wonderful
light and dark battle

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:84%
to take over the
control of Europe.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
We're now getting into the
early medieval era in Europe.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.853 align:middle line:90%
And that's a whole other story.

00:26:04.853 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is where the
story of the women

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.490 align:middle line:84%
is so important, that
they were the true wisdom

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
keepers, the bearer of
the sacred knowledge,

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and also the people who also
were able to manipulate energy

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:84%
and the human body
in a certain way

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:84%
that allowed you to have
not just the incubation

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.315 align:middle line:84%
experience that
we had at the site

00:26:19.315 --> 00:26:20.940 align:middle line:84%
but also had the out
of body experience

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.520 align:middle line:84%
mentally where you
travel to other worlds,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.780 align:middle line:84%
return back with
specialist information.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.580 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
like the way you've

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:90%
described the women in red.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.322 align:middle line:84%
Because the way my grandpa
put it, if you wore red,

00:26:31.322 --> 00:26:33.030 align:middle line:84%
you were a Jezebel,
and you went to hell.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Shorter story.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Not as inspiring.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.465 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how the
religious implications,

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:42.960 align:middle line:84%
the politics of religion
turns it upside down.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.637 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Along
with the pentagram.

00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I mean like
the devil only shows up

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:90%
three times in the Bible.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And usually, he's a
pretty helpful guy.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: So there you go.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Different folks, same strokes.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.535 align:middle line:90%
So you know?

00:26:55.535 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny how these
spirit forms, which

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:84%
is the essence of the spirit
form that was there originally,

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.775 align:middle line:84%
this place in the rock, in
the memory of the stone,

00:27:03.775 --> 00:27:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and they always take on this
essence of very tall people.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they have
the same story not far

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.690 align:middle line:90%
from Sardinia in North Africa.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.120 align:middle line:84%
The women used to
consult the mounds

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:84%
of the fairies,
the jinn, and they

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:84%
used to connect with
the female deity,

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.780 align:middle line:84%
the female overarching
spirit of the mounds.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And they said that they used
to appear in the form of very

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.730 align:middle line:90%
tall people.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was
what they experienced.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So even in
the spirit world,

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:25.878 align:middle line:84%
they also take on
the form of giants.

00:27:25.878 --> 00:27:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was an interesting
parallel with Sardinia.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:90%


00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.590 align:middle line:10%
If you actually read properly
the original story of Enoch

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:10%
and the Babylonian and
the Mesopotamian version,

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:10%
it's very clear that the
Annu and the Annunaki,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:10%
which means people of
Annu, there were helpers.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.070 align:middle line:90%
They were spiritual people.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:47.187 align:middle line:84%
The watchers come in on the
side as the side members

00:27:47.187 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:90%
of that group of the Annu.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:49.437 align:middle line:90%
They're like the go between.

00:27:49.437 --> 00:27:52.125 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Greeks called them
the messengers, the egregore,

00:27:52.125 --> 00:27:54.060 align:middle line:84%
where we get the
concept of angels from.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.480 align:middle line:90%
But they were real people.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So they were the point
of go between the Annu

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.252 align:middle line:90%
and human beings.

00:28:00.252 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And the watchers, again,
were considered to be sages.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.403 align:middle line:84%
They had their own
understanding of life.

00:28:04.403 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
This is where the story
gets a little bit fragmented

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.737 align:middle line:84%
because there was a small
group of the watchers that

00:28:08.737 --> 00:28:09.960 align:middle line:90%
defied orders.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.400 align:middle line:90%
And they went to Earth.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And they met with women
because they said we like them.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:90%
We want to hang out with them.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
where you really

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.040 align:middle line:84%
start getting more of the
Luciferian story involved.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This is where we get
to the dark side of the story

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.450 align:middle line:84%
where they defied orders
not to mate with humans.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fallen angels.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because they
said, our DNA and theirs

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.090 align:middle line:90%
is not going to mesh.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Human women and watchers
make strange bedfellows,

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:90%
metaphorically and physically.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:29.410 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we
get the Nephilim, which

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.083 align:middle line:84%
they call the bastard sons
of the fallen watchers.

00:28:34.083 --> 00:28:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny how they
get all the attention.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But all the good people, the
majority of the good people

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.900 align:middle line:90%
get thrown out of the window.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But the ones who fell
by the wayside who

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:84%
did mate with human women,
they gave birth to infants.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So the women died
during childbirth.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.950 align:middle line:90%
The Hopi still talk about this.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
They said that basically, this
created these bastard offspring

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.640 align:middle line:90%
called the Nephilim.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And Nephila is an old Hebrew
word that actually means Orion.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So they were the children,
the bastard children

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:90%
of the children of Orion.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.520 align:middle line:90%
So we had that connection again.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So it was from here that the
true giant people, the Gigantes

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:84%
people suddenly come
about because we've

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.010 align:middle line:84%
gone from eight to 10
feet to 15 feet to 18 feet

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:90%
to 24 feet in one case.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And this is what
prompted the lords of Annu

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to say, this has gone
completely out of control.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.000 align:middle line:84%
We need to either bring
these people in, tell

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.895 align:middle line:84%
the humans to behave, tell the
bastard watchers to behave,

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:25.770 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to have
to wipe out the Earth.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.478 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to basically conspire

00:29:27.478 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:84%
to create a flood,
which is essentially

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:90%
what they were saying.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:84%
We're able to use
the power of will

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:84%
to move fragments
of a comet to create

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.480 align:middle line:90%
this massive deluge on Earth.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So they had power over
nature for certain.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what brought the
whole thing crashing down.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.160 align:middle line:84%
They had to get rid of these
small group of watchers

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.860 align:middle line:84%
who created the Nephilim, who
created all the problems here

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were considered
to have preyed on people.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:84%
They were even
considered to have been--

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Barbaric.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --barbaric
and even cannibalistic.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even and
Native American history,

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:84%
they say that they were
slaying the giants of the day

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:90%
because they were cannibals.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
were afraid of them.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:02.843 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:30:02.843 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:90%
They completely lost the--

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.780 align:middle line:84%
It's as though being in the
physical form for these people

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.270 align:middle line:84%
was really, really difficult.
The watchers already found

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.863 align:middle line:84%
it difficult. The Annu found
it difficult to begin with.

00:30:11.863 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they said, do
not interact with the humans.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: First of all,
you're interfering

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.880 align:middle line:84%
with the development,
the natural development

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.680 align:middle line:90%
of a species.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't be doing that.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.930 align:middle line:90%
You can assist and suggest.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Like go and tell
about agriculture.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And then come back
to the encampment,

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.603 align:middle line:84%
to the islands, all
the missing lands.

00:30:29.603 --> 00:30:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we just
leave them alone.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Let them get on with it.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Let them develop in
their own course.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But whatever happened,
we don't know

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.980 align:middle line:84%
why this small group of people
decided to go against orders

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and created all the
problems that we have.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But I just find it terrible
that they get all the attention.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And all the other
people, the real sages

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:90%
are left by the wayside.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
travesty of history.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.638 align:middle line:90%
And we need to stop it.

00:30:49.638 --> 00:30:51.940 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop highlighting
that particular aspect

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:90%
of history.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.777 align:middle line:84%
So we're here to do our
little part in that.

00:30:54.777 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Keep it positive.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Keep it positive.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:90%


00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.645 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:09.645 --> 00:31:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: We
can say that Sardinia

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.760 align:middle line:84%
is very popular for the
many people that talk

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:90%
about the giants and fairies.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And the central
region of Sardinia

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.950 align:middle line:84%
has its own popular stories
and myths told by its elderly.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's beautiful to
listen to their stories

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.695 align:middle line:84%
and go explore the sites
featured in those stories.

00:31:28.695 --> 00:31:30.880 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there is a
history, a rich history,

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.540 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like, of the
lore of the fairy folk,

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:84%
as we call them, the little
fairies and the wee people.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.110 align:middle line:90%
But what about the giants?

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.550 align:middle line:84%
What does the average Sardinian
feel about the presence

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.040 align:middle line:90%
of giants in Sardinia?

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.192 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:49.192 --> 00:31:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: They talk
a lot about the giants

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.730 align:middle line:90%
especially the elderly.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.110 align:middle line:84%
They will tell stories
of finding big bones

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%
in the fields that could not be
of an animal or a human being.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But people would not pay
much attention to them.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And later, it was discovered
a statue of a giant

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.080 align:middle line:84%
that you can see in
the Cagliari Museum.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And all the stories surrounding
it are very interesting.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is your
understanding regarding

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:84%
the connection between
Atlantis and Sardinia?

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.208 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:32:20.208 --> 00:32:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: I think the
old civilization of Sardinia

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.050 align:middle line:84%
was very knowledgeable
and most likely

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:27.780 align:middle line:90%
were ancestors of Atlantis.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.490 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to find
evidence and proof,

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
but there is a lot of research
surrounding those facts.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And most certainly, if you visit
places like Domus De Janas,

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Villa Sant'Antonio,
all the healing sites,

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.720 align:middle line:84%
everyone that has visited those
places have felt the vibrations

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.150 align:middle line:90%
and even improved their health.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So I believe the
Atlantis civilization can

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.510 align:middle line:90%
be found all around the world.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that it also
arrived here in Sardinia.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So you have
been absolutely invaluable

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.730 align:middle line:10%
to this entire trip here
because you're Sardinian,

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:00.900 align:middle line:10%
you know the story.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And you were the one that
originally introduced Paola

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.460 align:middle line:90%
to Luigi.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:10.380 align:middle line:84%
How did you initially find Luigi
and what were your opinions

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.210 align:middle line:90%
about Luigi and his work?

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.593 align:middle line:90%
>>LODDO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER:
When I participated

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.410 align:middle line:84%
in the frequency of
archeology course,

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:21.240 align:middle line:84%
we visited a
village in Sardinia.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And through mutual friends,
we ended up meeting Luigi.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.917 align:middle line:10%
And his story is
really impressive.

00:33:26.917 --> 00:33:28.500 align:middle line:10%
When he would tell
us the story of how

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:10%
he bumped into a
skeleton of a giant

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.460 align:middle line:10%
and he's found so
many other things,

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:10%
like a tooth, et cetera,
I believe his story

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.885 align:middle line:10%
is very interesting and true.

00:33:38.885 --> 00:33:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's on the
verge of becoming

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.610 align:middle line:90%
known by everyone in the world.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: God this is beautiful.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Orion suddenly appears
above this flattened area.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is a beehive.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.383 align:middle line:84%
All these little
crevices and walkways.

00:34:01.383 --> 00:34:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have a
little meditation in here.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.170 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.360 align:middle line:84%
We've been out in the field
about a week together.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And we've been around the island
and looked at the mysteries,

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:14.460 align:middle line:90%
and we've held the bones.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:18.120 align:middle line:84%
You have a really very
specific take on all this

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:90%
that I think is important.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:20.969 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
it's very important.

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Because when I came here years
ago, I was hoping somebody

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.489 align:middle line:90%
would cover this story.

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And for me, field
research, in my career,

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.139 align:middle line:84%
field research is the only
kind of research I do.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And that means
talking to the people,

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.409 align:middle line:84%
getting witness testimony,
being on location,

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.750 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
history of what you're

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.320 align:middle line:84%
talking about and
not in isolation,

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.000 align:middle line:90%
putting together the puzzle.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.590 align:middle line:10%
And I think we did that.

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.310 align:middle line:90%
I think that was pretty cool.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.760 align:middle line:84%
We were able to put
together a puzzle

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:84%
and insert some theories
about this because this is BC,

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.910 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years BC that
all this was going on.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.290 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's important.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the history of the
human race and other races.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.870 align:middle line:90%
And we did it.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.870 align:middle line:84%
We actually survived
a lot of obstacles,

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:11.170 align:middle line:90%
and it was field research.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And each one of us, I think, had
a very different kind of agenda

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.790 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our own
personal curiosity.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with Freddy,
it was very clear.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.390 align:middle line:84%
He's looking at it from an
archeoastronomy point of view,

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:25.050 align:middle line:84%
looking to see, are these
part of those groups of people

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.480 align:middle line:90%
that were aligned to Orion?

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And so he was able to
successfully, and he did.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:84%
He brought his
instruments in and he

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:35.025 align:middle line:84%
did the north-south
readings himself

00:35:35.025 --> 00:35:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and verified it because
we were in the field.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was so thrilled
to say, I've seen this.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.920 align:middle line:90%
I've seen this from Google Maps.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's nothing like
being in the field with it.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I was
particularly fascinated

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and always have been, still
am about the story of Atlantis

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and what happened before
the final devastation.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Where did those people go?

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Was that knowledge
then maintained

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.240 align:middle line:90%
throughout other civilizations?

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Which, in Freddy's eyes, it was.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And how the people of
Sardinia feel so closely

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.720 align:middle line:84%
allied with the
Atlantian heritage.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.775 align:middle line:84%
I found that a
fascinating aspect of it.

00:36:11.775 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And you also learned
a little Italian, I think.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I learned a little.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I got to where I could kind of
understand Luigi and Rosella

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:18.370 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:19.578 align:middle line:90%
And I know a couple of words.

00:36:19.578 --> 00:36:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I can get an espresso
just fine at a cafe.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:27.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think to be able to each
come with our own curiosity

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and have some things
answered, but I

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:33.480 align:middle line:84%
think even more so what
I love about this trip is

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that it opened up even
more possibilities and more

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.080 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It made for a more vast horizon
of exploration than the stories

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.420 align:middle line:90%
we've been told up until now.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very,
very important

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.130 align:middle line:90%
that people understand that.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And culturally, we all
got something from this.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:52.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, even the camera crew.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:55.860 align:middle line:10%
Everybody that was
involved in this venture

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.500 align:middle line:10%
really enjoyed it
because, culturally,

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:10%
we not only mixed
with the people.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.700 align:middle line:90%
We learned so much.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was amazing.

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:09.500 align:middle line:84%
For me, I had never done
this intense research here.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't
really your bailiwick.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, it wasn't.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:17.250 align:middle line:10%
But, boy, was it ever something
that I'm going to follow up on.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And above
everything else,

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I just adored, and I think we
all did, the Sardinian people.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:84%
We found them warm,
welcoming, helpful, just

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.450 align:middle line:90%
really kind people.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was a win
on every single level.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.750 align:middle line:84%
We all here at Gaia hope
you enjoyed this journey

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:90%
as much as we did.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.080 align:middle line:84%
It's been fabulous to
be out in the field

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and be able to
touch these stones

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and feel the energy of peoples
from the past in meditation.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:47.340 align:middle line:84%
All of it has been really
enriching to us on many levels.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you're curious enough,
you can come do it too.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I know that this
is a surrogate for

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.370 align:middle line:90%
your own personal experience.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But I would encourage
anybody to come to Sardinia

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and start poking
around on your own.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.003 align:middle line:84%
Go into those caves and
the nuraghi on your own.

00:38:00.003 --> 00:38:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think you too will fall in
love with the Sardinian people.

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.370 align:middle line:10%
So until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.440 align:middle line:10%
